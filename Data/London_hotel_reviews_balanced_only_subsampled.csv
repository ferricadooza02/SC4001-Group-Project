Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''nice visit but did not feel special. upgraded to superior room on top floor (extra 35) so big room &amp; nice drencher shower. room was very nicely done out. did not have a bar just for residents, so meant we could not get a table for pre dinner cocktails but sat at the bar and was fine. rooftop bar does not open on sundays even at bank hols which was a shame. for the rate we got it was good, but did not have anything of a wow factor to justify top price. did not feel the service made it feel like a special experience. in summary, nothing wrong with it but feel there are nicer places to stay for time away together.'''",1
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''we stayed for a few days in october, and it was a perfectly adequate hotel for our needs (a few days of leisurely sightseeing/shopping/eating). the location is wonderful- right at the hyde park corner tube stop, and across the street from hyde park. we enjoyed morning walks/runs/coffee every morning of our stay. there are a few pubs/restaurants nearby, as well as the bar/restaurant of the hotels in that area, but it is more of a residential/embassy area. our room was fine, although on the first floor and a mostly frosted glass window with not much light coming through. the marble bathroom with heated floor is a nice touch! everything was clean. the reason i gave it 3 stars is actually the service. most people were polite, but there was were a few distinctive &amp; unhelpful interactions during our stay. first, we arrived pretty early from an international, overnight flight. we were obviously kind of tired and hoping they might have a room available, although fully aware they may not. we arrived to the hotel around 8:30am, and a room was not offered to us until 2:15pm. we had a very overpriced breakfast in the hotel, went for a long walk, and came back around 11:30, at which point we needed to change for a lunch. they offered us the stairwell &amp; lobby bathrooms to change in...which was really not very useful, although we did it. the other main issue i had was that their service in terms of our room &amp; belongings was rather invasive. they sent a butler to show the ""room features"", and then at turn down on the first night, they did quite a bit of unnecessary &amp; unwelcome unpacking of our clothes. they put things in the closet that we had to search for when we returned, and even put some clothes (some of which were our pajamas!) into the hotel laundry bag. i do not know if most people use the laundry service, but we were there for only a few days and it was most annoying for them to presume (and select which clothes) that we would send out our laundry. these were minor incidents, but because the place prides itself on service, i found this incongruous. we also asked twice to use the hotel car, and it was not available either time. we got a fairly good deal, and with the comfortable bed, clean bath &amp; great location, i would have felt like it was a place i could recommend. the invasive nature of the daily cleaning &amp; turndown services however truly detracted from our experience.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''lovely furnishings, amenities and service. however, when returning to my suite early one afternoon, i discovered an unexpected visitor. unbeknownst to the ""visitor"", i had observed him entering my room from a distance. he appeared to be a maintenance person but later i realized he may have had more in mind than maintenance. | some indicators: he did not place notification of his presence on the door so i would be aware of him before i entered; when i entered i called out and he did not reply or in any way acknowledge his presence (he may have thought i was housekeeping and would leave without discovering him in this fairly large 4 room suite); even as i entered the sitting room, he did not make himself known; once i observed him, he did not identify himself; his stance and location in the very center of the bedroom with no tools in hand was awkward; his explanation of repairing the ceiling chandelier which was - and had been - working perfectly was obviously fabricated on the spot; his sardonic remark as he quickly left was frightening. in hind sight i believe this person had malicious intentions. | all was reported to management. i requested a change of locking mechanisms but this request was declined. i was offered a fresh pot of tea. | after returning home, i had a brief email communication with the head of maintenance who assured me it was a maintenance employee who had entered to replace a light bulb. however he failed to explain why the man did not have a ladder with him as the light bulbs would not be visible without being able to see above the shades which were about 7 to 8 feet above the floor, much less be able to replace the bulbs. | i also sent an email to the regional office about two weeks ago and have yet to receive a reply. | add to my experience the feeble fairy tale told by maintenance, the failure of a response from regional, and the casual attitude of the manager on site, it does appear there are security issues. management does not want to discuss the problem, of course, because of negative publicity. | in hindsight i should have reported this to the police. i would advise not to stay at this hotel.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed here for 3 nights and was expecting it to be 'wow' but must say i was disappointed. last time we were in london we stayed at the soho hotel which we were very impressed with and thought this hotel would be of a similar standard. sadly it was not.we had a room over looking the thames, the room was clean and the bed comfortable but found the decor uninteresting, very little hanging space,the bathroom was an average size . the service we received on checkin was good but found the service in the restaurant where we had breakfast to be lacking. constantly trying to catch there eye for service, all seemed to be wandering around doing everything but giving service. one morning the toaster was not working asked one of the guys he did not know how to work it and walked away. repeatedly i would ask for my flat white coffee to be extra hot never was and gave up. there is no black pepper on the table only salt which i found odd always had to ask for it when i questioned it i was told not enough room on the table!!!! my cup one morning had a chip in it. for this standard of hotel not good enough. we had drinks in the bar one night if you wanted any nuts or chips to nibble on you had to pay for them the drinks were pricey enough add an extra few pence to all the drinks and supply chips or nuts you might find in the end people will stay and in the long run spend more. i did bring these things to the attention of management and in fairness they did send a lovely bottle of wine and cheese to our room with a note of apology. this is not a cheap hotel and expected much more sadly next time in london we will choose a different hotel.'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''visited for a 2 night stay rooms were ok but not plush and we had booked an executive room rang twice for beverage replenishment and never came.sat in the bar in the evening only serve 175ml wine cannot get 250ml ordered ice cream only vanilla strawberry left! the hotel had a wedding on saturday so limited service and on sunday evening no restaurant service at all stayed at the rubens prev much better in all aspects for same deal price with secret escapes.what a shame as location good | so much choice of hotels so why not strive to be excellent''',1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''great location but extremely tiny rooms. also very helpful staff and some nice amenities,such as bathrobes. but the room is disappointing as it is too too small. no space to hardly open up suitcase - which is where you will have to keep all your clothing because there are no drawers and closet is minuscule. probably would not recommend to others. i am currently starting here.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we chose this hotel as it was well situated for our needs. in addition, my sister had stayed at the rembrandt several times before and highly recommended it. | i paid a little extra to have a deluxe/superior room however, what we got was a misshapen corner room with little room to move. if my sister was in bed with her knees up i could not see the tv. i was bitterly disappointed. | we spoke to reception who showed me two other rooms which were worlds apart from my room. why did they stick me in this horrible room when they had other, nicer rooms which apparently the same standard as mine. were they heck! they were 100% more superior. nicer furnishings, bigger and better appointed. | this being said there was one major issue. when we arrived in the new room we left our stuff and when to the bar for a drink. when we got back to the room later that night we had a quick explore. my sister opened a door which led straight through to the next room where a couple were fast asleep. not only was the room not locked but we were able to get into their room. they could have come into our room whilst we were out and stolen anything! | they need to sort this out. | anyway, the bar area was good, the food was lovely and the afternoon tea was very good. but at 250 for a double room for one night i feel robbed for the amount of disruption there was. we complained to the manager who offered me 25% off my next stay. what a load of tosh. next stay? i do not think so .................'''",1

Rhodes Hotel,"'''we booked this hotel in april and visited in late september. the hotel is under remodel- the dining room is closed, there are remodeling supplies all about and the exterior is covered in scaffolding. the breakfast is provided in your room fridge- yogurt, cheese, breads, fruit and tea or coffee. that was actually quite convenient. | the room we had was around the block from the building. there was constant pounding, sanding, banging, singing and cell phone ringing from about 0730 to 1700 each day so do not plan a lie-in or a nap during the day. the receptionist/bell boy/handyman (came to fix our sink drain) said it should be done at november so we would recommend calling before booking. | all that said, the place was dead silent at night, which was grand, and in a most wonderful spot for touristing. very close to parks, tubes, paddington and oxford street. | there are so many hotels in this area, we will look at others the next time we visit.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''popped in for coffee, toast and a diet coke - 18 including service. a bit pricey, but not unexpected given style and location of hotel. would use it again, but only if i had too! there is just not much choice in that immediate area.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed saturday night. staff friendly. we had a delux room, but it did not really feel luxurious, not much for than one of the big chains. had a night cap drink for two and at nearly 40 decided one was enough. it was clean and tidy, but will stay in one of the other more exclusive boutique hotels for about the same or slightly more. breakfast was a buffet, it was very good though, with every choice of food. showing was a bit hit and miss as the water kept going off.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''for many years i had fantasised about staying at the dorchester so when the opportunity arose i jumped at it. needless to say, as one of the great british institutions, it is a lovely hotel however it is not fabulous. it has two lovely dining areas /restaurants albeit pricey. | i was extremely disappointed by the rooms! the corridors were creaky and narrow and the rooms pokey. there is no doubt it was tasteful decorated, however i was noisy -if the internal door was not shut and space was tight with a capital t. the double bed was very compact for 2, there was hardly any space to walk around it! very claustrophobic! on a positive note the bathroom was spacious with delicious toiletries and good high pressure hot showers - and it you are a lover of hotel slippers- this one was good quality. | all in all - charming but not worth the price or reputation- that is in the standard rooms. | a word of advise- do not take your car!'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed here because of a deal on discount site. room very nice, reception staff slow. | everything in room mini bar very very expensive, not sure why hotels do this, as who but a complete idiot buys it??? | coffee in riverside bar very nice. did not have breakfast. | 5 min walk from waterloo past itv building. | cannot really see where this hotel fits in. | tv kept turning itself off. | room looked at a busy building site.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the building is amazing, setting great and excellent location the atmosphere is just what you would expect at a fun and trendy hotel however i was left disappointed from the lack of service from the staff. we arrived at 3:30pm to be told our room was not ready despite check in from 3pm we had to be back out as going to the o2 at 4:30 so upon explaining this to the front desk we were told sorry we are really busy this weekend take a seat and we will let you know when it is ready. half an hour later still nothing we had been left sat in reception... no take a seat in the bar and have a drink on us?! we finally got given our key at 4:15 made our way up to the room which was pleasant enough. breakfast the following morning was ok again great decor and nice food but i found the staff unhelpful did not get offered fruit juice had to ask not refil on tea and coffee despite the restaurant being fairly empty staff just standing around chatting... does not make guests feel very welcome would not stay again after this experience'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i am a frequent traveler and visitor to london, decided to try someplace new. the room was fine, bed comfie, service and staff exceptional, but the lack of turndown service, lack of bedside water bottle, having a decent sized room - especially by london standards, but that looked out on a light well and a tv screen that simply would not stop glowing all night detracted from the exceptional meals and strong service. i would not go back.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i got the booking done just a few days before my travel &amp; this was the cheapest deal in that location. frankly speaking i did not expect much. | the good thing about this hotel is its proximity to paddington station. just get off your flight, board the heathrow express, get down at paddington &amp; in a few minutes you will be at the reception of rhodes hotel. the staff is really friendly &amp; helpful. they give you genuine advise about whatever you enquire.. from buying basic amenities to sightseeing &amp; so on. | the room itself was not bad, but was pretty small with just enough space for my bag (i was in a single regular room, do not know about others). basic things like wardrobe, study desk, t.v., hairdryer &amp; coffee maker were all there but squeezed into this tiny place. i was out most of the time so these things did not make much difference to me. the breakfast was pretty basic with cereals, fruits, buttter-jam-toast &amp; unlimited tea-coffee. however, on my second day the serving person was kind enough to provide me with complimentary fried eggs. | so, if you are on a short trip &amp; wanting to stay downtown with easy access to public transport.... go for it!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''my husband and i stayed at the rembrandt hotel during our first trip to london. reading the rave reviews we opted for this hotel as opposed to the hilton the rembrandt is a nice simple hotel with the basic amenities. the location is great and quick access to the south kensignton tube. the staff were friendly and the hotel was clean. however i did not get the 4 star feel of this hotel. it could very well be a 3 star plus hotel. the full breakfast was very basic and could have had a wider variety. breakfast was quite uncomfortable as we were place quite close to other patrons similar to a dormitory style feeding session. | the rooms were a nice size. the bathroom was clean but the fittings were old. the walls in this hotel were very thin. you can hear the other guests walking past your room. this was very disturbing, if there is one thing that the rembrandt needs to work on then this would be it. | on the whole it was a pleasant hotel to stay at but i will not return as i missed the elegance and sophistication that the rembrandt lacked.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed there for 9 nights. we arrived early in the morning to get our room as we booked an early check in at 10 am. however, the room was not available but nice tina at the reception desk compensate us with an upgrade from superior to executive. the rest of the reception staff are not pleasent to deal with them. the room was clean but a major con that the walls are thin. the breakfast staff are efficient and the breakfast was great. room 257.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''great location between two different tube lines, next to a grocery store with a starbucks. the hotel is very clean, and staff very courteous. my room was unbelievably small for the equivalent of $220 usd, so small that i did not want housekeeping in because i would have to repack for anyone but me to enter! barely room for luggage rack, which i had to request. they have a mat on the bed that says ""luggage here,"" however, i do not like sleeping with my suitcase. breakfast chintzy, so i ate next door at starbucks in the grocery store. i love marriotts and have had good luck with autograph collection, but will not stay here again.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''if i would to highlight the one best place about this hotel it is that it is far enough away from the main city to be very quiet. the front desk was very friendly and they are all wonderful. i wanted a mini-fridge and was not going to use the mini-bar so they just took out all the alcohol that minute so i could use the fridge. the one night they accidentally did restock the fridge front desk i wish i remembered her name came up right away to take it out and was very apologetic. the rooms are very clean and was restocked daily i even had a complaint about the noise because of the cleaning maids making to much noise to early (and it was not their fault the door stop just made a lot of noise) and they adjusted so they would clean that room later so we could sleep in. | the only downsides i could say would be the concierge and the hotel restaurant. in the restaurant you have to (well we had to at least) pay up front 30lbs per person for the meal which is not to pricey as it includes appetizer, main, and desert. i personally did not like anything for an appetizer and my girlfriend did not want desert so i asked if we had to order all 3 courses and could we take some off the tab if we ordered just the main or even replace them with sides (which are not included)? she told me that i could order one course but the price would not change and i was not going to pay that much for just one course with no sides at a hotel restaurant. | | on top of that do your own research for restaurants! the concierge there was no help i mean he would call places that i found to make reservations for us, but he was just doing google searches and came up with the same results i did in my room. i wanted to eat off the beaten path and every night he would say ""i do not know look at convent garden"". | (as a side note when we went to 3 cities in italy every place would recommend places that they would go to eat and out of all the places we only had 1 bad place out of 2 weeks there.) it was very frustrating to find a place as we went during the holidays and every placed was packed. so after a full day (12+hrs) of site-seeing i would have to go back and do research on where to eat for the next day which i wish i really did not have to do.'''",1
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''this hotel is good, but i could not find anything special about it at all. it lacked charm, the personal touch and any feature that would make me remember it. yes it is shiny and new, high tech things in the rooms, tastefully decorated, but for the price it should be. i found the whole place quite 'masculine' in its decor, especially the rooms and downstair bar. not that there is anything wrong with that, but it just did not feel welcoming to me. i had a room over park lane, with a 'balcony' that if you stood on tiptoes or bent right down you could see the park. quite small in size and could have done without having a desk squashed into the corner. | i dined in the restaurant cut and that was an even bigger mystery to me after hearing people rave about it. odd service, we got asked to move tables after they would already brought us bread and water, the sommelier took forever to come and then disappeared, we had two or three different waiters through the course of dinner, the v expensive wagyu beef was nice, but definitely not the best steak in london. it is only memorable to me because i was expecting something amazing and did not get it. | the staff were ok, but not in a stand out way, more i did not really notice them and they did not enhance the stay rather than do anything wrong. | i do not want to sound overly negative because there is nothing really bad with this hotel, but for the money it was underwhelming and there are many other places i would pick in london over this one.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''after saving very hard; i wanted to treat my mum to a ""once in a lifetime"" experience; at the savoy. we did not really want to go in for the formal dining areas, so we opted for a more casual dining experience in the ""thames foyer"". after being seated we were given the menus; i opted for the ""grilled scottish beef sirloin with chunky chips and barnaise sauce"" and my mum the: ""grilled beef fillet burger with bacon, english cheddar and caramelized onion mayonnaise served with chunky chips"". we enjoyed the setting while we waited in anticipation for our main courses. when they arrived it looked quite simply like pub grub. now i understand that we were not in the main dining restaurants and we were not expecting fine dining quality food; but for the price we were paying. we quite simply expected more for our money; especially as the savoy has got a ""supposedly"" exceptional reputation. the main courses tasted average (the chips were slightly undercooked though) and personally i have tasted better (and for a third of the price) at my local pub. we were served by number of different waiters; which seemed quite unprofessional: as if we were an inconvenience to them. it almost seemed as if they needed more direction and communication into their specific roles. the main courses took a while to be cleared; almost as if they would forgotten us. for dessert i had the crispy valrhona chocolate and praline torte with tonka bean ice cream and my mum the caramel hazelnut tiramisu. they were presented in quite an old fashioned way. the chocolate and praline tart tasted wonderful; it had a balance of textures; the sweetness of the praline was balanced out nicely by the bitter chocolate and tonka bean ice-cream. however the tiramisu was not as impressive; the base was soggy (when i think it should have been a crisp base) and the dish was lacking in flavours and different textures. after we had finished our desserts; we felt as if we were being forced out, as the bill was placed in front of us, without us even asking for it. overall i think the setting of the savoy was amazing and since the refurbishment the dcor and features are stunning; but on the other hand i felt as if the staff were very judgmental into whom they gave special treatment too. since being in the hospitality industry myself i think its upsetting that the staff seemed to look down at the average person; who just wanted a special treat and paid over the odds to receive a disappointing experience. i feel that the hotel should take more pride in all of their paying customers and not just the chosen few; after all we are all paying the same price and this experience has seriously affected my views on the reputation of the hotel and what it has to offer.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i gave this hotel three stars based on price charged versus value received. the price charged for rooms is very high, but there are some problems that could be easily addressed. one is that they charge for wifi - really? you get free wifi at a hampton inn, for heaven's sake. i really felt ""nickled and dimed"" by this. also, they very nicely give you your choice of newspaper hanging on your door in the morning, which is a nice perk, but somewhat expected at this level. the problem is that there was not one on the morning we left. if you are traveling, you would actually have time to read a newspaper, and you did actually pay for the room the night before. also, i asked for a top sheet on my bed twice on two separate days from two separate maids and never got one. | on the plus side, the two restaurants in the hotel are some of the best in london, the location is terrific - especially the hyde park side of the hotel, and generally the service was good - but i am still having trouble getting over the wifi thing (apparently a corporate decision), and it has put me off the whole mandarin oriental chain.'''",1

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''having stayed in other mandarin orientals in my time, to be honest this was a little disappointing, bearing in mind the star rating. to start with the positives, the staff were all very welcoming and courteous. nice sized room, great bar, fantastic location for central london. but. the furniture was a little knocked and tired looking, there also was not any communal lounge area to talk about, so if your meeting people there really is not anywhere unless you go to the bar, which is noisy. another bug bear of mine is that you have to pay for the use of the internet, which in this day and age is absurd; it seems the larger hotels feel that they have the right to charge for this service, where as in smaller hotels its free,'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my husband and i stayed at the mondrian hotel last weekend, after purchasing a superior room at a special offer price via secret escapes for my birthday treat and unbeknown to me, he had emailed the hotel to let them know it was a birthday celebration. however, unlike the numerous guests who enjoyed wine, cake and cards delivered to their rooms in acknowledgement of the celebration, he did not even get a reply to his email and not a sign of recognition of my birthday in all the time we stayed | . | nonetheless, we had high expectations of this new luxury hotel which opened its doors on 30th september this year, based in a fabulous location by the river particularly after the all hype and promotional material we had read. | when we arrived we noted that the outside still had a lot of building works going on, and my first thought was, we better not be looking out onto any of that scaffolding! we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who asked us to queue at reception where we would be checked in. this did not take long and we were then escorted to our room which was on the 11th floor, whilst along the way the young guide chatted to us pointing out the various areas of the hotel. | when we stepped into our room we held our breath for the panoramic view of london city as promised on their own website ""all superior rooms feature queen or king beds, custom designed dimmable lighting, bespoke furniture and stunning marble bathrooms indicative of hollywood glamour, complete with malin+goetz amenities. superior rooms also boast some of the hotel's best london views"" well, the hotel was not full but we had a horrible view of a couple of high rise office blocks just outside the window (see the photo we took). | the good bits about the room was the comfortable bed (albeit small we must have had the queen size rather than king) and the bedding was new and fresh thanks heavens we were going to get a decent nights sleep! plenty of lighting and the tv which was mounted on the wall was pretty big. actually, it was mounted too close to the bed so a little uncomfortable to watch not enough thought given to the layout. the lighting all round was in your face and way too intense, we ended up having to switch it off completely because even dimmed right down was still much too bright. | the clothes hanging area (wardrobe) closed with a curtain on a pole, a reflection of the furniture and fittings which are all pretty cheap and tacky and it will not be long before it starts to look shabby. attempts at dramatic effects have been made with low-cost materials and it shows. | the bathroom had a nice shower area, although when in use, the water leaks onto the bathroom floor unless you remember to butt the towel right up to the entrance, and the inch high step between the bathroom and bedroom has you stubbing your toe each time you walk in and out. | the toiletries are generous but not luxurious, very mediocre. | | the tea tray included 2 large mugs and a kettle, also some small sachets of really rank fair-trade instant coffee, sugar sachets and two teabags really, what a poor effort, why bother? for a moment i thought we were in a travelodge! prices of anything on the room menu however, were very much indicative of a 5 star hotel! | the room telephone did not work because it needed to charge! | buffet breakfast was included in the price the next day and we made our way to the restaurant which was not busy although there were more than enough staff milling about. we were given a menu when we registered our names and room number before sitting down. a choice of anything from the table including cereals, fruit, yogurt, cheeses and ham, toast etc. and then either two eggs, bacon and eggs or sausage and eggs. condiments on the table included a small open dish with salt flakes (how unhygienic!) and i had to grab a pepper grinder from another table. you could have your eggs any style and although we chose scrambled, i think they had started out as an omelette and were stirred at the last minute. it was probably one of the worst breakfasts we have eaten in a london hotel although thankfully the coffee was much better than the instant rubbish offered in the rooms and i imagine the river view from the restaurant would be absolutely stunning on a hot summers day with the bi-fold doors open. the furniture in the restaurant again was very cheap looking and uncomfortable to sit for too long. | summing up this hotel - its in a good location - the favourite areas like covent garden, theatre land etc are close by, its new and the staff are friendly and eager - it would naturally appeal to the younger crowds. a huge effort has been made in promoting it but our own experience was very disappointing, we have stayed in some fabulous 5* hotels all over london and by comparison, this one does not even come close. | i cannot imagine it ever reaching luxury standard not even when all the teething problems have been ironed out and would rate it as a quirky 3* and not to everyone is taste by any means. one nights stay was more than enough for us; sadly we will not be rushing back to visit that particular establishment again.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''for me, this was not a five star hotel. check in was brisk but no one offered to take our bags to our room or even show us where it was or where the lifts were. our room was a disabled one, i presume, as i would asked to have a room that adjoined our (grown up) sons. that was fine except the shaving mirror was at hip height and placed for some strange reason in front of the sink so you could not reach the sink properly and when i put make up on i had to do it on my knees! we only had one dressing gown and one bottle of water even though there were two of us staying. the aircon was noisy and woke me up. the view from our room was straight into a load of offices. | having said that, the public areas in the hotel, bars, etc were great, interesting and fun. | it was let down badly by the lack of service though. when we checked out we asked if we could pick up our bags later (yes) so we would left them in our room as we normally do. we were asked to go and fetch them and bring them to the reception, which i refused to do. it was things like this that let it down.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel was absolutely average in every way. the room was fine, loud, but fine. the service was decent, decor was nothing to write home about. we had a few issues with the you.s. outlet and the internet, but they were quickly resolved. the breakfast that was included in our package was really outstanding, however, which made this worth our while. the location was great too...just a short walk to the underground and lots of places to grab dinner and drinks in the area. we used to hotel bar a few nights are were generally happy with the service and drinks there as well. | stay here if you can get a good rate that includes breakfast, and you are going to be sightseeing all day anyway. that is what we did and were happy. we just needed a place to rest our heads, and this was it.'''",1
London Guest House,"'''found the staff very polite and helpful nothing was a problem. rooms not too spacious but clean and given we stayed when london was experiencing sub zero temps very warm. | this is a b&amp;b hotel so no frills - you are restricted to your room once in the building. | breakfast was help yourself to cereals bread fruit etc no full english. | fairly near to the tube and main line services into city. | you would not want to spend a week here as no real comfort area to relax in, | cheap and cheerful is expression to best describe this venue. | would recommend with warning do not expect too much.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i stayed here on a business trip. first impressions were not great as the doorman was nowhere in sight when my cab arrived so i lugged my bag in myself. while some people might like the fact that the reception person comes with you to your room to get the forms signed etc (i presume this is usual?) i did not. a nice touch though was that a complimentary tray of coffee and biscuits was sent to the room after my arrival (which had been early morning following an overnight flight). | i found the room somewhat stuffy - i usually like a classical theme but it somehow did not work for me. i had no view of anything except concrete, and i did not like the fact that i did not have a separate shower. there was also a lot of noise from the passage. on the other hand, the amenities were good, i liked the complimentary bottles of water and apple juice, toiletry/vanity stuff of expected quality etc. | all in all i had a pleasant enough stay here, but felt it did not quite live up to what i would have expected - the mandarin in nyc was much nicer i thought.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this is my second stay at the rembrandt, my first review rated the hotel excellent, this review not so good. i requested a room facing the street and victoria and albert museum, i requested the room 6 months in advance. upon check in the clerk informed me that they did not have a room for me thati requested. i had prepaid for my room. i was asked to change rooms after one day. i really did not want to unpack and pack ,again. i asked the desk clerk why the other guests were not told to move for me and she looked like i had 2 heads,she became rude. since i had pre pay and there is refund,what was i to do. but as soon asi got to room 332,i became very mad. it had to be the smallest room in the hotel with a view of heating/cooling pipes. then figured it out, i pre paid with no refund,they could putin any crummy room they want. i have again pre paid for 2 rooms in november, i just wonder how bad those will be, but since i cannot cancel i will have to stay. i do not recommend this hotel because oft their shady practices.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''my boyfriend and i stayed at the rhodes hotel in september 2006. it came highly recommended by a colleague and the reviews on trip adviser were fantastic. the hotel is around a 5 minute walk from paddington station. we caught the heathrow express to paddington so we found the location very handy. we paid 75 pounds a night for our room, which included taxes and breakfast. chris was lovely and made us very tasty scrambled eggs for breakfast each morning. the room was a decent size for london, however the bathroom and shower were tiny. i understand that hotel rooms in london are very small, so i guess this is to be expected. the interior of the hotel is a little run down and in need of an update. however the outside is lovely. the rhodes hotel is within walking distance of hyde park and there is a bus stop right outside paddington station that will take you to the main attractions. however, i do not think i would stay at this hotel in the future. call me fussy =)'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''when booking i was worried if it is clean and what is the location.. | location - by taxi from london city airport - about 20 min - just 14pounds | the staff is very friendly and will attempt to help you with your enquiries - so ask! | but check how they require your payment and when | the hotel is located not far from green street ( where a lot of asian food and shops are) | if you are looking for a european restorant /cafe - mcdonalds is just 5 min away from teh hotel. we could not find any other cafes around to eat maybe we were just too tired. | breakfast is served with the english breakfast and cereals - but as it is a low budget hotel the food is teh appropriate quality - the papermadeof sausage i could not eat. | for the second day our room was left untouched - no cleaning, changing towels,etc.. | to get to the central london - by bus n25 - just 1 pound per trip - it goes right to oxford circle - a bit long - over 1 hour - but thus you are doing a bit of a sightseeing!'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''we have been visiting the dorchester for more than twenty-five years and have always been very impressed by the level of service. this visit was a distinct disappointment. | we typically book a suite and this vist was no exception. we had booked our suite two months in advance and received an received an acknowledgement. when we arrived we were told that our suite was not ready and they had now idea when during the week we had booked, it would become available. we were offered an ""upgrade"" to their audley penthouse but since we had already stayed in one of their other penthouses on a previous vist and were not happy with it, we declined the offer. finally at 5 pm the guest relations manager who was helping us finally came up with a dorchester suite. ( i have no idea what machinations he had to go through, but he was very helpful. he even comped us to dinner at the grill room.) i was upset that we did have a confirmed reservation, i had been in touch with the hotel earlier in the week about particular amenities, and still they could not provide room we reserved with a big fuss on our part. | since this was a business trip, we were traveling with two i-phones, a laptop and an i-pad. i was told by the e-butler that in addition to the normal twenty+ pound internet charge i would have to pay separate chages for wi-fi for each device. he told me that i could probably argue with the management to avoid these additional charges. interestingly enough, when i did try the wifi connection for my i-pad, it did not work. he then acknowledged that wi-fi connectivity was a problem in this part of the building, i.e. a corner suite. | room service was extremely disappointing. our first morning we ordered an omlet and oatmeal. both were cold. the next morning my husband ordered muelsli it it was good but the portion was miniscule. we ordered proper brewed tea and pumpkin muffins and were served bag tea and some other kind of unwarmed muffins. we had wanted to have a tea with friends in their promenade. we could not get reservations so i ordered room service for five. the offered two pots of tea for five people and inadequate sandwiches. we also seemed to have a ""splenda"" crises. every time they served us tea or coffee, only three small sacks of splenda were offered. it felt like we were going through rationing in wartime london. | i did write a letter to the manager the day before we left telling him about our disappointmet. in addition, i filled out their form asking someone is guest relations to contact me with via e-mail or cell phone. i have not received any contact from the dorchester.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''there is always a bit of a fantasy that one hopes to experience as a guest, a bit of a little white lie that we tell ourselves: that we are a special guest to the hotel. as guests we want to forget that there have been hundreds, thousands before us. the savoy fails miserably in providing one with this sense of uniqueness. the hotel room we were in had a side table that looked as if it had been kicked around by a rugby club. the marble in the bathroom was stained by liters of water that had been left standing on it for days on end. the tiny room was overall uninviting. you just felt like a fool for having agreed to plunk down so much money for the ""experience.""'''",1
The Savoy,"'''top notch service, the staff cannot do enough for you. | everything about the building and staff was perfect. | the only thing that let the hotel down is that even if you are a resident you have to join a waiting list to get into the bar. | this means that people can walk in off the street and enjoy a drink while residents have to go to their room and call room service for a drink. | i have stayed in budget hotels in the past and have been able to get a drink at the bar so why when i pay about 400 (cannot remember the exact amount) per night at the savoy can i not do this simple thing? | for this reason we will not be visiting the savoy again.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''my wife and i arrived at 930 with two cases and backpacks. doorway blocked by one or two members of staff. could not get through the revolving door whereupon one of the doorstops realised and pressed a button to open the side door. we dragged our cases up the flight of stairs to reception. it improved slightly but as we stood there at the corner of the desk two other members of staff kept jostling my wife aside to get labels off the counter. watch the cctv if you are the manager and tell me what you think of the welcome. i did well not to comment but i guessed they were not bothered. i think there may have been a mumbled apology from the taller one when i looked him in the eye. some brief explanation of why my card was being charged an extra 300 and you cannot refuse to accept it! at least the receptionist asked if we needed help with our cases. i declined as i was not sure how long that would have taken. never mind let us see what tomorrow brings. it is certainly not what i watched mmr dixon demonstrate on the hotel inspector to alex polizzi. stay tuned i promise photos tomorrow. rooms are very modern and this a mobile on the desk which says i can use it to call portugal for freeola''',1
The Dorchester,"'''lovely surroundings, with good sandwiches, but the afternoon was spoilt by being overcharged by 37 each! no acknowledgement or apology, which left a surprisingly poor aftertaste. this is the first time this has happened to us. therefore, by all means go, but do state clearly how you would like your card to be charged prior to handing it over.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''taking a slightly different approach to this review - making comparisons with claridges hotel which is my usual go-to hotel in london. | i stayed here after several amazing stays at hotel bel air and beverly hills hotel in la - also part of the dorchester collection. i had assumed this hotel would be the jewel in their crown but sadly not. | on arrival the lobby of the dorchester was a real let down. claridges is gorgeous and really let us you know you are somewhere special. the dorchester was small, dark and the decor was much less impressive that the art deco i had expected. do not get me started on the tacky cars outside of the hotel and the gangs and mobs that hang around - i am so surprised dorchester thinks this appeals to guests. | check in was fabulous, we had a lovely italian girl that made an effort to welcome | us and escorted us to our room. great job! the room was recently renovated and looked lovely. it was spacious and bright with a beautiful marble bathroom. however one towel and the bed spread were stained and i had to ask to have them replaced. the slippers were way too small and they did not have any larger sizes. we watched a movie on the gorgeous b&amp;o but was so dark we could not see it - and you cannot adjust the brightness (nor could the technician they sent). they did however comp the cost of the movie. | i found the restaurant situation at the hotel bizarre. their main space - the promenade - is like a corridor and the decor feels dated. breakfast and afternoon tea were both fine but far from exceptional and i constantly wished i was having a magical experience at claridges. | service was overall pretty good. check in was flawless, the concierge was great and service at the promenade was attentive. my sister did call for some toothpaste which took 25 mins to arrive and she would already left. | let me start by saying this is a good hotel. its not bad. however when i compare this experience to claridges it pales in comparison so i could not understand why anyone would choose this hotel over claridges.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''great location for restaurants and shopping in mayfair belgravia and knightsbridge,its in park lane so easy access every where , rooms are clean smart but no wow factor, they have ruined the down stairs art deco bar, by referb into an arab style club type bar so tacky now. afternoon tea is nice in the hall , i would pass on the restaurant very expensive , service average, had duck for lunch was not able to eat, would not be my first choice of london hotel to stay in, but would be in my top ten in london'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the pictures online are very deceiving. the rooms are small and dark. we asked for the two rooms that had sofas, and i am very glad we did. you can tell that they have been gradually rennovating the rooms. the rooms are clean, as are the stairwells and dining area. the bathrooms are new, with mixing faucets, new tile and fixtures, and very clean. the day we arrived our window was broken and would not shut. the man at the front desk told us not to worry about it. however, after dinner there was a different man at the front desk and when we told him, he came and fixed it right away. the neighborhood is safe and extremely convenient. the street was quiet and we had no problem sleeping either night. the train station and hyde park are less than 5 minutes away. the staff is helpful and kind. the breakfast is continental only for free, eggs or english are an extra charge. | london is so expensive, and this was one of the few places i could find with above average reviews that was affordable for 5 people. if you are from america, think similar service/expectations that you would get from a laquinta or comfort inn, but smaller rooms.'''",1

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''me and my business partner stayed in this hotel, has we had a few meeting. the check in was easy and people were friendly, the rooms where well presented and pretty clean. during our meeting in the coffee area we were not so welcome in their by the staff who usually took long time to serve us plus having the security looking at us with a threatening looking.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''what makes a 5 star, a 5 star? | i personally would not rate the hotel as a 5 star, 4 star plus possibly. | do not get me wrong there is nothing at all wrong with the savoy, it is a very good hotel in probably the best location in london. the rooms are of a large size, the beds are comfortably the bathrooms are great. | for the cost of staying here, i was maybe expecting something a bit more. i suspect alot of the guests at the savoy do not even think the rates are expensive. especially when in the lobby i overhead an american trying to get theatre tickets for mamma mia that night. he was charged by the hotel about 80.00 per head, if he had walked to the theatre approx 10 mins away, would probably not have paid more than 50.00 per head. to the hotel's credit they did advise him of this. | all in all a good hotel, where the location is second to none. to be honest the premier travel inn at county hall is one of the best least expensive hotels that i have stayed in london.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''looks nice from the outside but inside is unkempt. bed had black hairs all the duvet cover, how could house keeping miss that? bedroom was small which was fine for us but the family rooms may not be big enough for everyone. | curtains in the room where filthy, ripped and falling off the window. | the bathroom did look lovely - jacuzzi bath, big shower head and double sink. cleanliness was better in the bathroom. | they provided some breakfast in your mini fridge every day - yogurt, fruit, croissants and juice. | it was disappointing because it could be such a lovely hotel but the cleanliness in the bedroom just was not good enough.'''",1

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''good location, situated off moorgate amongst some lovely buildings. the staff were fantastic, making us very welcome for a special trip. the room was spacious, with an amazing bathroom. free treats, including sweets and bottled water, which was a nice touch. bed was a little too firm for me, however my daughter prefers that and slept like a log. facilities are great. the restaurant put on a very generous and tasty breakfast menu, although the pancakes were a little weird. close to bank and moorgate stations, where between the combined lines and bus routes, you can get almost anywhere in london pretty quickly, which we fully took advantage of. unfortunately there were engineering works going on at the building next door, which commenced too early in the saturday and sunday mornings, spoiling an otherwise peaceful and interesting london location.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this is a lovely hotel, which has a great location for seeing all the sights in london, but there were a couple of things which spoilt the experience. on checking in we were asked if we would like to upgrade. we asked the cost and were told this would be an additional 80 per night to what we had already paid. we decided to treat ourselves and agreed to the upgrade, particularly as the room was immediately available. the upgrade did not include breakfast - disappointing but our fault, we should have checked before agreeing. on checkout we were charged 96 per night for the upgrade. when we queried the cost we were told that we had signed the check in card to say that we were aware that the cost would be plus vat. small writing in a dark reception area. the point i made to reception was to be clear, that when asked the cost of an upgrade, the full cost is given to guests in our case 96 per night or at the very least state it will be 80 plus 20% vat. | i also chose this hotel because i had heard many good things about the hotel's rumpus room bar. it was closed for the duration of our stay - sunday and monday. disappointed, we tried to have a drink in the hotel's other bar. we were asked if we had booked as there was standing room only. no we had not booked as we just wanted one drink after a day's sightseeing. they said we could get a drink and take it to the lobby area where there was seating. we chose to leave the hotel and had a drink at the nearby oxo roof terrace. it is the first time anywhere in the world, i have encountered a feature bar in a hotel being closed or hotel guests being required to book a table for a drink in the bar. in summary, the bedroom was lovely and we had a great view of the river but unfortunately our experience was soured by the lack of clarity on cost and not being able to have a drink in the hotel bar.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''the dorchester obviously has a strong following amongst the well heeled looking for that old school charm. however i never really understood exactly what was so fantastic to justify the 500 pn for what was essentially a small room with a shower inside the bath. something i really loath as climbing into a bath for a shower and invariably struggling with he night if the shower head pretty much is guaranteed to put me in a bad mood. yes the staff are smiling and efficient but i would expect that at any 5 star hotel. breakfast to be honest pretty average. a pancake, 2 pieces od crispy bacon, orange juice and coffee will set you back 32. a bit heavy considering the bacon had burnt edges and 1 day the pancake came with a compote and the next day it did not! wireless access in the rooms was intermittent with varying strength and costs a hefty 19 p.d. laundery of socks at 5 had me just go out and buy a 3 pack. all in all this is a place for the wealthy to enjoy without consideration of the price but left me feeling pretty ambivalent. maybe the new 45 park lane would suit my more modern needs.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we were really looking forward to our stay here. there is no denying it, the hotel is stunning. it was unfortunate therefore that a fire alarm just before 18:00 hours on saturday afternoon / evening threw the hotel into chaos. fire alarms started going off, then stopped, then started again. this went on for a good 5 - 10 minutes. during this time we were trying to get to our room on the 8th floor to collect our belongings and get ready to go out for dinner. in this time the lifts were working one minute and not the next. after trying to take the stairs from the 5th floor we ended up getting stuck in a stairwell as the doors out of the stairwell were locked with signs on them saying ""no escape"". we therefore had to turn back. ironically on other floors (e.g. the 8th floor) a number of fire doors had been propped open. upon finally getting to the 8th floor we bumped into a member of staff (a chambermaid) whom we asked about the alarm going on and off. she simply said ""do not worry, it is just a fire alarm"" and she walked of! upon getting back to our room the alarm had gone off again and this time did not stop. only upon looking out the window did we see people evacuating. surprisingly there was no form of tannoy announcement about the evacuation procedure. i work in a huge office building and whenever the fire alarm goes off there is instruction about when to evacuate (a floor-by-floor procedure). upon exiting the building the chaos did not end. there were no staff around to start with so people were simply milling around by the entrance to the hotel. finally we were told to walk along upper ground. i would have expected at least a few staff to have lined the route to direct people to the assembly point. after about 45 minutes in the cold we were allowed back into the lobby. at no point were there any announcements or apologies from any staff member. no one appeared to take charge. about 1.5 hours later guests were allowed back in. we received a hastily written letter shoved under our room door which barely apologised for the inconvenience. furthermore upon checkout there was no apology given and we were not even asked if everything was okay with our stay. i guess management did not want to open that can of worms! | so, in summary, lovely hotel but really poor service. admittedly a tough situation for the staff but one you would have hoped they would be better prepared for. the overriding feeling the situation left was one of being treated more like cattle (and poorly herded at that!) rather than paying guests.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i am feeling compelled to write this while in the middle of a repeat stay at this hotel. i had stayed at corinthia back in may and had a most wonderful experience - my regret then was having checked in really late and having barely enough time to sleep, much less check out the facilities, though i spent many minutes just pacing around the bathroom marvelling at the under-floor heating. | i would subsequently gushed endlessly to my work contacts about how great this hotel is, focusing primarily on the sheer size of the rooms and the aforementioned under-floor heating. a business trip now in november led to a repeat stay at this hotel, and i kept telling my work mates how awesome it will be. | upon check-in, i was given my key which unlocked a room that seemed to be an after-thought size-wise. (this would be the ""restricted view"" equivalent at a theatre.) it was a whole lot smaller than what i had remembered from my previous stay, and when i logged onto the hotel website to take a quick look, it became quite clear that this was a mis-represented product. the website indicates 345 square feet for the superior king (and helpfully has a scale map and some photos to show what one should expect). there is no way that room clocks in at 345 square feet. when the bellboy brought my trolley luggage to the room and asked where i would like him to put it, i asked him where he would usually put it in this room. he looked somewhat embarrassed as he pushed the luggage flush against the wall at the entrance to the bedroom, so that about a-third of the entrance was effectively blocked by the luggage. i wanted to ask him so what happens when i need to put this on a luggage rack and, you know, open my luggage, but that would have been mean, because there just would not have been a solution. | i headed down to reception to ask if the hotel was fully occupied (it was not) and requested for a room change. i was then asked if i would like to upgrade to the next level of rooms for a fee. it did not dawn upon me right then to ask if accepting the sub-standard room i was given would thus entitle me to a partial refund of the good money i was paying to stay here for two nights, but that would have been funny. i declined to pay to upgrade myself, and requested for just a change, and was told that the room in question was not yet ready. since i was about to head out for dinner, i asked to sort this all out when i returned. | fast forward a few hours and i did get a new room. another bellboy helped bring my luggage over to the new one, and when i remarked how much smaller the other room was, he agreed. i also noted that the room had not been turned down (no chocolate treats for me tonight!). i then headed to the bathroom only to find that the under-floor heating was not working. a call to the reception led them to send an engineer up to take a look. he potted around for a few minutes, before declaring that the under-floor heating and the towel rack was not going to be working tonight, but would be fixed tomorrow, though i could turn up the heat in the bedroom (i am not sure how this would help with the cold floors in the bathroom though). this story has yet to reach its conclusion, so we shall see what happens tomorrow - stay tuned. | as a reader who has gotten this far, you might ask ""why are you making such a big fuss about under-floor heating?"". sure, this remains one of the best london hotels i would stayed at, but this is a hotel that prides itself on being highly-rated and a luxury option in a fantastic location. when you are competing at this echelon, it is the little things that differentiate good from great. people pay good money to stay here, for a certain type of product, and not just simply a bed to rest for the night. i liken this to an airline passenger travelling transcontinental on business class, only to be told his entertainment system is not working and they have run out of food so he will have to pick something from economy class - sure, it gets you to your destination all the same, but it is not quite what you would paid for.'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''i booked the dorchester for the night as a special treat for my birthday. i had booked the superior king room at the special festive rate which was approx. 50% discount off normal rate. on arrival my room was not quite ready so they asked me to wait and have a tea or coffee whilst waiting, after about 15 minutes the head of the promenade room asked if l was waiting for anything, he was fantastic, pierre was his name, told him l was waiting for coffee (obviously the guy l checked in with had not ordered this) and he very kindly gave me lots of information about the hotel which was great. after coffee my room was ready. i asked for a room on a low floor as l do not do lifts, which was arranged. on entering the room l was pleasantly surprised how lovely the room was, but felt pleased that l had received a 50% discount as l would not have paid full rate for such a room, the window overlooked other rooms and a fire escape so nothing pleasant to look out too. on returning to the hotel later in the evening, l wanted to charge my mobile, hunted high and low for a power point and found one by the window.... could not find anymore though, just glad l did not want to dry my hair at the same time! the bed had been turned down and two pairs of comfy slippers were supplied. i decided to put on the tv.... it was very grainy picture on most channels but ok if you wanted bbc1! thought about buying the movie skyfall at 15 but decided against this with the picture so grainy. it was time for bed.....and after about an hour wished l could have got in my car and gone home.... is was the worst bed and pillows l have ever laid on.... it was like laying on a bed of marshmallows... it was the softest bed you could imagine, the pillows were even worse... l can honestly say it was the worst night sleep l had ever had. usually on my birthday l stay in nice hotels in london, last year l stayed at the savoy and the year before the lanesborough...... l have to say the previous hotels were much better sleep wise, customer service wise infact everything. the whole point of booking of this calibre for a special treat is because of the treatment and facilities they provide. the previous two hotels because it was a birthday not only upgraded me but also gave a birthday cake because it was a special occasion... the dorchester supplied nothing..... to which l have to say was surprised. even breakfast the following morning... it was ok but have had better served up at other hotels. such a shame..... but next year l will be going back to the savoy or lanesborough, l will not be hurrying back to the dorchester'''",1

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''it is ratings like this that gives tripadvisor a bad name. i stayed a night here and it was perfectly ok for what it is. staff were perfectly nice and i got an upgrade from my 160 double room. but there was nothing to distinguish this from any one of numerous central london modern-ish 4 star hotels i stay in on a regular basis. it was a touch above the kwest, for example, but only because the kwest needs a bit of an overhaul, but still is 50 a night cheaper and is arguably in a nicer part of town. but what kills the apex is the lack of any parking at all - not even a decent guests' rate with the local ncp - ten minutes' walk away. to rate it in the top 25 in the uk is a bad joke.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''hotel is ok, room is ok, very clean, ratio price quality is well respected, location is great but - come on - how can you privatize the rooftop bar on a saturday without warning your customers ? | that was one of the great factors why we chose this hotel, the great view from the rooftop. | we came back earlier from our visits on saturday specially to enjoy a coktail on the terrace but it was privatized for a teenagers party ! | i mentioned this trouble at the reception and they all totaly understood the fact that i was unhappy but they said they could not do anything with the strategy of the hotel. | i think that the hotel should have at least offered a drink to the customers at the ground floor bar (even if it is not the same at all...) but in our case there was no effort at all so this experience takes off 1 star. | sorry for that but there was a serious lack of communication with your customers ! | next time, please warn your customers before they book so that there is no bad surprise...'''",1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''my husband and i stayed at the hotel xenia recently.we booked an executive double room. the staff on the desk were efficient but fairly unfriendly, although the porters were very pleasant. the room was well decorated, clean but oh so small!! the bed took up half the room and the walking space around it was minimal. there were little touches which i suppose tried to justify the executive tag, like bath robes provided and slippers, a tablet with info on and a pod coffee machine. the little en-suite was exquisitely beautiful with rain shower and lovely quality toiletries but it was like a broom cupboard in size. it was honestly difficult to turn around in there!! there was a little balcony which was decked with some chairs to sit on which i liked a lot. the public rooms were also tastefully styled and it was very clean throughout. the breakfast served in the restaurant was average. our waitress was very polite and friendly but no one gave us instructions so we did not know whether to help ourselves or to wait. we ordered some coffee but no one took our breakfast order for at least five minutes. the food was fine when it arrived but the quality of the sausages could have been better. my verdict on our stay here was average because although the setting and location were good, the size of the rooms (although well styled) were just too small.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this is the 3rd time we have stayed at this hotel. we booked an upgraded room as the regular rooms can be small. this is the first time we actually got windows on the outside of the building and it does make a big difference when you have sun light! the room was very clean but i found the bed hard and the pillows not comfortable. we also found the room hot at night despite the air conditioning which my husband maintains is turned off in all hotels in europe at night. you just get a thick duvet and no sheet so if you are hot the duvet comes off but you have nothing to cover yourself with. we also found the room very noisy which i have not encountered in other years. i could hear the people above us get up and use the toilet at night, could hear clearly conversations in adjoining rooms ( someone got in a lot of trouble for spending to much money at harrod's!!) but the worse was at 6 am when the couple in the next room called up a family member and sang happy birthday at the top of their lungs. it is a convenient location, close to the underground and right across from the victoria and albert museum. also just 3 blocks away from harrods. the area seems to be getting better restaurants if you take some of the side streets. breakfast was okay. they only give an urn of coffee which only gives about one mug per person. the elevators remain very slow. at least there is access to the piccadilly line that will bring you straight to the airport but there are some stairs involved with heavy suitcases. this is our hotel of choice in london but i am not sure if we will stay there next year. while i know london is very expensive, i think the hotel now is overpriced.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we stayed one night on a saturday, knowing that the city is mostly empty at the weekend. the hotel itself seemed very quiet, but staff were friendly and professional. the room (205) was good, but was somewhat noisy, both from traffic (almost exclusively taxis) and plumbing noises from other rooms. if you can, ask for a room away from the street. overall, a nice hotel, but the search for a truly quiet london hotel continues..!'''",1

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i visit london very often and always stay in little family run places like this. i used to stay at the nearby st. margaret's hotel but it has since moved so i thought i would try this one based on the tripadvisor reviews. i have to say i was disappointed, compared to other budget hotels in bloomsbury. | pros: i cannot complain about the price. gbp 45 per night is an outstanding rate for central london. location is great, 3 minute walk to goodge street tube station, 8 minute walk to british museum. rooms were clean. staff was friendly and helpful. | cons: breakfast was skimpy. only choice was between the egg dish of the day and cold cereal. again it was cheap, so cannot complain too much but st. margaret's hotel had several choices and bigger portions. shared bathroom is not a problem for me but these were particularly small. could not step out of the shower and dry off without hitting the walls. and the fact that it is cheap means you will be sharing the hotel with a lot of kids, which makes getting time on the (free) computer difficult. | summary: worth the money, but only because it is so cheap. next time i will spend a few more pounds and stay somewhere just one rung up the quality ladder.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''this well located hotel boasts good transport links...especially convenient for bus link to south kensington museums and knightsbridge shops. excellent housekeeping and friendly staff throughout. however my single room was essentially a narrow corridor with little space to move around...quite claustrophobic in fact. i tried to move room but the staff could not help. there is no bedside table and lighting in the bathroom was poorly positioned, making it difficult to see oneself in the mirror! bed was comfortable but very narrow corridors outside, with lots of noisy banging doors, made for an uneasy sleep at times.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we had a lovely stay at the rembrandt. as others have pointed out, the rooms are immaculately clean and well-appointed, the spread at breakfast was very impressive (we could use more of this type of thing in the states!), and the location could not be beat. such easy access to the rest of the city, close to victoria and albert, and saatchi galleries. there was also a lovely pedestrian area right outside the tube station where we found excellent restaurants and an adorable bookstore. | the only reason my rating is not higher is the fact that we sometimes felt nickeled-and-dimed, and were given inconsistent rates on things 2x. one night we went to the restaurant for a snack and requested tap water. when we got our bill we were charged four pounds for bottled water. also, our first day at breakfast there was no charge for iced tea, and our second day there was an inexplicable extra fee for this? we were a bit confused and taken aback by both instances. | it might be good for hotel staff to be on the same page about what is/is not included in the overall package. | would otherwise recommend the hotel to others!'''",1

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we have visited this hotel 3 times and 1 other within the hotel chain but we felt this visit was weak good but not excellent which is normally the case without a second thought. | i booked a superior double room , we arrived in the room, clean and tidy,a small balcony but what was disappointing the bathroom it was a bath which was surrounded by 3 walls not a free-standing bath as shown on the website photos.i am a huge bath lover and the thought of a long luxurious soak in a heavenly bath was just what i needed after a long day.i contacted reception explained my disappointment i was told that is not a standard feature of this room and should be requested.this is extremely misleading on the website.reception did find us a new room and moved us to one with a luxurious bath.the next frustration no key for the balcony so more contact with reception and after a 10/15 minute wait a key was brought up. | i requested a bowl of strawberries and milk for my tea by email the week before.i checked with reception on arrival, he said my requests are in my room.on arrival in the room no sign of my requests when i phoned down to reception he said they would be up once we were in our room, if he had said that when i checked that my requests had been carried out .i would not have phoned down. when they arrived the strawberries we beautifully presented in a cocktail glass but the milk for my tea was hot milk in a glass....??? this was replaced with cold milk in a jug. | why were been charged 5 for the milk and strawberries when we were given a 10 reward card to include in room dining.yet another thing to chase up with hotel reception | after from returning from an evening out we are normally greeted with goodbyes and hello's and often the main hotel door is opened, nothing this time, we returned to our room,the door card did not worked.....yet another contact with reception. | prior to sleeping the room was very warm so we removed the duvet and just slept with the cover woke at 2.30 very hot, tried to ignore it , then 30 minutes later i struggled in the dark to find how to control the temperature guide to lower it and increase the fan, another 30 minutes passed still no cool air i now woke my husband we ended up opening the balcony door , by 4am i went back to sleep.......very frustrating. | its such a shame as we normally have an excellent stay at the hotel, the room, reception, | breakfast etc.i have now come away disappointed and flattened and unsure if i would want to return and normally the experience is exceptional and any minor issues as ironed out immediately.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we entered the front door to find stacks of plasterboard in the hallway and to get to our room we had to squeeze past a mattress propped up against the wall (which was partly blocking the fire escape route). the room was clean and the bed was comfortable enough, although it seemed to be a small double rather than a full size one. the bathroom was newly tiled and fitted out, although it had the look of a diy refit rather than a professional one. overall an acceptable hotel for a cheap overnight stay, but i think you would be unhappy if you were staying here for a holiday.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i have stayed in morgan's properties before and was really excited about a stay at the mondrian as i have wanted to stay there since it opened so perhaps my expectations were a bit high but having now stayed there i do not feel the need to go back. | check in was easy and we had a lovely girl who looked after us there and gave us a very nice and much appreciated gift to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. our room was also really lovely and if this was our first stay at a morgan then i would probably give a 5* review based on this alone... but at their other hotels they offer a turn-down which we did not get here and we were especially disappointed with the breakfast service - the toaster was not working and nobody seemed able to sort it, and the buffet was just very 'standard' with no premium options on offer similar to the room service breakfast menu... we also found the breakfast team somewhat non-interested compared to our experience in the restaurant at dinner the previous evening. | all in all we enjoyed our stay and would be happy to recommend the mondrian but we are used to attention to detail from morgan hotels and on this occasion while detail was not missed entirely, there were a few minor things missing which i think could have been avoided... perhaps since sbe have taken over they are now cutting a few corners?... not sure, but i am sticking with st martin's lane or the sanderson next time i am in london and hopefully things have not slipped there!'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''we stayed at the dorchester (my wife for vacation, me on business) for four nights in 2011. although the hotel's reputation as a place to be seen is well deserved (it is indeed filled with a very well-heeled clientele), we found the room to be disappointingly small and dated. it may have been updated in the interim, but it was not up to par with similar properties at which we have stayed in other cities.'''",1

Rhodes Hotel,"'''i stayed at rhodes hotel for 2 nights just this past weekend while visiting london for the first time. it is conveniently located near both paddington and lancaster gate underground stations as well as several bus lines. the room was small but suitable and the bathroom was modern and clean. breakfast is croissants, toast, fruit, yogurt, pastries, and cereals. english breakfast is an additional 6 pounds. while my actual stay was fine, i wish i could give this place 5 stars but i simply cannot because my check in experience was miserable. | i arrived around 11:30am and proceeded to check in and pay my balance (booked through expedia and the hotel charged the first night as a deposit). the receptionist asked if i wanted to pay in my local currency which was usd. i promptly said no, knowing that they would charge their own conversion fee and make money off the transaction. getting ahead of himself and probably expecting me to be an idiot traveler and say yes, he charged my card in usd. i was not happy and in turn he voided the transaction, then charged me again in gbp. i was pretty annoyed because the voided funds were immediately debited from my account and no longer available which is a huge financial inconvenience. the receptionist was not very apologetic and seemed rather nonchalant about it. it was no big deal to him because it was not his money. now, 5 days later, the funds are still unavailable and have not been returned to my account. i am still traveling and would really like that money! very inconvenient and should have never happened in the first place. i will dispute the charge with my us bank if it is not credited back by end of the week. my second grievance with check in is a bit more minor but again did not leave a positive impression on me. i waited for about 45min for the room to become available and when it finally was, i proceeded to gather my things and head up. i was told by the same guy who incorrectly charged me that he would bring my backpack up. there is no lift and it is several flights. i say fine and head up to my room. i am waiting for about 15min in the room for my things before i just say screw it then i head downstairs. this guy is still chatting with the same woman he had been chatting with and having a personal conversation with while i sat in the lobby waiting. complete disregard for my bag he said he would bring up. that was not priority. mind you, no one else was checking in at that time and i was the only person waiting in the lobby for a room. as soon as he saw me ""oh, i am sorry"". i say forget it, i am trying to shower and go sightseeing, i will take my own bag, i do not have time wait on you. | basically, if you do not mind subpar customer service and the chance that you will be charged twice, by all means stay at rhodes. i liked the room and location but customer service is equally as important to me and the fact that i stayed there 5 days ago and still show two charges on my account is unacceptable. i would caution travelers to make it a point and be explicit early on about the currency to be charged in. if charged in your local currency it will cost more. i will not be staying at rhodes again the next time i find myself in london. there are many other hotels on the same block that seem to be comporable.'''",1
The Lanesborough,"'''we stayed in two rooms for two nights over the holiday season. this was my christmas gift- a stay at a fancy hotel with superior service. superior service- this is true and not true all at the same time. there were a number of hiccups during our stay, including an initial room that was smoke filled, a wrong room type given to us, a long wait for our rooms to be ready to begin with, cold food served in the bar, an inaccurate bar bill, and my girls being given a stare down when they came back to the hotel by themselves ahead of us by 5 minutes one evening making them very uncomfortable. most of these issues were handled very well and to our complete satisfaction (all but the girls being made to feel uncomfortable). the staff really worked to make everything right, so that was good, and we appreciated it greatly. i am just left thinking that for a brief stay, there were too many hiccups. for a 5-star hotel we should not have experienced some of the things we experienced. it is great that things were made right, but for the money we spent, i simply wish it had been much smoother. my girls will not stay again. the incident they experienced left them not liking this hotel, unfortunately. as for us, it will be a nice memory, but it was not relaxing and as special as it should have been.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''i tryed the hotel again after many years to check the renovation made. actually it is still going on which causes some problems to the operation and the well being of the guests. however what is worth noting is that the staff is very well trained and they handle issues that occur in a very professional manner. generally the staff is very polite and keen to assist. the company has a system of quite a lot duty managers that are around the clock present and that makes service more personalized. with regard public restaurants and areas all are very nicely done as far as the rooms i personally did not like the design and with a lot of functional mistakes but this is all a matter of a personal taste. bottom line i might check in again to the hotel because of the satisfaction i had from the staff service.''',1

The Savoy,"'''i booked five nights at the savoy for my parents, who were celebrating their anniversary. they typically stay at the ritz when in london, but as i adore having drinks at the savoy and find the refurbished dcor extremely beautiful, i persuaded them to try the savoy instead. i had fully expected it to be my favourite hotel in london; regrettably, though the style is indeed stunning and the bars second to none, i was saddened to discover the service they received hardly worthy of five-star status, let alone a name as illustrious as the savoys. | | the savoy betrayed from the beginning a surprising lack of attention to the small nuances that make a truly world-class hotel. though my parents were celebrating their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary and i had mentioned this before they arrived, this went completely unnoticed by the staff. the five-star hotels they had stayed at in france prior to arriving in london had both upgraded their room and provided champagne and flowers; though one cannot expect such generosity as a matter of course, one would expect at least a welcome note, or a nod from reception at check-in to acknowledge the occasion and wish them all the best. instead, they received not the merest mention of the occasion--perhaps far from an irremediable sin, but nonetheless surprising given that i have received better, more welcoming service from far smaller, less grand hotels. | | if that marked a disappointing beginning, the true nadir of service was that provided by a member of their concierge called david. the mans disposition was chilly at best, never betraying any hint of welcome or service. and at worst he was appallingly rude to my mother, something that is inexcusable at a five-star hotel. when she mentioned a restaurant she had enjoyed in soho the evening before, he had the nerve to reply by saying distastefully, oh, soho is the red light district in london, filled with gays and sex shops. | | now, i would argue this is not an appropriate way for anyone to speak to a middle-aged woman, let alone a five-star concierge. yet it further betrays a pretty shocking amount of bigotry and lack of knowledge. the restaurant we went to was michelin-starred; the food and service is exquisite. if he could not bring himself to be polite, he ought at least to have known that. moreover, it was a ten minute walk from the hotel. i hate to think what it says about the savoy if a mere ten minutes walk brings its guest to what is apparently a den of iniquity best to be avoided. | | moreover, my mother was not asking for general advice about soho or his opinion of the area. if this man is a bigot and prefers to stay away from areas that feature some gay bars and pubs, that is his prerogative (though might be inconvenient considering the biggest gay club in london is just down the street from the savoy)yet he ought also to recognise that soho is a thriving place filled with every sort of bar and restaurant, and not force his own prejudices on his guests. it seems common sense to me that though some guests might not like soho, others might enjoy a michelin-starred meal in a generally vibrant part of town that is a short walk from the hotel. never mind the fact that surely some guests at the savoy happen to be gay, in which case dismissing an entire part of the city due to the presence of some gay establishments is rather abominable in my view, particularly in this day and age. | | to denigrate my mother and a dinner she had genuinely enjoyed in this fashion was extremely offensiveit clearly upset my mother, who had only been trying to express she had enjoyed a nice evening, and had certainly not expected to be made to feel embarrassed over it. | | i have never encountered such flagrantly rude service from staff at any hotel in which i have been a guest. to encounter it at the savoy is simply insane, and speaks most eloquently as to why my parents left feeling deeply ambivalent about the place, and why it is unlikely they will be returning despite the hotels beauty and good location. | | though it was the offensiveness of david the concierge that most deeply upset us, it is also worth noting that there were several problems with the room as well, ranging from large black scuff marks on the wall and ceiling (please see the attached photos), an electrical outlet that did not work, and a mirror in the bathroom that was broken when my parents arrived and then broken again by the maid after the hotel had sent someone to fix it. though to their credit the hotel did eventually move to address these problemsthough not by moving my parents to a different room; i should note that they gave me assurances they would do this, and then never followed through on it, another indefensible failing from a hotel of this classnone of this is indicative of a true five-star hotel. though these details might otherwise have merited overlooking, coupled with the outright offensive service received from david, they speak to serious problems inherent in the hotel. | | ultimately, the savoy is five-star in beauty, style, and atmosphere, yet two or three star for service. this is inexcusable at this price range. having said that, i should mention that their doormen and the staff in their bars and restaurants were absolutely faultless, and thankfully saved the experience for my parents to some degree. in the bars and restaurants, one finds staff who are impeccably trained, courteous, and wonderful. and there were other members of their reception and concierge who were very polite and helpful. if only every member of the hotel staff offered service of a similar quality. | | for service to equal the name, i would recommend potential guests try the ritz or claridge's, hotels which offer truly exemplary service to match their elegant surroundings. for the savoy, do stop in to try the excellent barsamongst the best in londonor the superb savoy grill. then seek accommodation elsewhere.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''have wanted to stay here for a while,driving past the building all the time it is a beautiful building.as said on here before it is quite dark inside,and some rooms are small compared to other london hotels,and for the price of the room would like to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room without having to pay on top'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''arrival | we arrived and the staff were welcoming, however, they decided that for some reason at this hotel they needed to take payment of the stay upfront, rather than upon checkout. i said ok, but they also wanted to take another 30 incase i used anything from the minibar. i declined and said i would rather pay for what i use as i use it, which they were fine with. the first problem occurred because their card machine would not work, so i spent 10 minutes waiting for their system to let me pay. | i asked if everything would be ready for the room as i had paid extra for a romantic package of prosecco on ice in the room, accompanied by a box of chocolates and rose petals. also i was told upon booking that they would have a card saying happy birthday to my fiancee (who is name i gave and spelled out over the phone). they said everything was ready so we went up to the room. | the room | initial impressions of the superior double room, were that it was very nice and clean. the bathroom which i had requested to have a freestanding bath was lovely, one of the nicest bathrooms i have seen in a hotel (apart from the arch which had a tv in the bath with a rain shower above). | unfortunately once getting out of the bath, i noticed there was dry, chipped paint coming off from above the bath, which kind of ruined how nice it was. again, not worth 281 per night. | the tv was a large screen lcd, unfortunately quite old and with a poor picture. compared to the bang and olufsen tv at the south place hotel only 5 mins walk away, this was very poor. the same thing applied to the bose iphone/ipod dock.....that only had an old apple 30 pin connection. they should be up to date enough to have lightning connection docks in 2015 since they have been around for at least 2 years now. this was another thing that made me regret paying 281 for the night. | there was as requested, a bottle of prosecco in an ice bucket, perfect....so i thought. unfortunately when my fiancee picked up her card off the bed, what was supposed to read dear chanel........happy birthday eat, read dear mr harrison! i specifically read out and spelled out her name over the phone when booking, but obviously the staff did not bother reading the notes about my reservation. the next thing was at the bottom of the card it said in broken english something about having a good day will!!!. my name is not will, and my fiancee's name is certainly not will. who is will??? i do not know. to finish off, there were also no rose petals. this was an extra package i paid for, and it was not complete. | i went to speak with the hotel reception and spoke to who i think may have been the manager. he was very nice, very apologetic and offered 2 free drinks at the bar. i did accept this, however i feel that the errors should really have not been allowed to happen, as my fiancee was quite upset and i was a little angry that i had tried to make things nice for her and unfortunately relied on this hotel to arrange things, yet, they had not done what was asked, and paid for. | the bar | the bar staff were excellent, very friendly, exceptionally helpful, but unfortunately cannot make good cocktails. i have had cocktails all over the world and at many hotels in london, but the drinks at off the wall were not good. rather than make a fuss and complain, we let it slide and gave them another chance, but the cocktails were just not good at all, worst were the mojito's which were watery, with no sugar at all, too much lime and far too much mint (leaves). every mojito i have ever drunk has had brown sugar at the bottom, which takes away the bitter and sour tastes of some of the alcohol but most importantly the lime. there was no sugar and any of the at least 3-4 mojito's we drank there. | the restaurant | breakfast | the breakfast was not bad, full english. it was a fair size although i have had better portions. the bacon was terrible, like plastic and impossible to cut, as well as being completely tasteless. the poached eggs were fine, beans were nice and black pudding was not bad. | i also had a pan au chocolate which was very nice, it was warm and the chocolate was melting inside. my fiancee had a fruit selection plate, which was also very good, lots of fruit that seemed fresh. | dinner | after checking out and spending the day in london shopping, we returned to collect our bags, but decided to get something to eat as we were so hungry. we decided to eat at the restaurant in the hotel. we had the set menu which included a glass of wine (red or white), and a starter, main and desert. all the food was very, very good. delicious and good portions. well worth the 25 per person charge. i just wish the room had been worth the 281 i paid. | other points | i am allergic to feather pillows, so asked to have something else (despite not being asked as i checked in). they told me they would sort something out, so about 45 mins to an hour later someone knocked at the door. the guy was very apologetic that they only had a small square pillow in the entire hotel that was not feather!!! really????? | at other hotels upon arrival and check in i am often asked what sort of pillows i would like and most hotel i stay in offer a memory foam pillow (to accompany a memory foam mattress), but not the london wall hotel obviously. | ultimately i quite regret booking the hotel and paying the 281 for the night. i do not feel it was worth it at all and would really like to get some money back as i thought overall the room and stay was worth no more than 80 or so. if they updated the tv, repainted the bathroom, put a new bose dock in the room, had memory foam mattresses and pillows, and also read the notes on their system, i would have been happy to pay the 281.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''went here the other day...was pleasant but somehow i left dissappointed. probably because the menu was not very enticing for lunch. i was looking for something more interesting. will need to give it another go and probably not the right place to choose burger and chips and i will make a concious effort in requesting help from the staff next time.''',1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''stayed here for one night with a colleague while working in the area.overall i would recommend the place but i must give it a few minuses.the room was spotless but very small, as was the bathroom, both were modern and well decorated.when i checked in i was marched about 200 yards around the corner to the""annex"".this meant a march back the next morning for breakfast,,to me this was no more than inconvenient, but for some this could be a problem.breakfast was continental with little choice and an extra charge for full english.i would not tell anyone not to stay here as it is comfortable,but it could be better.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''this hotel is absolutely overrated. check in and concierge services were mediocre at best. apart from its location, the only redeeming feature was the good food at kaspar's and the wonderful service from the wait staff in that restaurant. the savoy does not hold a candle to the plaza new york or even the fairmont san francisco. absolute waste of good money.'''",1

Newham Hotel,"'''good bits, secure parking, our room was warm but corridors freezing. room was clean but did smell a bit of cigarettes. bedding thin but ok. tv and tea/coffee in room. bathroom clean and lots of hot water. breakfast starts early during the week 6.30am as their main clientele are tradespeople. choice is basic but there are cereals, fruit juice, cooked options (eggs were very very overcooked, mushrooms are tinned as is the fruit salad, other items good). also tea/coffee and toast. | decor rather drab although there has been some refurb (e.g. newish carpets). overall everything is budget but for the price its good value. the area is pretty drab but there is an excellent chinese restaurant just down the road. reception service is mixed the guy on when we arrived was helpful, the one on later was rude, the young lady the next morning was lovely.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''it is an institution of course, with a mythical address (the strand) and the only street in the uk with traffic on the right side of the street. thames river views from the meeting rooms at the back (once you have managed to find them, quite a labyrinth with stairs up and down etc.) are very nice, i suppose some of the posher rooms might have these as well ? i certainly did not, my room looked out on a very small inner courtyard, had a very old and cold feeling marble bathroom, and rather depressing light in the decent sized room. a bit too old, grim and dusty for me. wellness with swimming pool and sauna was very nice and open &amp; heated up for an early morning sweat session = always pleasant. | in london i prefer the less posh but more modern 5 star hotels like grange tower bridge or m by montcalm shoreditch as a lot cheaper alternatives. if you want to stay in the posh and expensive category the savoy is in, check out a boutique alternative like the arch hotel, or my london favorite the rosewood : better situated, better service, very nice meeting rooms, much more modern lay-out and decoration, larger rooms and very efficient yet pleasant light arrangements, in corridors as well as in the rooms'''",1

London Guest House,"'''the staff are really nice and helpful, the rooms and en-suite are clean, beds ok. the room rates are reasonable by london standards. however, there is no cooked breakfast, only toast, fruit and cereals, the quality of which is cheap. you are about 15 minutes walk from various tube stations and 10 minutes from a choice of restaurants. there are shops such as a chemist and convenience stores opposite.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''hotel was good but i am not sure it warrants so many 5 star reviews. | stayed in lots of london hotels and used the mondrian a few times for meetings. | restaurants and bars are good but the room let us it down a little!''',1
The Savoy,"'''we visited london for a two-day family break and decided to stay at the savoy. obviously we were very excited about this and were prepared for a once in a lifetime experience. when we drove up to the hotel there were lots of staff there to greet us and we were whisked to our room where the check-in paperwork was completed. we were in one of the art deco style rooms which was very comfortable and beautifully decorated. our 9 year old had a small single bed made up for him which did take up quite a lot of the room. the bathroom was large and extremely satisfactory. once we had a chance to gather ourselves we decided to venture to the bar for a drink and to enjoy the ambience. however we were told that at 4.30 the bar was full and children were not allowed in it anyway. we said we just wanted to have a sit down and relax after wandering around london for most of the day. however the only place that was offered was the american bar, where you had to stand up, which was not acceptable to us. so we ended up having to leave the hotel and find somewhere else to enjoy a drink. we dined in covent garden and then came back to the hotel and straight to the room. then in the morning i inquired with reception if breakfast was included to be told that it would cost us 75 for the three of us to have breakfast. so again we ate out of the hotel. so really i was left disappointed with our stay as we did not feel we had a chance to soak up the ambience of the place. yes the service was faultless and overall the hotel was suitably grand but for our one night stay i would not say it was somewhere i would recommend for family in our situation.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the hotel was comfortable. the location cannot be beat. the room was clean. the breakfast buffet was amazingly generous. it had several varieties of breads, croissants, yogurts, salads and you could have all of the juice you want. i will tell people who do stay to be diligent about putting the ""do not disturb"" sign on your door. housekeeping twice walked into my room without knocking or knocking too quietly. when i told the front desk, they were very responsive and said they would mention this to housekeeping. i am a fitness fanatic. the gym is quite small indeed, so it was a bit of a trick to find floor space for my free weight workout. the gym is not well ventilated. i was not aware of the charge for each use of the gym. i was a bit disappointed by that. i think the hotel is a bit expensive. all in all, i was not entirely excited about the experience, but it was a satisfactory stay.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i have to say that i was thoroughly disappointed in my stay at the savoy. perhaps i have grown spoiled, and obviously it is a quality establishment, however, when compared to its peers, i find it sadly lacking. firstly, it was not up to standard, and could have really benefitted from a more keenly attentive maintenance crew. secondly, i have rarely come across such rude staff. the attitude was so appalling, i could scarcely credit it. in general i felt like they were condescending to cater to my needs at check in and check out. | i live in london but i stayed after my 40th birthday party. as i had missed dinner i ordered room service which was fairly expensive at 27 pounds for a frozen pizza, but understandable for the level of the hotel. admittedly, a pizza is an odd choice at such an establishment, but at least i would have expected it to be delicious. i have no doubt it was quite simply a frozen pizza of the most mediocre variety. it was so bad, i cancelled my room service breakfast order (47pounds and a record price in my experience). | in the morning, due to a demonstration, fleet street was closed and i was told they would not even try to find me a cab and i should take the underground. i had to find one myself. having had the blessing of staying in many 5 star hotels over the years (four seasons, shangrila', armani hotel in dubai, kepinski, mandarin oriental, to name a few), i can say that i shall not be repeating this experience and will look unfavourably on the chain. | go somewhere else!'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''having read the glowing reports on trip advisor i booked this hotel with great expectations, my daughter and i had not seen each other for 7months and i had imagined a weekend of luxury, what we got was a ""nice"" hotel with nice staff..nothing fantastic sadly, the bath i had imagined floating in was not to be, twin rooms are the same as handicapped rooms, and wonderful as it is to have so many handicapped rooms, a twin room, that looks out to nothing but frosted windows, and a very average bathroom, was a disappointment, no upgrade was offered on checkin, (although i am gold expedia member) staff were very nice, but then again, i am not looking at the staff to give me a great london experience, the hotel is perfect for the business men that seem to enjoy staying here during the week, but this area is so quiet on the weekend a period movie was being shot around the corner on a sunday and not a soul was in sight to see it...breakfast was excellant, fast and nicely presented. i would not recommend this hotel if you are after a great weekend break, unless you just need to sleep all weekend.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we booked a stay here for valentines. having stayed in many 5* places we were expecting to be blown away to a whole new level at the savoy but were very much underwhelmed. we still had a fantastic time as it was just nice to have a night away, but it was far from seamless. | were impressed by the check in (or more accurately not having to check in) as the valet took our bags and car and by the time we would gone through the doors someone was there to greet us and knew our names and took us up to our room. this was pretty much it in terms of seeing great service. | needless to say, lobby/restaurants/bars/main areas all beautiful. | bags took a long time to come up and i needed some things for going to dinner so held us up a bit, sent them up shortly after i called to chase. not a big deal though would have been nice to have had time for a drink before dinner at the bar as we would planned and also made us late for dinner which did not help the sequence of events that followed. | had dinner at kaspar's which was a set menu for the evening (including aperitif of theophile, not a fan). had a nice wine recommended by the sommelier. the seafood dishes were wonderful, really good oysters and fruits de mer and a dover sole main. the non-seafood plates were not very nice, if i was to dine at kaspar's again i would steer away from non-fish dishes. service started off really well, however after the main we seemed to become invisible and it took a very long time to get through dessert and the bill. we saw all the other tables have a series of treats and special valentines things like chocolates and flowers and little shots after dessert but i think because it was so late by the time they got round to serving us (most of the restaurant had been packed away) we did not get any of this and we were sat waiting a long time to leave. it did not really matter that we did not get the extras as we would had plenty to eat, it was just the novelty value that would have been fun and it was poor form considering we would spent close to 500 on dinner. | after dinner we had a reservation at the beaufort bar for live music and drinks but they would made our reservation at the same time as our dinner reservation rather than after (even though i had confirmed this by email) so they thought we were a no show and did not keep a table for us and we were told they were full. were eventually given a table with a view of the back of the band. had a quick nightcap and left. | room was ok, quite worn and dated, carpet quite grim, but very comfortable bed and linens so slept very well. tv did not work, no biggie. bose dock is for the old iphones so would be good with an adaptor. nice selection of champagne/drinks/snacks in the mini bar. bathroom had a nasty discoloured rubber slipmat in the tub and when i pulled this out there was some yucky yellowy water under there so decided against using tub. supplies very basic indeed, needed some sanitary items which i called down for and they got so i was very grateful for that. i did not like that they just had some loose cotton pads and buds shoved in the toiletries stand, have actually never seen these loose in any hotel before. called for some paracetamol the next day and was made out to be a really big deal (they would need to send someone to tesco etc. etc. so just said to forget it). in general something which i also noticed prior to arriving when making arrangements was that they seem to have some moronic phone operators who do not have much training and i was quite surprised by some of the things they say, so do not really get why they let people who are not trained adequately to handle guest calls. prior to arriving i was checking about our reservations and their 'operator' told me to call kaspar's and check myself! not the service attitude you would expect from such an institution. nice fit bathrobes but not available to buy and take away (need to order online). | had breakfast in the thames foyer. had ridiculously high seats for the table and swapping muffins for rye toast seemed to because a massive complication, eventually got my breakfast after my partner's and got my toast so long after that the food was cold, and poached eggs solid/butter solid (my pet hate, same in kaspar's) - way too much effort when you just want an easy breakfast. the tongs were like stiff exercise grip contraptions, could not pick anything up, just made me laugh (also had this in kaspar's). | had some spa treatments, they were quite nice, but would not return for. also spa colour scheme is quite crazy and garish so not somewhere i would want to spend any time trying to relax around the pool. also noticed later that double charged our treatments on both room bill and spa bill (which i am now trying to get sorted out). | buying some stuff from the tea shop on the way out was exhausting, so many rules around pastries (cannot combine this with this, got to buy 8 of that, cannot have one of those, not enough left to sell a set blah blah). macaroons were pretty bad, very sugary and very dry. nice choc dipped strawberries, worth noting as a good place to pick these up in future. | took ages to get our car (because a road was closed so completely not their fault), concierge guys were very sweet and kept updating us and offered us drinks. check-out/express check-out very convenient. | a bit inelegant to add 3 newspapers to the room bill as an extra, is this really necessary? never seen this anywhere before. made me laugh. they should just increase room rate to price in newspapers so you might actually feel like a guest rather than a customer if they really need the 3, feel this hotel is confused between very us style sales/business orientation (but not there in terms of can-do service and everything being for sale) and more gb classic discreet elegant service. lacked attention to detail. other good hotels are stepping up their game so much it is just not enough to fall back on an old name anymore, savoy need to pull their socks up, they seem to be riding on the prestige of their history. also made us laugh that they charge wifi (unless you are in registered in fairmont club), even starbucks and the tube have free wifi, this is 2014! unfortunately will not be recommending/returning to stay.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''the way the front desk person treated me knocked off the fourth star. i would not expect that from a hotel of this quality. keep reading for details. | this is a boutique hotel. it is very nicely appointed, but it is very small. the hallways are narrow. the elevators are small. the rooms are small. the bathrooms are small. i do not recommend this hotel if you have children or a lot of luggage. it is halfway between two tube stops (earls court and gloucester), otherwise it is sort of off the beaten path. | maybe it is because we booked online through booking.com that we were given the smallest room ever! literally when we opened the door, it brushed the side of the queen size bed. we had to do quite a lot of maneuvering to get a second person in the room and open the door to the bathroom. (i think the strategy would have been to keep one person on the bed at all times.) there was no room for our luggage. | when i returned to the front desk to request a larger room, the man ""helping"" me suggested my luggage was too big...we were reluctantly assigned a larger room for an additional 30 per night. (when we checked out, the same man was worried that we were leaving without paying our bill. he was rude. i cannot remember the last time i was so insulted!) | our second room was bigger, although not quite as plush as the tiny one. still no luggage rack. no drawers (except two in the desk and a tiny one in each tiny nightstand). our luggage sat on the small couch. there is no counter in the bathroom, only a small glass shelf above the small sink. when i rinsed my face, i made a puddle on the floor. there was no room for any toiletries. | what is nice about xenia? for starters the bellman (thanks szilard!) was extremely friendly and accommodating. our first tiny room was beautiful. the bed was beautifully appointed. our second room is not quite as nice, but at least there is room for two of us to move around. the bath products are by l'occitane. there is an espresso machine (but once again the room is so small all the accoutrements are on a tray on a shelf in the closet).there is a towel bar warmer in the bathroom. two adapter outlets were on the desk. | there is a nice bar on the first floor and a cozy lobby. | they seemed to make the most of the tiny spaces they had. my priorities (drawers, luggage rack, space for toiletries) were different then theirs (sofa, espresso machine, towel warmer). there is no right or wrong here, just not a good match.'''",1

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''first, the good! | the hotel is very centrally located, just across the street from the embankment tube station and within easy walking distance to the london eye,

into the lobby to the second you get to your room. simply beautiful everywhere you look. | the doormen always open the door for you and greet you with a warm smile | the concierge was most helpful and friendly | where the hotel fails is the service. and it fails miserably. i have given this review long and hard thought because i really, really wanted to love the corinthia. but i strongly feel that part of an exceptional vacation is a fantastic hotel stay. sadly we did not have a great hotel stay. we were there for 6 nights, so i believe we got a good feel for the hotel. | where the service failed us follows (i am going to highlight just a few things as the list would be too long to publish if i listed every failing we experienced): | upon arrival at the hotel (we were guaranteed in writing an 8:00am check-in by the reservation supervisor), we were told our room was not ready and would not be until after 3:00pm. i consider myself a reasonable person, but i was paying $1,300.00 a night and part of the reason i agreed to such a high price was so that i could rest after a cross atlantic flight. thank goodness i had the confirmation with me, otherwise we would have been out of luck as were told that the hotel was full and they had no room to give us. funny enough they managed to find us an executive room (category we had booked) to ""rest"" in. i stated i wanted to keep the room as i loathe unpacking (toiletries, change of clothes, etc) and packing up again after a brief rest and shower, but was told other, more important clients had booked the room and we would have to vacate by noon. too exhausted to argue, we went to the room, could not locate a ""do not disturb"" sign to hang on the door and laid down. we were disturbed not once, not twice, but three times by incessant ringing of the door bell. finally the mini bar gentleman informed us that he would press a ""dnd"" button for us. how annoying when you are trying to sleep. | we had to pack the bags back up and vacate the room. we were told that we had been ""upgraded"" to a junior suite. even though i did not want it. it was very disappointing. the primary reason is that the closet was so tiny (the smallest we have ever experienced at any hotel in the world) that i could not even unpack one carry on, whereas the closet in the executive room had a full walk-in closet with many drawers, shelves, mirrors, racks to hang clothes on, etc. we had two tiny drawers (excl. the one the safe was in) and 8 or 10 hangars in our ""suite"". more hangars would not have helped as there was no room for more than that. there was no room for so much as a pair of shoes in the closet either. i cannot say enough how frustrating that closet was. we were there for six nights and i had to store the majority of our clothes in a suitcase (i will also mention that there was only room for 1 suitcase in the closet). i begged and begged for our ""executive"" room back but was told they had nothing else for us. i would have taken the smallest room at the hotel as long as it had a closet, but nothing was offered. nada. | the bathroom was lovely. the shower was beyond nice. it was exceptional. but ours only had 1 sink (unusual for a suite). that sink backed up during our entire stay. i had to ask 4 times to have it fixed. i am not sure if they were unable to fix it the first 3 times or it just took 4 calls for them to come to the room. i never got a straight answer. but i found it disgusting to have a sink that would fill to the top when you washed your hands and then take 10 minutes to drain. enough said. | the thermostat in our room was not working. it was set at 23.5c, but it was freezing. we were shivering in the room. i had to call 5 times to have it fixed. i was told repeatedly that there was nothing wrong with it. after the 5th call, we had it set at 21c for the remainder of the stay and we were comfortable. but it took 3 days to have it fixed. three days of extreme discomfort. | perhaps the most egregarious failing of the hotel was with regards to the locks on our balcony doors. we were on the 1st floor and had 2 doors that exited to the courtyard. there were approximately 10 or 12 other rooms with the same configuration that were reachable via the courtyard that we were facing. meaning we could easily walk from our patio to the one next door. on the second day, i went outside. i noticed (i had left the door open) that i was able to open the patio door from the outside as it did not seem to lock. alarmed, i immediately called reception. i was assured that the doors were self locking when closed and there was no problem. i asked if someone could come and check to be sure and was told they would. on the fourth day i was again on the patio and decided to try the other (second) door from the outside. it was unlocked. so i shut the first one and it too was unlocked from the outside. meaning anyone from the other 10 or 12 rooms could have, at any point, day or night, walked right into our room via the patio doors. when i called the front desk again, i was assured that i was wrong and the doors are self locking and that they had checked them. i told them this was not the case and to please fix the doors immediately. when we returned to the room, one of the doors was permanently locked (from the inside and outside) and the other now had a key in the lock. i was never offered an apology for putting my safety at risk. shame on the hotel for such an alarming oversight on guest safety. a backed up sink and broken thermostat, liveable (though not acceptable), but unlocked doors. not okay. ever. | for those traveling with families. beware that the pool does not allow children (yes, you are reading correctly). children are ""allowed"" to swim between 10am and 11:30am and 3:00pm to 4:30pm. hours that do not work when you are in london to tour the city. | there were many, many other failings in customer service, but i believe i have highlighted the significant ones. i really did want to love this hotel. it is so modern and gorgeous. but the customer service (or lack thereof) just took that feeling away from us. | would i recommend this hotel? hard to say (i hesitate here as the hotel did try, although too late, to remedy the situation for us). i am sure many, many people have amazing experiences here. it just did not happen for us.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''chose the hotel due to it is location to albert hall and stayed for two nights, the location is brilliant. | i booked an 'executive room' largely due to the photos shown in the internet and first impressions were disappointing. the room was very, very clean, but much smaller than the photos suggest, which also show large double windows whereas the room actually had a small window in the corner. as i said however, the room was clean and everything there one would need. | we ate in the bar prior to going to the albert hall and the food and service were very good. | the next morning however, breakfast was disappointing and not four star standard. tables in rows very close together, and unfortunatley we were next to two loudly speaking businessmen using the breakfast table as their office. i know this is not the hotel's fault but the tables are too close together. the food was well cooked but warm, not hot. then with only cold plates it was only luke warm when eaten. also, mugs instead of cups &amp; saucers are not usually used in a four star hotel. the staff again were friendly and helpful.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''the location of the hotel is great with a tube stations and buses close by. there were quite a few restuarants in the surrounding streets. the staff were all very helpful and i loved the personal service at breakfast. the room is probably in need of a facelift, but the bed was surprising comfortable. i loved the sitting room downstairs where there were computers available for guest use. the biggest problem for us was that the hotel had no lift and getting two large suitcases up and down three flights of stairs was very difficult. having said that, i would stay here again.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we just spent a weekend in london at the rembrandt. we fully agree with previous reviews rating the hotel at 3*. the bathrooms were outdated, bathroom door cranked on the lower edge,handwash top also crancked. grid covering the light above the hand wash was so dusty..the website mention hairdryier available. we could not see it in the bathroom, checked all drawers in the room and in the end asked the reception.they said : well, probably someone left with it, will bring you one. they did immediately - but for a 4 star hotel i can not understand how come they do not have the ones on the wall, that no one can take home. and they are more modern. | the hall carpets were a bit dusty and old, walls carrying marks and dents from heavy luggage dragged around. it could do with a fresh paint. | the breakfast is fine, ok selection for both continental and english breakfast. when you come to the dining room, you have to wait to be sitted. they write the room number and number of persons on a sheet of paper by the computer.why not directly on the computer ? | the location is great, 5 min walk from south kensington underground station.direct train from heathrow on picadilly line, cannot be easier. good eating and shopping options around. | we do not necesarily regret our choice, but we will choose another hotel next time.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''it met the needs of a clean bed, a hot shower, and good breakfast. the bed, though, was not so comfortable. as for location, once we figured out the short cut through the college on the next block over, it was easy to get to russell square, the tube- for several lines including picadilly to heathrow, and restraunts. in the other direction, googe&lt;?&gt; tube station was closer. the #24 bus stop across the street was easiest transportation method for us, though. #24 goes through the theater dist. and has a drop-off at westminster among others. coming back was a little trickier due to gower being a one-way. the staff were very accomdating, and had breakfast done up early for us on a day we all took a bus tour and needed to be at the pick up location - russel hotel - by 7:30 a.m.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this hotel has so much potential. the back end of the hotel with the sitting area, bars and restaurants is gorgeous. sitting on the river, i can not imagine a greater location for a london weekend. | let me first say that cam, the head concierge, is exceptional. he was the class act of the staff we encountered. | i checked in after a long flight, arriving at the hotel around 4:30. my room was not ready. this was a disappointing start. i was given a coupon for a drink in the bar but when your room is not ready after check in time, it is inexcusable. | the room was nice and comfortable. love the bathroom amenities. | i had a pair of cufflinks on my bedside table wrapped in tissue. the housekeeper inadvertently threw out my cuffs. it was an innocent mistake. i called the front desk that evening to see if they could assist or give a loaner pair for my sales calls in the morning. the front desk manager was helpful with the call but said i would receive a call the next morning with assistance. this call never came. no offer for a new pair of links, no free drink coupon, (this is a joke) this was disappointing and very sloppy. | i moved to my next hotel in london that morning. they immediately offered me cuff links until i could get my own. | sadly i would not stay here again.'''",1
A To Z Hotel,'''cheap accomodation in a not too far from the underground place. the room was very small but enough. it was very closed to the street therefor the level of noise was high.the advert indicated wifi but it did not reach to the third floor of the building. | ok for a short stay.''',1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i arrived at the corinthia after a short and bumpy flight with no sleep from new york. i was quickly escorted up to my room on the seventh floor. awakening after a short nab i started wondering how both me and my bag fitted into the room. with barely any space to navigate around the bed and way too many chairs and stuff than the cramped rrom should fit, it almost met the standrards set by the geneva convention, but certainly not the expectation for a place as pristine as this. | when asking the concierge for a shoeshine service i was then told someone would come up immediately. i guess they operate on a different time concept than most mortals since 6 hours aftre the call, my shoes were still untreated. certainly not the kind of service you would expect. | waiting for a friend in the lobby became an arctic experience as staf would continuously open the atrium door to the outdoor smoking section, to make sure everybody participated in the near freezing london november climate. when going there bring a coat, a smile and a courteous attitude, just what the staff was missing. | with expectations thus forcibly lowered, i found the following night myself waking up at 4am. turns out the neighboring room had started a late party and the incoming crowds could not use the doorbell because of the glaring loud music playing at this advanced hour. for three hours people kept banging on doors, reducing any chance of peaceful rest to tatters. | all in all: luxury hotel, for sure. but if you seek comfort, decent service and a good night's sleep, do not go here.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''this hotel was very old and not modernized for the most part. the bathroom was nice, but beds, rooms, etc. we are all quite dated. | for us, this was a low priced spot for a quick layover. | the staff was friendly and helpful and we were able to take a nice walk through hyde park that is near by and that was beautiful (beware the park closes at sundown and it is a long walk around the park).'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''the hotel is very nice and near the tower of london and its bridge. the staff are nice, as well and we found spanish people who helped us in a lot of things. | we had a bad experience while my boyfriend and i were having dinner. the presence of little and annoying mmosquitos during all dinner was disgusting. my boyfriend instead of having dinner he was trying to kill them. i do not know if the waiters could hear us clapping our hands like we were dancing ""sevillanas"". at the moment of paying, we asked for someone responsible and,first came the maitre and she told us that on monday some people will come to solve the problem. the manager on duty said that the entrance door was all day open and that was a reason that these little animals get into the hotel, jajaja. the las thing that could happen was the fly walking on our desserts. their reward to us was that we did not pay for the dinner. | a positive point was the breakfast served and the pastries were home-made, we recommend them.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''3pm check in means 3pm check in - not an attitude from reception because your room is not ready. i was here to look after my godson during his parents anniversary so we had requested rooms on the same floor. neither room was ready on time. fundamental part of good service from a hotel is making sure the rooms are ready. | no robes, no slippers, no shower caps unless requested. | room service was quite nice, ran out of one item asked for from the menu - because its 'sunday'. a fresh juice is 8 which seems extortionate. | nice rooms and comfy beds but if you are even slightly claustrophobic or like breathing in air, its not the place to stay. the most stuffy, unpleasant environment to spend a night. ac on is stuffy loud and dry, ac off is stuffy, boiling hot. i woke up feeling like i had a cold. friends had a suite with balcony overlooking the river which was very nice. | of course very touristy on a sunday in december so rather busy. generally a nice environment although i did not use the spa, just not impressed with check in or the lack of fresh air. gentleman on guest services line was a pleasure though - total contrast to the reception.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel definitely is not 4* hotel. i would give it solid 3*. our room looked very basic but comfortable. it was kind of outdated, no ac in the room. piping system is so old so you can hear your neighbors taking shower perfectly. but location is good, few minutes from the tube with direct line to heathrow airport and victoria station, across from museums and walking distance from hyde park and harrods.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''one of the grande dames of the london hotel scene, previously the haunt of old money, the elite of uk plc, the occasional celebrity in shades, and even prosperous families on a special treat trip up to london for the weekend. today the dorchester resembles (spiritually) nothing so much as the london outpost of the burj al-arab. of course the building's style remains, with its fabulous ott chintz and swagged luxury. but from the moment you arrive at the front door and see the row of gold spray-painted bugattis (with six-wheel drive bespoke suvs for the bodyguards) you will have no doubt about what the hotel has - sadly - become. | the dorchester has become the gold-tap capital of london. you will mix with billionaires from russia, the middle east and asia, and will come to relish the pastiche of british gentility now served up by the exquisitely trained staff. dining options are superb - although the somewhat hades-like china tang restaurant in the basement has come to offer a bland, unfortunately sanitized take on chinese food, which is a pity given the credentials of the team in the kitchen. | it is a difficult place to like. london offers many better hotels and even several more expensive, or with higher bling quotients. the dorchester finds itself trapped in a gilded, heartless, taste-free no-man's land.'''",1
The Dorchester,'''i have been going to dorchester for some time but i must say because of what happend i do not think i will be returning . | as we walk unto the premadd the waitress name aza i think an eastern european was very rude and refuse to give us a seat and told us to go by the bar and just seat when i was about to seat near the bar she came and shouted at us as if we where nothing and said i told you not to seat there . as we sat by the bar we waited for 20 min as we where ignored until i call a waiter and order an expensive bottle of champagne that is when they became really nice and attention ate when i asked to speak to the manager he came and try to tell me the waitress's was unabailabke as she went home but she was walking past him so i pointed to him and he was covered in shame . he apologise and the waitress came after being told off to apologise which i did not accept . dorchester do not just recruit anyone screen those people's properly because they are damaging your name and for this reason i prefere to spend my money elsewhere .''',1
The Dorchester,"'''we stayed for 1 night for a christmas event held at the hotel. the service was patchy with a lack of communication between departments. a request to put our luggage in our room and hang up a dress while we went out as the room was not ready when we arrived was agreed but did not happen. a change to the time of a tea booking was confirmed with the restaurant then we were rung up to ask where we were at the previous booked time. | the room was a bit tired, the bathroom window was not double glazed and it was very noisy, the sink plug did not fit. no tea or coffee in the room which given the cost was surprising. on the positive side the shower was great and the bed very comfortable. | overall it did not live up to its reputation and we would not choose it over many other great hotels in london.'''",1

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the only inspiring decision in selecting this hotel was the location where the proximity of the nearby museums and attractions are convenient. room size was small as expected, public areas was a little dated. service is typically cold and 'snobbish' which is unexpected given that this brand is an asian brand and one would expect at least a dose of friendly gestures or smiles.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''we were unfortunately in london during the great hot spell in early august. the location for the rembrandt is great, just a short walk from harrods with the subway and bus stops conveniently located. but, the hotel is not all air-conditioned and the first night we spent in a miserably hot room with just a circulating fan which just proved to be impossible for both myself and my husband.the next day we requested and was moved up to an air-conditioned room but the manager initially would not honor the rate we had been quoted when we reserved on the internet. when we were ready to check out and i had the confirmation at the internet rate, the manager on board credited me with the additional 20 pounds we had paid. imagine my chagrin and disappointment when the credit card bill arrived and the rembrandt had again billed us the additional 20 pounds! with management like that, we would not readily return to the rembrandt but would look probably at harrington hall. we had a chance to go there during our trip and was impressed, the rate was cheaper and the rooms were air-conditioned. signed me disappointed with the rembrandt'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i staid in the london mandarin for one night on a business trip. this actually is the only time i was disappointed by a mandarin oriented hotel. the building looks nice, but the rooms were small, a bit smelly and generally looked old and not very convenient. | the service was ok and friendly and the bar is quite modern and nice. so it is not all bad, but i certainly would never think of choosing this hotel again.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''to clarify this review is about the room i was in on mar 15-17, 2018. the renovations were nice except the worst design bathtub/shower combo i have ever seen. a half glass wall hinged to open (nice idea in theory) with a very large rainfall shower head - not a good combination. cannot turn on the water more than halfway as the glass wall does not contain the water (and unless you want to flood the bathroom). for the amount i spend a night (north of 600 pounds) i do not expect this kind of half baked solution. lots of other better hotels to stay at in this price range. service and food were nice but the poor design of the room is enough to turn me off. usually stay at the cafe royal on regent, which in my opinion is far better value for the money, and i am a fairmont's premier and past platinum club member.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''overal the hotel was very nice. | service at reception and bar was first class. | major problem was the room temperature. the windows are sealed so could not open. | despite setting thermostat as low as possible (19 degrees), the room stayed above 22 degrees all night. the fan coil circulated air with no cooling. i suspect the chillers are turned off. | despite a very fancy looking shower head, the water pressure in the shower created a mere trickle and the pump sounded like it was about to explode. | i did not relay my problems upon checkout as i was not asked how my stay or the room were. | i was more disappointed as we had paid an extra 100 to be upgraded from our standard room upon arrival. | also, it was not explained on check on that the room key card needs presenting to the buttons in the lift for it to work and allow you to select the floor required. even after establishing this fact, the key card gave up the ghost requiring me to dind the staircase (which is current part of s building site and not well marked) and return to reception to get a new card, just to get into my room after s night out. | overall the hotel is ok but not worth the money. i will not be returning.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''a bit of a hotel meringue really; pretty and frothy but ultimately somewhat unsatisfying. i liked the design by tom dixon (although a little like a showroom), along with the cocktails and views from the bar (dandylyan). i should also say that i booked on a very good rate so it was reasonable value. however, my superior room with river views was not that superior and did not really overlook the river. the windows are high with a large recess so you cannot see much unless stood right next to the window. at check-in, i was asked if i wanted to upgrade again which seems a bit strange for a hotel with such aspirations. breakfast was fine if a little noisy and rushed as they try to turn the tables over quickly. at check-out, my comments about the view were almost ignored and the bill was wrong. they fixed this and told me this was due to a rate fluctuation. | all in all, it is a nice place but the hotel should clearly define which are the rooms with good river views. service is fine nothing like the seamless efficiency you might find at a ritz-carlton. it is worth remembering that you can pop in for a drink in the bar and get much the same experience without the expense of the room. london edition is a better bet i would say.'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''stayed one night in the rembrandt in order to see a west end show. pretty much a standard city centre mid range hotel. only problem was the fact that the tv did not work after a hard evening in the city. no instructions were available and even dialling reception was difficult. a night manager did appear and juggled the wires whereupon the tv was repaired but one would expect such a hotel would check these things beforehand. buffet breakfast ok but as usual only warmish not hot.''',1
The Savoy,"'''we had stayed at the lansdowne club for one week (better than any 5 star hotel). they were fully booked for our final night in london so we decided to splurge (325pounds) &amp; spend our last night in london at the savoy. | we arrived at the hotel &amp; the taxi door was opened by a doorman who addressed me by my surname (very impressive). we were whisked inside &amp; greeted by a young lady who completed the reception particulars &amp; took us to our room. meanwhile, two very efficient bell men had taken our luggage up to our room. so far we are talking 5 stars. | once in our room i looked for instructions to turn on the wifi &amp; found it would cost 9:50pounds per day(about$15) we also checked for water &amp; could only find it in the minibar for $5:00. i hate getting nickeled &amp; dimed when your paying so much for a room so i went downstairs &amp; enquired. i was told i could get free wi-fi if i joined the ""fairmont presidents club"". so i joined the fpc for free. this form of gratuitous marketing should not happen at this price. | i returned to the room(#517) &amp; my wife pointed out the layer of dust on the minibar &amp; glass shelf above. there were two rings from drinking glasses on the marble top of the minibar. at this point (about 1pm) a man came to check the minibar. we explained that we would only been in the room for an hour &amp; could he clean the area. he &amp; the dust left but the drinking glass stains remained. we then started to look round our room. we found more dust inside the closets &amp; the armchair was stained by something red(blood,nail polish,lipstick??) | the design of the bedroom was ingenious &amp; well thought out. the designer had taken a relatively small room &amp; created closets &amp; draw space more than enough for two people for a week. the bathroom, however, was a different matter. at first glance it was gorgeous. carrera marble filled the whole space &amp; it looked really impressive; that is, until you used it. the beautiful marble shower has no shelves so that we had to put our soap &amp; shampoo on the floor &amp; keep bending over to pick up when you wanted to use them. it also had no handheld shower head; one of which sat idly at the other side of the room on the bath. much later when washing my face in the sink i had to go back to the shower &amp; grope around for the soggy soap on the floor as the savoy only issued one soap bar. another peculiarly british thing that i have noticed in highend ""art deco"" establishments around mayfair &amp; especially at the savoy; the toilet seats are shaped either oblong or square. most uncomfortable for normal people. do aristocratic brits have a different anatomy? | we dined that night in the river restaurant , service was impeccable from the ""maitre de"" to our waitress. i went for the dover sole it was cooked to perfection &amp; presented off the bone. i could not have wished for better service &amp; superb food. there was an excellent wine list according to my wife. however, i am a beer drinker &amp; the only beers available were perroni or heinekin. one would think that a top english restaurant would have some top english beers. one minor thing, few people seemed to observe the dress code which is smart casual. the man at the table next to us had a hawaiian shirt &amp; jeans. still, i am not sure how you control that. | we returned to our room &amp; found that it had not been turned down so we phoned reception. at 10:30 at night three cleaning ladies appeared. apparently they has missed the fifth floor completely which may have explained why our room was in such shabby condition. they finally brought in free bottles of water. they were still knocking on other guests doors doors an hour later. | breakfast next morning was excellent with good service. we said farewell to our room with the two drinking glass rings still there but checkout was seamless. | it is hard to judge this hotel. fairmount is trying to put its brand on the place instead of the savoy name which, to me, is a superior brand. | i stayed at the adlon hotel in berlin last september and i rated it 5 stars i think fairmont could take some lessons from them. | there were so many good things but a few bad things however, at that price there should be no bad things. therefore, i have to rate this hotel 3 stars'''",1

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''with excellent reviews i was tempted by this hotel and was weighing it against another high scoring but lower priced option. and then i saw the free rubber ducky, and i was sold. did i make the right choice? i am not so sure. for one thing, this place was difficult to find. even my cabby had to check. when i went out, i asked the front desk for directions. i was shown a map but incredibly they did not give it to me. i should have insisted, because coming back late at night and in the rain (pumpkin hour for london cabs) i found myself completely lost and wandered about for an hour or so. | as for the room, it was certainly done with panache and quality, but it was pretty tiny. i found the bed hard and did not sleep well. | at check in i was offered a breakfast special, but when i asked for it later that night the new shift did not know anything about it, so there was a bit of a fuss. it happened again at breakfast where they had not heard of the special. we got it sorted eventually, but i was beginning to regret my decision to opt for apex. really good breakfast, though. apex is not a bad hotel at all, i just did not find it equal to the level of reviews on ta. | but, hey, at least i have a rubber duck. thanks apex.'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''first, this is destination hotel and people come with high expectations. | its historical, and feels luxurious. lots of soft furnishings, marble bathrooms, deep carpets. big flower arrangements in the promenade. | issue is modern comfort. | beds are poor. old style spring with a thick top added - lumpy and saggy at same time. also my king was two singles together (which is common) but the set up is such that there is a big crevice/slant to the middle. you just do not get these issues in other modern 5 star hotels. | shower over bath. huge bath nearly a waste high to get in to shower - actually quite dangerous, for elderly it would be impossible. yes common in london... but for the price / 5 star... its time for a seperate shower. | really is time they put in a usb chargeing station/device. basic free wifi slow, but called up and got a code for faster. they should start with that. | location: so park lane is special... but not a lot of options to eat around that are modern and reasonable price. if you are planning on shopping in mayfair - great spot though. | there is a fair amount of road noise from park lane. heavy curtains help, a little. | breakfast at the grill. high quality (and price), but actually only a modest continential spread and limted a la carte options. service hit and miss. | similar to some other reviews. i had some issues with attitude from security a few times. signage is poor.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''arrived at the hotel for our last night in the uk before leaving back for home overseas with my partner, initially extremely impressed, great ambiance, decor and the staff extremely friendly. in the evening, my partner needed to use a business centre to reconfirm a flight for the next day, and was advised by the concierge that the hotel does not have a business centre, and advised no computer available for us to use, even though he was sat at his desk using a laptop. once we questioned further, and asked to use his laptop, he reluctantly agreed. i would expect a 5 star hotel to have such facilities, and for its staff to find solutions.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we attended the new years eve dinner and party at the savoy lancaster ballroom with friends. | the ballroom itself is a beautiful place for a dinner gala, almost as nice as the ritz main restaurant room. | the dinner was disappointing. at 450 per guest there was only one glass of champagne included in the menu. not even a glass of champagne to celebrate the new year during the firework. the food was average and the dessert was a chocolate pear ! nothing worth 450 par guest. | the first part of the nigh was amazing with a fantastic band. the second part of the night was a big disappointment with a couple singing some pop song over a loud music that covered their voice. | although the savoy is located close to the london eye the view of the firework was a massive disappointment. you either had to leave the dinner way before midnight to benefit from a clear view from the first floor. or you had to go outside and join the crowd to try to see the firework behind the trees. | overall this event was overpriced.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''great location. loved the top floor bar but even with a room upgrade we had a view of a building site. disappointing as that is the pull of the hotel. bar prices in the cocktail bar are very much ""london"" prices. service was great and the free tap water was a good benefit but it came at a london cost.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''travelled to london with two of my children to do some tourist things and wanted to stay somewhere nice. i have stayed in mandarin oriental in new york loved it. this was a bit of a let down. very old hotel, with carpet that has seen better days and woodwork battered to dead. staff very nice etc. but just lacked that crisp clean look that i have seen ny &amp; paris. the food was good but had to wait over 45mins for room service. watch out they charge you for wi-fi (they did take it off bill when i said it was a bit cheeky!!) all in all very pleasant stay but just a bit boring.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''it is not my nature to complain; however, in all my travels, i have never stayed at a hotel where the staff was so impersonal. with the exception of one doorman, the reception and door staff never once greeted us with a ""good morning"" or ""good evening"" during our five day stay. | the hotel is rather dated. for example, our room did not have a shower stall - just a shower hose in the bathtub. | the food at the hotel restaurant was very poor. we gave up after two breakfast meals. the food was not fresh and had little taste. | the housekeeping service was very good. | also, i have never had to pay for the entire stay at check-in when the terms and conditions allow for only one night cancelation fee. | in my opinion, not worthy of a four star hotel status. i would rate as a border line three star hotel.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed in a family room and through the website direct got the best price-although still well over 100 but did include breakfast which was good compared to other websites visited (and in fairness it is august at the seaside so i am aware it was a pretty standard rate for the area) | the room was well presented, beds comfy and the cleanliness was excellent. | we had 2 windows-1 with a view of a wall which was a few feet away and 1 overlooking a flat roof which was a view shared by other rooms. i knew it was not a seaview as not on the seafront but i have had better views out of motorway service accommodation! | we slept well but when little one (aged 4) woke early we put the telly on to find there was no cbeebies. this was obviously not ideal as no other dedicated childrens channel available either. surprising to have family rooms but not a full family package. | we made use of the swim facilities and the pool had a large shallow area perfect for younger children in addition to the dedicated swim area which enabled different pool usage at the same time which was great. | the breakfast was really good-a lovely range of well cooked and well presented food so worth getting. | overall i think i might have expected abit more, however did not think it was bad, came away happy and we had a fabulous time in weymouth.'''",1

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''at $700 per night this was a huge disappointment. the location, across from harvey nichols, down the street from harrod's and close proximity to shopping, restaurants, and parks is the best thing going for it. | the room, public areas, and elevators are all very well worn. the bathroom was extremely poorly thought out and very claustrophobic feeling. the bed was very comfortable which was a definite plus. | the beefeaters out front were very charming and smartly dressed. from the grand exterior, you would expect a much more refined interior and unfortunately this just was not the case. | the highlight of the visit was the trip to the spa and the massage. sonya was very skilled in her work and provided a great experience. | on my next trip however, i will have to forgo the mandarin for the four seasons.'''",1

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i stayed at the ridgemount for 6 nights march-april, 2005. the room was very small but i did not go to london to spend time in the room anyway. the bathroom was adequate. i would recommend asking for a room at the back, if possible, as the traffic on gower street can be quite noisy. the breakfast is very filling and kept us going until dinner, which was very good considering the dismal exchange rate. the ridgemount has an excellent location for visiting the british museum and is very close to several tube stations. we, also, found the fellow travelers to be very friendly and had some excellent conversations in the comfortable parlor. the cofee/tea machine in the parlor is an added bonus. there is also internet access in the parlor for a small cost.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''this may sound petty but it is supposed to be a classy hotel. went for a pre-theatre drink and was disappointed by the way the staff speak. they have all been taught a robotic and insincere sounding greeting, asking 'how are you this evening?' they also each used the phrase 'no problem' after taking our order. i am not actually bothered about whether it is a problem or not and it irritates me! the drinks in the beaufort bar were extremely good however, despite the fact that there is little point in the palaver of asking if someone wants to taste their wine if it is too dark to see the colour. bartenders in all the top hotels know how to prepare cocktails and this was certainly true here. a lovely gin martini and an excellent chilean red from a small boutique vineyard.

The Rembrandt,"'''was utterly disappointed with this hotel. i expected more for this class of a hotel. we stayed here from feb 17-19. we came in around 5pm. to our disappointment, the room was not ready yet. it took them about 30 min to get the room ready. when we needed some ice for the room at night, they will charge 3 just for the ice to be delivered, this small thing should be done as a courtesy to their guests. | the front staff were not really that welcoming as well. they just stood there and wait. they would only give you a mechanical smile if you go and approach them for something. unlike other hotels where as soon as you get in, you are greeted with a smile and a ""hello"". they were not even helpful when we were checking out. they did not offer to help us with our bags. | i do hope management would look into this closer. good thing we did not stay here for a long time.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we loved the decor of the hotel when you walk into the door. but, we walked into our room, and it was nothing like the pictures. the room was horrible, and apparently one of the un-renovated rooms. we were stuck in a crappy room, and, once we came back from shopping and dinner, we had a horrible smell coating the whole room. apparently, they had cleaned the carpets, and a stench radiated all over the small room. the bathroom was horrible, and had disgusting toilets and showers. we ended up switching rooms at 12:00 at night, to a much more comfortable room. we were there for easter, and they had a great easter egg hunt with huge prizes. it was very fun for the kids. breakfast was great, and the large room was beautiful i would say, to stay there, but ask for specific rooms that have been recommended by others.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the mondrian is trying too hard. it is going for a trendy look, but is a bit off. the service is also not great. we walked in for the first time laden with luggage, and there are no staff to help with bags. after hefting our bags up to the desk to check in, the attendant tried to up-sell us to a suite for literally double what we had booked. we declined. | when we got to our room, it was tiny and cramped. the whole hotel feels like you are in a confined space. the bathroom does have nice soaps and shampoos, but the beds are not the same level of comfort as what we have experienced at other hotels. | the location is ok if you are looking for something different, however there are not a lot of shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. also the nearest tube station is across the blackfriars bridge, so is a bit of a walk. | there are usb ports in the wall for charging electronics, but they do not work, which is frustrating. | overall is ok, but would not stay here again.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''if you are like me, you have spent a ridiculous amount of hours poring over hotel reviews in an effort to pick the right hotel to ensure that your inevitabaly expensive stay in london will be a pleasant one. i would love to give the rembrandt a completely glowing review, but my experience would seem to indicate that it is not necessarily which hotel you stay in, but which room you are assigned in any given hotel. when i first got to my fifth floor room of the rembrandt, i would say that my feeling was of resigned, but mild disappointment. the room was badly dated, a bit tattered, smelled weird, and had unsightly stains on the ceiling. i was ok with it though, because despite all that, the bathroom and the sheets seemed reasonably clean and the hotel is in a good location. then, on my first morning there, i was woken up at about 7:00 am by loud, jocular conversation in the room next to mine. i figured that this was just a couple of guys packing up to leave, but then there were more voices, and louder talking. at about 8:00 am, someone started a circular saw that sounded like it was literally inches from my head. a few moments later there was hammering so loud that it really sounded as though they were coming through the wall. this was obviously intolerable. i sometimes like to stay out a bit late when i am on vacation and i occasionally like to have the luxury of sleeping until 10:00. when i complained at the front desk, the staff could not have been any more accommodating. they offered a genuine apology, and upgraded me to a superior room. this room was fresh, clean, quiet and comfortable.although i must say that if i had been paying the superior price i may have been a bit disappointed. they describe these rooms as ""garden view"", but they really look out on the back of the hotel. so if you are considering a stay at this hotel in the near future, i would recommend that you insist on a room that has already been rennovated, which probably means a room on one of the lower floors. if you have a decent room, this hotel is a pretty good value: good location , professional staff, nice breakfast buffet, and reasonably priced by london standards. you should be aware that the hotel attracts an older crowd. i am forty, and seemed to be one of the younger guests. also, unless you are independently wealthy, do not use the hotel dry cleaning service- 2 pairs of jeans, four dress shirts and a pair of socks were over $100.00 !!!!!!!- a somewhat unpleasant surprise on my departure.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''good quality/price. good option if you intend to rest just a couple of days in the city and spend the day outside for visiting. the location is by far the best point since its a middle/high class neighbourhood you have the padigton station just one street away and also many quality restaurants around the area. it was our first time in london and we are so satisfied for staying on this hotel because we had everything we need at our side: a central station to go anywhere in london, convenience stores to change money or buy a last midnight snack, and the hyde park just 3 minutes away.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i booked an executive room at this hotel. i looked at the reviews and have walked past it many times so thought i would try it. the location is great if you like kensington. | check in was fine. i was asked if i wanted papers in the morning, to which i ordered 2, then was told i would have to pay for them. at the price i paid for the room, they did not include a newspaper, amazing. so i still ordered the papers. i asked what time they recommended i go down for breakfast, to avoid waiting. breakfast starts at 7am till 10am. their recommendation was to go between 7 and 8am. i knew there to be a problem with the size of the breakfast room, but did not expect i would have to be so early. i was also given 2 free tickets for the health club, in with the package, otherwise you have to pay 7.00. so on a normal tariff, you have to pay for newspapers and to swim, which at 189 the full price tariff, is scandalous. | the room was supposedly an executive double. to be honest i would hate to see a normal double. the room reminded me of the old trusthouse forte rooms in the cumberland, ok but nothing special and very small. the room should have been set for 2 people as mrs c should have been coming, but in reality it was set for 1 person. the air conditioning sounded like an aircraft taking off when on cool so decided to open windows instead. the room was ok but nothing special. | the bathroom on the other hand had not been cleaned properly. there were black long hairs in the bath. i mentioned it to the front desk on my wait out but nothing was done on my return. | in the evening i went to the health club for a swim. the club is small and below ground level so is very dark. the sauna was cold so tried the steam room, which was good. the gym was limited with only a few cardio machines and very limited weights. the pool was small but warm. the jacuzzi was just bubbles. a matter of concern for me as a lawyer, was on the steps into the jacuzzi, a sharp metal piece of the step was bent upwards and could easy cut someone. i reported it and was told it was not a priority. he had pointed it out to the manager of the club but nothing had been done. i said to him that its a danger, and he confirmed someone had cut their finger open the week before. i think this sums up the service...ok and polite but in reality could not really care less. | when going to bed i noticed how thin the walls must be. my next door neighbour decided to conduct a business meeting with someone in la via his mobile, until 3am. you could hear every word. no soundproofing, on a new remodelled room......in the modern world sound proofing of walls can be done in old hotel rooms. | i woke up, opened my doors to collect my papers and no papers. went for breakfast, which was ok, standard london buffet style, when it was quiet at 7am. then went back to bed to try and get some sleep. at 8.30 housekeeping began to service the room next door to me and again you could hear everything, banging doors and hoovering. i had a do not disturb sign on the door but they ignored this and knocked. i do think cleaning rooms so early is totally unacceptable, why so early when it disturbs other guests? at 9.30 i decided to leave the hotel. i still had not received my newspapers. when asked if all was ok, i went through the dirty bath that had not been cleaned, the sound proofing, dangerous step on jacuzzi and the lack of newspapers. the response to dirty bath, ""i will inform housekeeping"". no apology. to the jacuzzi, ""that is separate"" well no its not its owned by the hotel and is a health and safety risk. on the newspapers, ""what is the problem, you were not charged for them"". the cleaning at 8.30 and soundproofing ""that is not our problem"". | so how would i sum up this hotel. on the face of it, all the staff i met, apart from the check out receptionist were very friendly on the surface. behind this face, nothing was really done, no real service was offered. the room was overpriced for what was given. executive rooms are small and standard, nothing special. the hotel is simply a standard 4 star building with poor customer care. i look for hotels that offer small things in rooms and give just that little bit extra in terms of service. this hotel does not give any of these things, but its also not bad. if you can get a clean room in the region of 100 to 120, i think it would be ok. the prices the hotel tries to charge are too high given what is provided. my advice try the 5 star capital hotel in the same area, and charges the same sort of prices, the capital is far better at that price range.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''first the name. why add sea containers? did not see any nearby and the hotel did not appear to be made from them. this hotel is trying way too hard to be cutting edge cool. the check in guy was trying to be my friend rather than tell me anything about the hotel. they put an outrageous hold on your credit card for incidentals( read damage or theft). but the rooms were clean and bed comfortable. the hotel is in a good location. and we did not overpay. so iwould recommend this hotel.''',1

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we booked this hotel on the back of having read so many good reviews on trip advisor. we stayed on a saturday evening. i am afraid that our experience was nowhere near as positive as most other guests. the reception staff were at best off'ish and in one case, rude! the room was a bit on the small side and despite it being quiet and asking for a room with a view, we were placed in a side room with a disappointing view of an office block. the room was very clean. breakfast was ok and the waiters were friendly and attentive. unfortunately this is more than can be said about the bar staff at the off the wall bar! they were slow and almost hostile! 7.80 for a coffee and coke seems pricey! finally the hotel is quite some distance from the centre of london and at week-ends there is nothing open directly near the hotel. having said that spitalields and brick lane is only a 15 minute walk away.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed here over valentines weekend and i chose this hotel as in the pictures it looked really nice and had positive reviews on here. on the whole the hotel was clean, the room was a decent size for a london hotel room and the location good. | however, just a few gripes. the room was booked in my partners name and i arrived there first so used my credit card for a tab and manually added my details to the room booking. when i wanted to charge drinks to the room later on that evening, on leaving the bar, the waiter came up to us and asked if the room was booked under a different name. i would have thought there would have been better communication here. at breakfast on the sunday there were not enough tables and at breakfast on the monday the waitress wanted to take my plate before i had finished eating. the breakfast selection was average. usually when i stay in hotels there are a couple of complimentary bottles of water but here there were not any. | on a positive note, the staff were friendly, the room (as stated earlier) was clean and i did really like the walk in shower. | it is unlikely that we will stay here again because the standard of other similar priced hotels is a bit better than this.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel is stunning - probably one of the most beautiful hotels in london. but at a minimum of 400 per night, i was flabbergasted when asked to pay 25 for my morning swim. the reason i was given? espa is independent of the hotel. well of course it is - most top hotels use espa, elemis or some other established spa brand. but they do not charge hotel guests for use of their pools. if espa at gleneagles do not charge then espa at corinthia should not charge either. if espa wants money from each guest that uses their pool then they should take this up with corinthia and collect the money from them instead. | i swim every morning and every evening. my stay was for 4 nights. if my wife had been with me then i would have had 400 of swimming charges added to my bill. completely outrageous. i declined the offer to pay 25 for 3 hours maximum in the pool and went to a nearby gym instead. one of the main reasons i chose the corinthia was for it is thermal floor. i left the hotel feeling duped as the policy is nowhere to be seen on their website - nor is it mentioned on check-in. if corinthia wants to be considered one of the finest hotels in london then it really must address this pay-as-you-swim charge. this is a 5-star hotel - not an easyjet flight.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''spa facilities until 10pm in the heart of knightsbridge and you do not have to be a hotel guest, but only if you buy 10 passes for 150 that last for 6 months ( works out @ 15 each time you visit ) | do not expect the luxury of the area it is located in, it feels more like a council gym and pool and lacks the ambience portrayed in the images. the small pool feels like swimming in bleach. i know this because i sneeze non stop if i am in an over chlorinated water and i can still smell the chlorine even after showering thoroughly and the jacuzzi lacks power. | if you want to chat with your partner ( unless your partner is the same sex as you ) in the sauna or steam, well you cannot because these facilities are in the changing rooms. | treatments stop at 8pm, so no late night foot massage if you have been out on your feet all day shopping. i would say the benefit of this place is that you can stay until as late as 10pm. kind helpful staff who do their best to be accommodating.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''if you are looking for a reasonably priced accomodation, that is clean, and well located, with a friendly staff, then pick the rhodes hotel. the room was very small and everything was very basic, but we left early in the day and did not get back until late in the evening, so it was all we were really looking for. it was very reasonably priced - way less than any place else we looked at, and the location was perfect for walking to many of the major sites, as well as to 2 tube stops. the staff let us check in early, helped us with our luggage, checked the price the cab charged us to make sure we were not being over charged, called us a taxi, etc. they do advertise they have wireless network, but it unfortunatelly did not work until the last night we were there - but that was not any fault of their's. i would definately reccomend this hotel to someone who knew what they were getting - if you need or want something more than basic, though, you may want to spend a little more.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''it is not our first time at the corinthia, we have stayed there several times. the hotel is really nice but we noticed that the quality decreased. | our problems: | -no mobile connection in the rooms, we had to go to lobby/street to use our mobiles | -wifi connection gets disconnected frequently | -housekeeping problems: housekeeping took away dirty coffee cups, glasses, plates etc. but forgot to bring new ones...not a good surprise before your morning coffee. they left the windows open in the rooms so when we returned in the pm, it was freezing in the rooms. not a nice surprise in winter with 5 degrees outside....i found dirty glasses next to the minibar in the cupboard that was left from a previous guest..disgusting! i saw greasy hair left on the hairdryer from another guest...i almost threw up. | i am very sensitive about these hygiene issues so i was unsure if the room was properly cleaned at all and i did not feel good staying in the room. | it is a shame because i think it is a beautiful hotel but i am afraid i will not come back for a while.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we stayed here in a room for 5 for 3 nights. the staff were friendly and the room was adequate although not spacious (but that is expected in central london i suppose!) the shower cubicle very small which made showering the children a challenge!. it was very hot when we stayed and there is no air conditioning, although a fan is supplied. the kids loved the garden and especially the guinea pigs! the location was good and convenient for the piccadilly line. it was also very quiet at night which was a pleasant surprise for being in the middle of town.'''",1

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''due to an unfortunate oversight on my part, we were unable to stay at our favorite hotel in this area and ended up at the mandarin oriental instead. oh, the room was large and well furnished (although extremely dark), and the premises clean and tidy. the service was generally good, too. unfortunately we did not have a room with a view of hyde park, which might have made a difference about how we felt about this hotel, but the age of the building, despite the extensive remodeling, bothered us. every walk down the hallways over the very creaky floorboards made us feel as if we were in a haunted house. and the lovely and modern bathroom looked great--it just did not work well and the courteous staff were unable to make it work well. the stall shower did not drain fast enough (despite 6 maintenance calls and literally hours of time spent by the staff to repair the problem) so we were constantly forced to take ""military-style"" showers so as not to flood the hotel. shame, shame mandarin oriental. this is unacceptable. | there is an up side however. both the cocktail lounge and restaurant(s) were excellent every time and even provided us with some lively entertainment and conversation, since various celebrities seem to habitue these venues on a regular basis. among others, we saw an inebriated pop star stumble from the cocktail lounge and fall flat on his face in the lobby (he was not seriously hurt), and another night, while we were eathing, a former british prime minister and party sat nearby having dinner and quite a lively, yet lovely, conversation.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''service was without question superb. | rooms were comfortable and up to standard | bathrooms we below par: plugs that did not fit basins properly and a dud light bulb. a real lack of attention to detail | the english breakfast only just passed muster, but tepid grilled tomatoes and mushroom, dry bacon and a slightly slummy sausage. not quite as good as british airways club breakfast except for the egg which was perfect. if you want a five star breakfast the do not try the english breakfast. a shadow of what might have been! disappointing!'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''firstly i want to say the service in this hotel was really excellent - we were only there for 1 night but they were friendly and efficient. | i would say that the rooms are not 5 star and the walkways through the hotel during its refurbishment is not attractive or efficient. i understand that refurbishments need to be done however when you are paying for a premium hotel you expect more. | also using the bathroom after breakfast near the spa there were 6 or so cubicles - 2 of which were unusable. there is no excuse for this. | having recently stayed in the savoy and claridges i do feel this hotel is not in the same league.''',1
The Savoy,"'''we attended a charity ball recently at the savoy hotel. the hotel was beautiful the meal excellent but as a blue badge holder the lack of facility to the particular ballroom was truly appalling. | we asked members of staff twice if there was some alternative to the long walk and really large curved staircase. we were told sorry there was not. we took a lift we found which could only take us to the basement not our venue. i had the option of going back to the hotel we were staying in, (which incidentally magnificently accommodated my disability) or with my friends help seriously struggle to make it. | it was dreadful and i have suffered exceptional pain with 2 days in bed since as well as being truly embarrassed to be in such difficulty and awkwardness.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''the location is very handy but in a sense it is also it is undoing. this hotel used to be a class act full of class people. now it seems full of aspirational scruffily dressed tourists. our room was nothing at all special for 500 a night and we had no hot water on our first evening. the boiler was at fault. astonishing in a hotel of this class. no offer of any discount when we complained. the american bar is grossly over rated with all the charm of a railway waiting room. ""best bar in the world"" my backside.the staff though are exceptional. in contrast we went for a drink one evening during our stay at the claridge hotel. now that is a lovely bar much nicer ambiance. nicer guests - altogether classier. needless to say we will not be going back to the savoy - which is a shame.'''",1

Newham Hotel,"'''we were in london to visit some friends towards the end of july and had booked into newham hotel. | general impression: | we had read mixed reviews of the hotel and decided to give it a chance (benefit of the doubt). to our surprise, the hotel did deliver and matched to our expectation. it is not one of a 5 star hotel standard; newham hotel did require some upgrading. the staff (reception, cleaners, kitchen) are all very helpful and friendly; they are also very fast in responding to requests: extra pillows, towels, special request when checking in, etc. the hotel is easily accessible (located around 10 min by bus from stratford station) and it provides free car parking. while (simple, typical english) breakfast is provided, there is no room service, but there is a 24-hour mcdonald a stone's throw away. navigating in the hotel is interesting with the long corridors and lack of signage. | bedroom: | our twin-bed bedroom with ensuite was filled with filled with bulky, mismatched furniture that took up space than being useful; we actually rearranged the furniture to make the room more spacious and less of a warehouse. the bed linen was very comfortable, my partner felt that the pillow was too soft/ low for him, but it is no hassle to request an additional pillow with the reception. there is no fan or aircon in the room and it can get relatively warm, especially when all the downlights are turned on and the windows are not able to be fully opened. as the whole room is carpeted, the floor near the entrance to the bathroom can get relatively damp. | bathroom/ toilet: | the water pressure in the shower is low, but there is no issue with getting warm/ cold water. however, the bathroom does lack maintenance: the shower door is broken and the tap on the sink is loose. a towel per person and a bar of soap is provided, so bring your own toiletries. | all in all, the hotel is value for money, it does need some upgrading but does provide the basic that is required. did i mention the fantastic staff? :)'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''rooms are nice but it is very expensive due to it is location their are a few hotels next to them a lot cheaper but this ones expensive. nice rooms though, could be cheaper. i would go back here again if i had no other choice,'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''booked for 2 nights in half term while we made plans to see some sight in the capital. | wanted 4 comfy beds as we are always booked into a ""family"" room and the little one ends up with a ""put you up bed"" so this had what we were after and was near to where we wanted to be. | got there on the tuesday and left bags at 11, told room was not ready until 2 so we hit oxford street! got back to the hotel at 2.15 and the room was 10 minutes away from being ready which actually meant 40 minutes as we were not given the key until nearly 3pm after waiting in the front room, needing to freshen up and get back out as we were booked into the shard at 5pm. | they put us in the family room - on the top floor! nearly 7 flights of stairs to get to the room almost killed me, no joke. | room did what we wanted, one double and 2 single very comfy beds and a whirlpool bath that hubby used although unfortunately we never got the chance as we were out all day on the wednesday and came back to the room quite late at night. | the breakfast was continental and everything you need to set you off for the day, cooked english and omelettes were an extra charge. | polite people, the ones we saw, mainly at breakfast. | would i use this hotel again? probably not as i cannot bear doing the stairs again, such a let down for the price we paid.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed in a riverview deluxe with breakfast for one night. the view was good, the room quite small. the bed, though kingsize is not long enough for anyone 6.3 or over. toiletries were disappointing - i challenge anyone to enjoy a peppermint shampoo, followed by a lemongrass conditioner, whilst dousing themselves with rum shower gel....... distinctly unpleasant. | the breakfast was thoroughly disappointing - buffet only with overbaked bacon, lukewarm tomatoes and sloppy scrambled egg. for this level of hotel we would expect the option of a breakfast menu. when we mentioned this on checking out, we were told it is designed for speed and efficiency of service..... it was simply not a relaxing start to the day..... | that said, the staff were all very friendly, a helpful concierge gave great info on river boats and the drinks in dandelion bar were delicious and service was splendid. (but a shame the roof top bar was closed at 4.30 on a saturday afternoon.) | we stay in london several times a year - but in our opinion, this does not represent the value for money that the haymarket, hamyard, soho hotel, browns or aldwich offer. | and by the way - when we were offered the chance of an upgrade - they wanted 120 for it - on previous occasions at the afforementioned, this has been complimentary - as is the room spray - not placed on the side with a 19 label attached to it!!!'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my husband and i stayed for 3 nights last sept. the room was nice but a little on the small side. we found breakfast service was good ( we ate from the buffet). we were disappointed with the hotels restaurant after returning from a show (approx. 10pm) we were told there was no meal service just snacks and drinks. we usually stay at four seasons properties and found this a bit lacking in comparison. the spa was very nice, we enjoyed our time spent there. location was good. we will try a different hotel next time in london as the lack of available food choices was disappointing.'''",1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''the hotel is in kennsington which is very convenient for a tourist. the surrounding area is like a village. there are plenty of pubs, cafes and shops. also several businesses for laundry and dry cleaning at very good prices. the hotel itself (in our case) had very small rooms, you would not want to spend a lot of time in your room. also there was no bar fridge, so you do not have any place for fruit/cold cuts/bread/milk.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i really really wanted to come back from taking my mother to the savoy for afternoon tea to celebrate her 50th birthday on 29/4/13 and write a glowing review. really, i did. sadly, this is not the case. although it was a very special experience, it would put me off staying there (if i could ever afford it!) let alone eating there again. | it all started with the arrival. the doormen were busy taking something in through a side door, and did not even notice our arrival. no greeting, no opening the door for us, nothing. then when we arrived in the lobby, we were just stood there not knowing what to do. nobody came over to offer us any assistance, even though there must have been 10 members of staff in the lobby. bitterly disappointing first impression. | we were sat down and had the menus explained to us, and they were already aware of my mother's diabetes (i had mentioned this in my booking form and in the confirmation phone call a few days beforehand) so all was good there. however, they knew the time of our arrival, but the sugar free scones for my mother were still baking in the oven, as a result she received hers long after i had received mine. it was the same with the pastries. i would have thought our food would have come at the same time to allow us to enjoy it together. | our waitress also left us on several occasions to go and talk to her mother in the bar, which i thought was rather rude to be quite honest. | so, although the food was very good, i found the service took the gloss off the whole experience.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i am biased towards fairmont hotels. i generally love the classic buildings, the great service, the perks of president's club membership and the locations. for many years i have wanted to stay at the savoy but the price was prohibitive (especially with several children in tow). | finally i was able to stay at this iconic property and sadly to say, it just was not worth the horrific amount of money. i will gladly pay through the nose for something really special. this hotel just was not it. | the best thing about the savoy is the location. you likely cannot find a better one; walk to westminster cathedral in 10 minutes and st paul's in 15. on the thames, in the west end, a stone's throw from trafalgar square, etc. | the room we were upgraded to had an angled view of the thames which was quite nice. i prefer the edwardian furnishings and we were able to get one of those. the room was a decent size and the bathroom, although all white and gray, roomy enough. lovely towels and a heated towel bar. there was a large wardrobe with enough hangers. the bed was wonderful and very comfortable. the air-conditioning barely took the edge of the heat (you can only dial the temperature down so far) but the water temperature of the showers could not go above moderately warm. odd. likely a cost cutting measure. | the hotel is strangely designed. up and down stairs, along snaking corridors to get to the lift that takes you to your wing, etc. i found it off putting not quaint or quirky. | you must pay for internet unless you are a president's club member and the wifi was a bit spotty. | the rooms are advertised as having an iron, tea and coffee, etc but in fact you must ring up guest services to have these delivered to your room. each and everything is hand delivered and a tip is expected. want ice? place a call and wait for someone to bring it to you. this was one of the things that really bugged me; so many staff needing to be tipped. | in fact the service was just far over the top and bordered on really intrusive. our doorbell rang 5 times within the hour of arriving in the room and there were two phone calls. as we were jet lagged and exhausted we finally had to ask for everyone to leave us alone. | the other outrageous prices (other than the room) were in the restaurants and the bars. a typical english breakfast (eggs, toast, bacon, sausage, etc) 32 gbp ($58). toast was $5 a slice! a bowl of watery oatmeal $16. i tried several types of breakfast but was not overly struck by anything. | the american bar was worse. highly uncomfortable chairs (do not you want patrons to linger and order more drinks???) and prices so silly it was laughable. most cocktails were around $35 each. premium liquors had sky high prices. | we did have an excellent meal in kaspar's seafood bar and would definitely return there. | over all i was a bit disappointed and likely will not bother to return. i will spend my money at the fairmont properties that truly do a superb job (the orchid, vancouver, toronto, montreal, etc).'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''pros: big comfy bed with crisp linen, helpful and happy staff, spotlessly clean, lovely buffet breakfast and ideal location. | cons: bedroom size - we were in a so-called executive double and it was the smallest hotel room i have ever experienced, with a bathroom to scale! the dimensions would have been ideal for people used to caravan holidays with, realistically, only one person able to move around the room at one time. there was no fridge - and very few electric sockets, especially around the tiny working desk. bathroom? back into the caravan! i am not the slimmest in the world, but nor am i the bulkiest and there was no way i could get into the narrow bath - and getting under the shower was like part of an obstacle course. | summing up - lovely hotel, but quite a squeeze.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''these are the gliches that we experienced. in spite of this, we enjoyed our stay, liked the staff, and enjoyed our room. attention to the details noted, however, should improve the overall experience. | the savoy addressed an initial email to me in the wrong gender. i corrected this. | the room was freezing when we arrived and we could not regulate the thermometer ourselves. we phoned for some help. we were told someone would come, but no one ever did. we were asked what newspaper we would like at check in and indicated the nytimes, but it never arrived. i asked again, but it never arrived that day or the following. it was on our bill at the time of check-out for each day. they removed this and the internet charges as well due to the mistake. the maid service in the morning was very noisy outside and woke us up, going on for long lengths of time with doors opening/shutting, etc. i asked that evening for them to consider how to address this and we had no issue with it the next two mornings. the second morning we received a bill for one night, even though we were scheduled for 3. the receptionist indicated she only had us reserved for one. she was flustered and obviously embarrassed and took care of this on her own. we ordered tea and coffee the morning we were leaving and they said it would be there in 15 minutes and it never arrived. i phoned a half hour later and they said that it would be right up, they had our room number wrong. they rushed the coffee and tea up, but by that time we had little time to drink. we were still charged for this. | the morning of our departure i asked how we could print out our boarding passes for our plane and was told by the receptionist and the woman at check-out that the concierge would help us with this. we waited for the concierge, who was busy, and then he said we needed to go to the business center. when i indicated that we were sent to him by two people in the hotel and would pull this up from email he said, ""and do i have access to your email address?"" when we went to the business center we were let in by ourselves and the printer did not work. we were hurrying to get to the airport. we had to find someone to help us find the other printer in a different section of the business center that had a printer attached. they informed us that the hotel car service to gatwick airport was 195 pounds, and that a taxi might save us 30 pounds. we took a taxi and it was only 100 pounds. we were placed in a very bad place for the tea service and had to ask to be moved. the table was in the far corner by the servers table and as they hustled by the table shook and banged. really, they should not have anyone sit there and no one did after we were moved. i hope our bad table was not because we were two females. we were also placed iintially at the table nearest the servers/kitchen door in the savoy grill, and asked to be moved. in both instances we had advance reservations and others behind us were seated in better locations. the changed tables were great, but having to ask for a better table should not be necessary. when i was in college and worked in a fine dining establishment we were told to place 2 females in the least desired location. that was 30+ years ago. i would not expect this from the savoy. it was troubling to both of us. we stay at other fine hotels, such as the ritz-carlton, the penninsula, and the sofitel, and have not had this happen. they should work on this. there were lovely things about the hotel that actually overshadowed all the noted gliches, although the last day, the number of issues did add up to frustration with that day's experience. the workout/spa area is very well maintained and attended to. the chocolates in the hand made chocolate shop were delicious and the service was lovely. the food at the savoy grill was very nice. the tea service was adequate but the sandwiches were not notable. the room was cozy once we fixed the heating issue - after 12 hours. in spite of the issues noted, we enjoyed our stay.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i have read some of the reviews and wondered whether i was staying in the same hotel. i now realize that my experience might have been different because i was staying in a basic room ( which they called superior) while they must have been i the higher end rooms. | well, the room was just fine, nothing out of the ordinary. the room was spacious enough and the bathroom fine as well. i usually prefer to have separate rooms for the toilet /bathroom, but it was all in one. the room was a basic four star hotel room. | hotel location is great, and doormen and reception staff were welcoming and helpful.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''have just spent a night here, it has a very modern interior design look and everything is very trendy including the staffs uniform. unfortunately design and look forgets about practicality. for instance a small thing , no where to unpack your case, so you put it on the bed therefore leaving dirty marks all over the bed. 2 very modern designed chairs but nowhere my side of the bed to put your clothes etc. bathroom large but again only 2 small door hooks, where do you put wet towels to dry as no rail or towel rail. shower very noisy pump and over head shower had very poor pressure, hand held had good pressure. door handle/lock not working. this a very popular trendy hotel but it needs to deal with the guests basic needs and not just the look of the place. it is in a fantastic position on river.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''it is undeniable that the significant renovation has given the hotel a much needed revitalization. the improvements and decor are indeed elegant. we stayed for three nights in a room and upgraded to a suite when a third family member joined us. the location is fantastic, being central and close to covent garden, the theatre and the stores. there is lip service given with the intent to do the best, but the action is not carried through from our experience. pity...management needs to work on getting their staff to follow through with their actions and attentiveness. case in point, we met with some friends at the hotel bar before departing for dinner. a hotel staff greeted us at the bar and offered to take my coat to my suite as i did not need it for dinner. that coat did not show up the following day and in calling butler service to trace it, several hours later it was found (and we still did not know where) and was retrieved to our suite. i would have the laundry picked up with specific instructions to have shirts hung instead of being folded for business meetings. they get returned folded. these details count especially for a hotel of this rating and calibre. we have not experienced these kinks in other hotels of this pedigree in any place else we have stayed. when we checked out however, we met a young staff who was eager to find out about our stay. he duly noted the experience we have had at the hotel which we shared with him. hopefully management gets the message and help improve on delivering a better service. | all things being equal, great name, location, beautiful architecture and decor, what makes the biggest difference in the choice of one hotel over the other for us is service.'''",1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we could not fault the look, decor and furnishings, all very plush and modern. the room was tiny, we could not both move around at the same time! however the bedding was really nice, beautifully laundered and comfy. | okay they were the good bits, here goes with the bad bits. firstly, our bathroom basin was blocked, not just slow to empty but refused to empty. 10 minutes with a plastic fork soon sorted this, but should not have been necessary in the first place. secondly, although each room has a tablet, the wifi on the fifth floor was a joke, 99% unavailable and then only for about 20 seconds. not much point in the room being equipped with the tablet in the first place, as it was no use whatsoever. | lastly, breakfast. we looked forward to our cooked breakfast which had been included in our booking, and made our way to eat at 9am. we were quickly shown to a table where it was confirmed that we had paid for a cooked breakfast, and the lady took our order for tea and coffee, saying that she would return with a menu. so we waited, and waited, and waited. after about twenty minutes we enquired as to where our drinks might be with another member of staff, who returned after five minutes with our drinks (which had obviously been forgotten about earlier). once again we waited for someone to bother to take our food order. another fifteen minutes passed and once again we had to ask the same man if he would mind taking our order, he seemed surprised that we had not already been asked, as all around us people were being served quite promptly. finally after another eternity, as my partner had had enough and was heading back to the room, our meal arrived. we finally made it back to our room one hour and twenty minutes after we left it to eat. to say we were unimpressed is an understatement. | a beautiful hotel, but i do not think that our luck was with us this weekend! | oh, i almost forgot about the fire alarm sounding at 2.05am. just what we needed..........'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the location of the hotel is wonderful, the rooms are spacious, though decorated in burgundy ( not my taste at all ), and the food is dreadful. there are no options for breakfast earlier than 7am whereas most hotels offer a couple of basic options at least on their 24 hr room service menu. | the staff are friendly and everything almost hits the mark but always just misses. the bed is large and comfortable but the wardrobe small. the bar is fine but the restaurant dreadful( both of the meals had to be sent back )etc etc.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the first impression was bad because the hotel gave us a room in the basement with no major facilities. then, we are transferred to a room on the 2nd floor but was not cleaned properly (dirty floor and dirty sheets) however during our stay the staff did all for our convenience. they are very attentive and friendly. but i do not advise this hotel. location is great, near paddington station.'''",1

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''if you are looking for luxury then this hotel will not be for you. if you want central london at around 50 a night, then this is a pretty good bet. | it is in bloomsbury, just round the corner from the british museum and easily accessible from euston square/goodge st/russell square tube stops. location cannot be beaten. | the room was basic but comfortable. it reminded me of the student halls i have stayed in nearby - plain decor, no frills. the furnishings and bedlinen were a little worn, and there was a bit of mould in the grouting in the bathroom and limescale on the taps, but everything was very clean and the carpet and curtains appeared new. i had an ensuite twin room on the ground floor - it looked out onto the main road, which was quite noisy with traffic, so perhaps ask for one facing away from the road if you are bothered by this. | there were a hairdryer, towels, and old tv, but no kettle or toiletaries other than a small bar of soap. as i bring my own shampoo etc anyway it did not matter for that price. there are plenty of late-closing supermarkets and chemists on goodge st/tottenham court road anyway if you forget to bring toiletaries. the bed also had feather pillows - which is unusual. | there is a quite nice lounge with a tv and a computer for internet [although you can get wireless in your room], and a drinks machine for tea and instant coffee. | breakfast was in quite a dingy basement room- the staff were almost too attentive - felt a little rushed at times. limited choice [tea or coffee, 3 types of cereal, white toast and marmalade but no jam?, orange juice, and cooked breakfast consisted of only bacon, beans and egg] but again, i was not complaining at that price. the owners seemed very chatty with some of the regulars. | i agree with some of the other comments that i would rather the owners keep the place in this no frills condition at this price, rather than do it up and charge more. it is difficult to find anywhere clean or decent in central london, so this fits the bill. it might get a bit too basic if you were staying for a long time, but for a couple of nights it is great.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we stayed two times-during the same trip (visited ireland in between). the first visit was for 4 days-we are a family of 5 and got a room on the fourth floor. the room had a bunk bed, a single and a double-so lot of sleeping space. once we got all the luggage up, it was slightly cramped but ok. | pros: | 1. the location was great, near two tube stations, including paddington. | 2. there were enough restaurants , grocery store kind of places nearby. | 3. they let us keep 2 suitcases while we were in ireland. | cons: | 1.no elevators-we dragged our suitcases up and down the narrow stairs (4th floor) which was not fun. | 2. the breakfast was just okay-after 4 days-it can get to be boring...cereal, milk, toast, jam, fruits, and croissant...the varieties of cereal/croissant never changed. | 3. wifi in the 4 th floor room was not good at all but when we came back and was assigned a room one level below the ground floor-it was much better. | 3. the lady helping with the breakfast was friendly. others were not so friendly.'''",1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i heard about xenia from a co-worker as i have been staying at the marriott across the street for years and felt like a change (and, rather ironically, was getting tired of the small rooms). the xenia is a great location and looks fresh and clean, though the lobby has a very strong pumped-in perfume which some people might like but i found pretty over-powering. the good - the staff are friendly. not amazingly friendly (actually less so than across the street at the marriott where they are friendly and very helpful). the breakfast is very good and in a nice light room. the less good (okay, bad). the room i had is not fit to be sold as a hotel room. i am 5ft 10 and 190lb so i admit i am not the smallest person in the world but equally i am not the largest. i could just fit into the shower door. i could just fit my luggage in the room. the bed was just about big enough for me (i was traveling alone). the bathroom was tiny and totally impractical - no shelving, no space, no privacy whatsoever if you are not alone). i am marriott gold and they offered to call if another room was not available but they never did (six nights). i found the room oppressive and ridiculous and i know i will get a response about how there are lots of room types but that is not the point. this room is simply too small to be used comfortably.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the rhodes hotel is a great homebase for busy visitors of london. it is located right between two tube stations: paddington (circle/district lines) and lancaster gate (central line). it is also very clean and the staff were friendly. i am a woman traveling alone and felt very safe there and walking in the area. i also had access to a computer w/ internet (there is also a connection in every room). however, my single room was extremely tiny - which is to be expected in london for such a low rate (i paid 55/night). my biggest complaint was the lack of a lift. i was on the top floor and am in pretty good shape, but walking up all those stairs was a hassle! luckily someone helped me with my suitcase coming in, but no men were around the morning i left so i carried it downstairs on my own. nevertheless, i would recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a safe, convenient, and very clean place to stay while sightseeing in beautiful london.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''we stayed at the savoy as part of a trip to london and paris to celebrate my wife's birthday during september and we booked a river view king room. the hotel is beautiful and the location is perfect. the check-in was smooth and efficient and we were shown to our room (room 316). the room itself was spacious and comfortable. however the view of the river was completely obscured by a row of trees. when we raised this matter with the reception staff they said the trees were owned by the council and there was nothing the hotel could do about this. they said that during the winter months when the leaves have fallen there is a view of the river. we were happy with the room - our complaint was that we should have been told when we booked. if i book a room with a river view i expect to be able to see the river! | during our stay we enjoyed afternoon tea and a dinner dance both of which were wonderful. the food was amazing, the surroundings were stylish and the service was impeccable. first class. | we had asked for tea and coffee making facilities for our room and the room had a kettle and a coffee making machine with all the ingredients. we were disappointed that the cups were not cleaned or replaced during the turn-down service or when the room was cleaned. we asked at reception and also asked housekeeping if this could be done but without success. on one occasion when we returned to our room after dinner the contents of the bin had been emptied onto a half-round table which was next to the door. obviously the staff had meant to take the rubbish with them when they left but had forgot. when we complained they sent a maid who was clearly shocked when she saw the rubbish and apologised profusely but did not have a good enough grasp of english to understand our complaint about the dirty cups. not what we expected. if you have to do your own washing up perhaps they should provide rubber gloves and washing up liquid in the room. | all in all we enjoyed our stay and it was a shame that the service we enjoyed in the restaurants and public areas was not replicated in the rooms. as always it is attention to detail that marks out the really great hotels and on this occasion the savoy fell short.'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''i would give it a two-and-a-half star rating, were there such a thing as a half star on tripadvisor. | my wife and i stayed overnight in the world's biggest traffic jam, otherwise known as london, to visit my family. the dorchester was a hotel i was longing to try, as i belived it was possibly the best london had to offer, plus we regularly stay at hotels of the same group, and trust the brand. | after the initial excitement of seeing the famous art deco faade of the building, i was quickly underwhelmed when entering the jam-packed reception area and foyer. | the staff were trying to cope as well as they could with the amount of demands and request thrown at them, but were clearly short of personnel. they try to remain polite, but looked understandably stressed. | checking in at three of the clock, the receptionist was unable to tell me if our room was ready or not. he nervously dialed his phone no less than five times to try to reach houskeeping, but could reach no one. with an embarrased smile he suggested that we went to have a drink and came back in twenty minutes. fortunately we had reserved two spa treatment for that time and headed there directly. a good thing since the main foyer looked as hellish as harrods during the first day of sale. that is saying a lot. | we finally got the room. no upgrade, which i normally get when booking via amex platininum, but the hotel was full, so fair enough. | the room was an executive, supposedly the best category there is before suites. | well, i found it dark and dreary, overlooking the uggliest set of noisy pipes. the decoration reminded me of provincial english hotel of some twenty years ago, with brownish/beige heavy floral patern. there was not enough lights in the room, adding to the gloom, and due to the 30's archicture, there were lots of strange triangular angles. a feng shui's nightmare! | on the plus side the bathroom was vast and most attractive, with its very deep bath tub, seperate shower, and wonderful floris toiletries. | when shown into the room i was also offered tea, which was a nice touch. | we enjoyed the spa, and the treatments which were good. | i was not too keen on the main bar of the dorchester, which at about 6 of the clock doubles up as an after office-hour drinks, and fills with flash lads and girls who, though polyester-suited, boasted loudly to eachother about thier great success at work and in life in general. good for them! | late in the evening we went to the other bar, the china tang, which although very crowded, was good fun and looked like a 30's film set. the cocktails were marvelous, the service excellent | we then dined in the china tang. summed up, it is just another chinese restaurant, just three or four times more expensive. i did not enjoy my evening there. | so there we are; i left the dorchester with no more than a lukewarm impression, feeling that i had paid overall too much for what i got in return. the only two positive points of the place is its location, hard to beat, and the doormen/porters who did a fantastic job in finding cabs, when there were queues of people waiting. | next time, we will try the newly renovated savoy'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''saw a good deal on secret escapes but ended up booking direct with the hotel which all went fairly well, reservations replied to emails and were friendly and helpful while booking. check in was fine, we. like many others were offered 'the upgrade' which we politely declined. the hotel itself is rather beautiful looking but to be honest i felt seasick every time i was in it, that may have been by design but the air con and air quality in the hotel was oppressive (i have no idea if what we experienced was unusual or not). we felt that the air in the room was also very uncomfortable and we were desperate to get out into the fresh air along the river. neither of us enjoyed a good nights sleep. | we booked a superior room (might be worth paying extra for a river view) and i thought the room size was ok, amenities basic but ok, our tiny clock in the room had run out of battery, nice bathroom products. we had breakfast included which was extremely underwhelming. the cooked breakfast buffet was actually quite scary looking (the fattest, sweatiest sausages i have ever seen, i am so sorry but they were!) and the coffee was poor. on the second morning we did not even bother and had a nice relaxing breakfast at the globe instead. we had a drink at the downstairs bar on sunday night and the scottish girl greeting and seating everyone was absolutely lovely to everyone but then i chose a terrible cocktail and we both found the seating really uncomfortable so did not stay too long. we also visited the rumpus room on saturday night before heading out for dinner but it was not really our scene. from the hotel's location i would recommend a bike ride along to shoreditch/columbia rd, it was quite an easy ride and the roads were quiet over the bank holiday. | it annoys me a little to have to put this in a review, some simple questions on check out might have made me stop venting on a public forum and give some feedback on the spot, even simply a 'did you enjoy your stay' and 'thanks for choosing us' might have helped. do check out staff just not ask these questions anymore or is it just me? do they not care whether i return or not?! | look - i really wanted to have a great time and return but it was not meant to be. all in all, i left a little disappointed...but...it seems as though many others clearly love the place (i did also book off the back of some good reviews) so i must be the minority or had some bad luck.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''firstly, the positives. i understand the hotel has recently been refurbished, and the common areas and rooms are very clean and elegant. the staff are very welcoming and efficient,from door staff, front of house, and even cloakroom attendants! | however some of the finer details are not what you might expect. my feeling was that the elegance and luxury was a thin veneer and some of the basic hotel functions were not as they should be - the sort of things you would expect a travellodge to get right! | in my experience, my interconnecting rooms were not available to me until well after 5.30pm, when official check in time is 2.00pm - staff were very apologetic and did eventually sort out the various problems, but this was a real inconvenience. | i was travelling with my son and the hotel is not very welcoming for families - the only concession seemed to be a games console in his room (which he could not use until 5.30 when his room was finally made up) | the beds are very comfortable, but the basic rooms are small and the furniture is limited, ie, no easy chairs or area to sit. i would imagine the upgraded rooms and suites are better. | in addition to this there is no bar or lobby area where we could get a pre dinner drink as a family - no under 18 are allowed. so we were forced to go out earlier than planned and seek out a bar in covent garden, which was again, an inconvenience and lost business for the hotel. | i travel regularly and stay in various hotels. one of the highlights of my year is a stay in a luxury hotel in london, however, i will certainly not return to the savoy'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''over the few years i have stayed at the dorchester couple of times. this review reflects my last stay (december 2009) in the hotel. | all in all i found that in terms of service - whether it was concierge, waiters in the restaurants/bars etc.- everything was top-notch. even better than in my previous visits. | however, the check-in procedure was very strange and almost insulting for two reasons: | (1) i was told that as i had a debit/credit card (which for them was not a real credit card i was told) they will precharge the card with 200 pounds for hotel services. in the check-out they will refund the deposit. | (2) they also offered me a room upgrade if i pay some extra (i do not recall the precise sum). however, the difference would have exactly been the same if i had book the better room in the first place. | this was something new in the hotel as i did not experience it in my previous visits. i have travelled a lot in 5-star hotels and to be honest i found both of these precedures very unprofessional and especially precharging the card (after i had spent several thousand pounds on my previous visits to the hotel servoces) was insulting and showing that they do not trust you as a customer. | just to go to the claridge's and you truly feel a valued customer where a free room upgrade seems to be a standard procedure (and often to a lovely suite) and your not treated as a second class citizen in the check-in. | this small but an important incident is a pity as a really think that the dorchester is a high-class hotel where i would love to stay in the future. however, i am not sure if i would give the hotel another chance - this is up to the hotel management how they treat they customers in the future.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''loved the location and as mentioned by others, walking distance to harrods and major museums - in fact we walked to buckingham palace from there - did not take too long. 5 minute walk to the underground as well. on initial site of the hotel it looks lovely from the outside but as soon as you exit the lift to the floors it was like walking back in time to the 70s. we had a standard room and were expecting to pay for the area. room was small and dated with the worst bed i have ever slept in. my husband and i kept meeting in the middle every five minutes - awful roll together. breakfast was good. and staff pleasant. if you are looking for great location, then this is the place - if you are looking for modern and comfy bed - probably not - unless you upgrade to a bigger/better room - maybe the beds there are better!'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''my second stay here and the shine has slightly worn off from the chipped paint on the chain link sculpture outside to the somewhat brisk manor of the receptionist on check in - where i requested a river view and was told i had a room 'high up' i did not realise this meant the view was through a gap in the far side of the building. i would advise against odd numbers on the 14th floor for other visitors wishing to gaze upon the majesty of the thames. i was there for work and some of the personal touches extended to me as a business customer last time were sadly not replicated on this trip. frankly i may as well have stayed closer to the office. all that said the rooms are well appointed and the breakfast is good so if you can book a decent view and get a good price it is a nice choice for central london with al the excitement of south bank on your door step.''',1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''just did a 1 night stay at hotel xenia which is well located with 2 different tube stations in 5-10 min walking distance. i would love to rate this hotel very good but the rooms size makes that impossible. it is the smallest room i have ever stayed in was a classic double and there were 2 of us staying and we were falling over each other. bed is pushed right up against the window so you can only access by 1 side and bathroom just has a shower and small sink no bath. getting ready in the morning took co-ordination as both could not be out of bed and getting ready at the same time and then you have luggage as well. apart from room size the hotel is faultless, good facilities in room, very modern and very nicely decorated, comfy beds, lovely bar, did not eat in hotel so cannot comment on food and service was beyond what you would normally expect. just such a shame on the room size i would go again for 1 night if not planning to spend any time in room apart from sleeping but if you want a room to chill and space to do stuff or you are travelling with a lot of luggage then really this is not the hotel for you.... do not know if they have bigger rooms which they charge more for which may be better might be worth checking .....'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i have stayed here 2 times in the last 6 months. | the staff is pleasant. | the rooms are comfortable. | the location is perfect. | but if you are a business traveler and need the internet to do any sort of work, it is severely lacking. | i have a need to upload a small 200 mb file nightly and it would take almost 12 hours a night. i finally walked to starbucks and did it in an hour a day. | i stay in hotels weekly and this hotel is one of the worst when it comes to that. | this may not even be an issue for many travelers, and if it was not for me, i would add another star to my rating! | hopefully an upgrade in speed will come soon.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''went to the grill for lunch over christmas. food was ok, not stunning but acceptablei the special lunch menu lacked imagination and you felt forced towards the a la carte. wines were expensive and we were disappointed that you have to pay for drinks at the bar before leaving to go to the restaurant - hardly what you expect from a 5 star establishment. at just short of 100 a head it is not value for money.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel is not one of the cheaper 5 star hotels in london. the price we paid led me to expect a hotel experience like that of the connaught or the ritz, but our overall experience fell a good bit short of that. | first the good: our room we very good indeed. excellent in fact. it was the executive king: very well designed, with the bathroom across the little hallway from the bedroom and a nice walk-in wardrobe between them. plenty of space. the bed and the aircon were top notch and we had a good night's sleep. | the public spaces, however, were not as pleasing. when we first arrived i was struck by the dullness of the reception area. there was something soviet about its bland austerity. the northall bar is a very large, empty over-lit space which would be great for performing surgery on large animals, or even as a slaughterhouse, but for a bar it lacks charm. if only the bassoon bar were open all day, and not just in the evening, then guests would have a decent alternative watering hole. the crystal moon lounge has the potential to be like one aldwych in its hay day, which had a good mix of people and social buzz, but only customers taking afternoon tea can sit at the larger sofa groupings. this limits the mix of people as well as guests' choice of where to sit and, along with that, our feelings of belonging and experience of hospitality. | in short we found the public spaces charmless, for a host of reasons. we met friends there and we all commented on this and that the staff were often a little too stiff and not very happy. i wonder if they were understaffed and stressed? | the location of the hotel was good in that it was so central. but it is very difficult to find the hotel, which became a little irritating! the entrances need more than a few flags to help guests. a nice feature, perhaps, or an entrance canopy. | i feel i have been a little strict in this review. but if the hotel wants to charge over 500 pounds a night, it really has to be better than this.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''my husband and i stayed at the xenia in mid may ; i was attending a buckingham palace garden party with my daughter.i chose the hotel having seen advance publicity and booked a classic room. | i read the reviews about small rooms prior to our visit but was not at all prepared for what i found. | the hotel looks most attractive externally and the public rooms are comfortable and tastefully appointed.check in was straightforward and speedy . we were allocated 307 and i can fully understand the frustrion of the gentleman who stayed in 507 as one coold not swing a mouse let alone the proverbial cat. | as with the public rooms, decoration is tasteful: the tiny shower proved very good and the toiletries very nice but there the plus points end. i have rarely seen such a teeny tiny room for two people, we could barely both stand up at the same time and when our daughter joined us it was imposible. the bed had a tiny gap one side, right against the window not large enough to use to access that side of the bed and it was the most uncomfortable bed on which i have ever slept. i had to climb over the end of the bed to get in and slept extremely badly as the bed made my back ache terribly. however the bedding was good quality and the turn down service with very nice chocolates, was a pleasant surprise. | on the first morning , i showered and was wrapped in a towel and my husband in the tiny bathroom , when there was a knock on the door and i opened it sufficient to answer:it was the chambermaid asking when she could make up the room . it was 8.30!! i told her we would be going out by 9.30. | we did go out to have breakfast as we had not taken the option. as i had to change for the garden party, something which should have been fun , but was extepremely difficult in the minuscule space, we were back by 12.30 and the room , to my annoyance,had not been made up . i rang reception to infom them and to tell them about the maid disturbing our ablutions at 8.30 and they offered to send someone immediately , which would not have helped me in my task of dressing in the cupboard that was our room in the time available. | i spoke to the reception staff when i left for the palace and made it clear i was not happy about the maid knocking the door so early nor was i impressed by the fact the room was not made up nearly 5 hours later. | the refreshment supplies were also not replenished. | we had a second very disturbed night and left quite early the next day. | this is a hotel which is, like the curate's egg, good in parts. it is lovely to look at but there are staff issues and dreadful problems with the much vaunted samsung tablets in each room and with the wifi across the hotel;there was a queue of guests behind me also looking for help to operate the tablet or to access the wifi on their own ipads. wifi appeared to only work in the lounge.there is much room for improvement.and i was very shocked that our room was no bigger than a small single and the premier inns in which i have stayed offer vastly more space and genuinely comfortable beds. the classic rooms are to be avoided or at the least ask to see it before you accept the keys and request another room. | would i return ? only if i was prepared to pay for a much bigger executuve room or possibly to a twin room. definitely not to room 7 on any floor!! | the location is , however, excellent but nothing outweighs the tiny guest rooms and that, together with the maid incident, means i cannot say it is better that poor to average.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i stayed with my husband for a night as a birthday present i stayed in a deluxe double edwardian style which although was a lovely room which had a lovely bathroom and was reasonably spacious, left me feeling that the rooms were not worth the money i had paid and was more fitting of a standard double than a deluxe but saying this the room was very opulent, well kept and the bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept in, we did not have much of a view but this i could get over. | lobby was very beautiful as we are all public areas, had a look at the swimming pool which seemed very private and quiet although smaller than i had imagined and had a rather overpowering smell of chlorine.when we arrived guests are well looked after by staff, there seems to be more staff available than there are guests coming in and is very slick, possibly feels like their trying too hard which makes it feel slightly forced and ingenuine but there is no denying they work very hard to give the impression of luxurious living and to give each client a vip experience. | we went to the theatre and came back to the hotel for dinner, we first tried the grill which told us they were full, the man at the door was quite rude and a little bit above himself. | we then tried the river restaurant who dealt with us in a much better manner, they found us a seat at the bar whilst we waited for a table to become available, a cabaret singer began to sing and there was a very nice atmosphere by the time we finished our drinks a table in the restaurant became available and we sat for dinner. | this is unfortunately when our night and experience was spoiled in the hotel, as my husband is muslim we obviously do not eat pork, we made the waiting staff aware of this when ordering and made sure with them there would be no pork in our meals ect, anyway when the main course came out brought to us by a different waitress than who had originally served us and we began to eat another waitress quickly came and whisked away our plates and informed us that what my husband had started eating was actually pork and told us they would replace the plates immediately, we were slightly in shock ad we have been to numerous restaurants in our lives and a mistake like this has never been made, it is for us the worst possible experience that could happen in a restaurant and certainly did not expect it of a restaurant in the savoy. so my husband went to the toilet to throw up and by the time he had come back about 15 minutes later the replacements had still not arrived, we decided we felt quite uncomfortable and our appetite had gone we informed staff we would prefer to just leave and go to our room, we were spoken to by the manager who was full of apologies and dealt with us as we will as he could in that situation, i was rather upset as i had booked this night as a treat and had spent weeks planning which hotel to go to and to try to create a night that my husband would really enjoy and further weeks looking forward to the night when booked, and really could not be more embarrassed that this had happened to him, i am sure that this mistake does not happen regularly but at the same time it i would happen to us although to people who eat pork this may not seem like that serious an issue for jewish/muslim people it is the worst thing that can happen and it is a very serious mistake for any restaurant to make let alone a restaurant like this. when we got to our room we called the hotel manager who had been already informed and offer erred us room service for free and again was full of apologies there was another issue as the room service which was ordered at 11.30 did not turn up until 1.10am although being told at 12.30 tht it was in the lift and would be with us in minutes again the manager had to call us and apologise as apparently the prawns we had ordered were not in stock so i told him to send up the food without the prawns as we were rather hungry by this point again quite annoyed if the kitchen had just told us this it would not have been a problem but being codded along each time we called telling us the food was nearly there even though they had not even began cooking it again made another embarrassing mistake. | anyway after the restaurants mistake we were dealt with very well by the management we were also the next morning told we would have breakfast on them although i had actually paid for breakfast to be included with the room the gesture was appreciated we were also given a complimentary tea and chocolates which was very nice of them, the problem seems more to be with standard of service of the general waiting and kitchen staff as both restaurant managers and the night hotel manager dealt with us very well and really went out of their ways to amend the mistake and to make us feel on leaving that we had enjoyed our stay. | so in overview it is a beautiful hotel and mostly staff are very pleasant and as a customer you are made to feel important and well valued, restaurant prices are average for the area although the food is not to the level id expected, drinks prices are quite expensive but then it is the savoy. it is a nice treat to be in such opulent surroundings and feels very english, i personally do not think i would stay again i would try a different 5 star hotel in the area but it is all in all a memorable stay although for us we will always remember it for the fact that they served us pork unfortunately.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''as many of the reviews mention this is a very good hotel in many aspects,when you walk in you feel the professional conduct and welcoming of a well trained team.the lobby is of a very high standard of decor and is tastefully laid out. | my disappointments were in the room and here i expected more.as with much in life if you start seeing one or two negatives they seem to accumulate.first the room was very small 201 you can not open drawers and the position of the wardrobe behind the entrance door made in difficult to access.the room was very hot,i was unable to cool,it down so engineering came adjusted and then in the night it became too cold.the towels were hard and not soft as you would expected.my biggest issue was the comfort of the bed the pillows were very thin and although i stacked 3 i still felt uncomfortable. | i reported to management and they listened and offered options i moved rooms and did find the level of comfort and space better however i do compare to other london hotels and still have to say as a overall package the soho hotel for me offered a higher quality for the price....'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we stayed here for two nights because it was one of the cheapest but got good reviews on tripadvisor. we had a small double room at the back of the hotel on the second floor. no tea or coffee in the room but a free dispenser in the lounge. the lounge was a basically furnished room with no curtains or blinds at the window which did give it a bit of an unloved feeling. not a lounge you would want to spend much time in. there are no lifts so the breakfast room being in the basement it was 59 steps back to our room. not a problem for us but a consideration maybe for others. breakfast was all waitress served, juice, cereal, a small cooked breakfast followed by toast. the cooked breakfast was three items, one morning was egg, bacon and beans and the second morning egg, bacon and sausage. not huge portions but enough for us. the family and staff were all very friendly and helpful. it was very handy for buses to all parts of london and near the tottenham court road so easy walking to oxford street.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''my second time at the same hotel in 6 months and this time three nights for work. generally good but as usual the devil is in the detail. it took three different codes and two trips to reception to finally get onto wifi and then it requires a lenghty log on each time you want to use it. feels very disorganised and antiquated. | the safe in my room did not work so coud'nt lock my stuff away until it was fixed on the second day as waiting for the maintenance guy was making me late for work. surely the safe is checked each time the room is cleaned ? | room good, was very kindly upgraded, it is quiet, very well appointed plus a great range of toiletries. | i used the gym this time which was fine but the aircon did not seem to work which put me off on my second day. | food and service are good. | all in all fine but not as good as before and feels like things are slipping as is so often the case with british hotels. i will stay at the apex london wall again and would advise others to do so but it does need to be finessed.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i stayed at the mondrian for one night before a recent business meeting in the city. | the hotel dcor is very modern and minimalist, and fans of such interior design may love the mondrian, but to my old-fashioned eyes the room felt almost as if it had been given a coat of gray primer and just left that way. my main dislike of the mondrian is that not only the room interior but the corridors are also the same gray. i found the overall impression slightly depressing. still, the bed was very comfortable, and the hotel is generally very clean. | the hotel's location is very convenient for blackfriars rail station, and the underground station is on the other side of the thames, about a 5-minute walk. the hotel is on the thames embankment, so the front-facing rooms should be quite nice, but the majority of rooms are not on the riverside but face a quite dreary cityscape with not much of a view from the lower floors. fine for a one-night business stay but not much fun for longer. | the front-desk staff were very friendly and efficient. | i did not eat at the hotel restaurants. | i probably will not stay at the mondrian again, but only because i found the interior gray slightly depressing.'''",1
A To Z Hotel,"'''you can stay here only if you have budget constraints. the rooms are small. barely any space to move. the tube station is not close by although the bus stop is. hotel staff is helpful but the location is not great. you are too far away from central london on proper transportation, please budget enough travel time.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i have just arrived back from a lovely weekend in london | but the weekend was in some way spoilt by the hotel, we arrived on friday 2.00 pm usual friendly check in lovely snack in the bar great. a trip to the v &amp; a then dinner in the hawksmoor . lovely evening then our daughter who was joining us messaged to say her train was delayed by 3 hrs. so we checked her and our granddaughter in as she would not arrive until 1.00 pm reception said they would watch out for them,. so far so good i was kept awake all night by a strange noise in our room then at breakfast our daughter said they would not let her have her room key because we had checked them in so a poor welcome for them. | i complained about the noise in my room and was told it would be fixed for when we arrived back at the hotel. i arrived back after a busy day got to the room noise still there ! in fairness they did come and fix it so we changed went to dinner got back 10 ish for an early night to find the air con which was the because of the noise had leaked water into the room and was dripping all over the carpet i had to be quite firm to get anyone to take us serious eventually they sent someone to fix the leak an hour later we had a bed to sleep in . no real apology no real care . this was only part of there lack of customer service the rest just gets boring no flowers for my wife that were ordered for our anniversary the list goes on. not a good review .nothing to compensate for their mistakes pay up and move on . sad has we had used the hotel many times in the past.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''the ridgemount is fine by british budget hotel standards. | pros: | -the staff are very friendly and helpful, which says a lot. | -the lounge offers free internet, which is great | -the hotel is very clean | cons: | -front rooms facing gower street are very noisy due to traffic, sirens wailing at all hours. if you are a light sleeper, this can be a nightmare. at the very least, bring earplugs. better yet, get a room facing onto the back garden. | -the single rooms are tiny | -water pressure is a trickle. do not expect an invigorating morning shower. | i would stay there again, but only in a quieter back room.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''after visiting the theatre we decided as a family to pop into the savoy as a special treat for our eldest daughter who announced earlier that day that she was expecting her first baby. my father took me to the savoy hotel when i was expecting the same daughter that had announced her news, and thought i would carry on the same tradition as i had also taken my eldest son here when he had announced first arrival. how disappointed were we when we could not get a drink here. needless to say the tradition has now disappeared. such a shame.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we slept here for three nights, in a triple room not en-suite. the room had three beds and was quite large, with a basin. basic room but very clean. there was one toilet + one shower and a toilet with a tube. all quite clean but quite small and to be shared with our 6/7 rooms...they also have availability of en-suite room, for higher rates, but if i will come back i will pay for it. the difference is not too high. there is free internet wi-fi and also a pc in the lounge room to be used free by guests and also a library in case of need with guides of london and great britain. the owner are simply great, so nice people and so warm. every moment they had a good word or a suggestion. breakfast is served by very nice and kind waitress and is very good.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''having dined in the mondrian a couple of times, my partner and i decided to spend a night at the hotel to celebrate my 30th birthday. given the occasion, we requested a room with a view when we made the booking. while checking in, we were promised by the receptionist a room on the highest available floor with a view of the city and the london eye. | however upon entering the room, we found the only view on offer was an office block within 5-10m away with windows directly facing the hotel (see attached photo). the room was severely overlooked, and we had to keep the curtains shut at all times. we appreciate we did not book a superior room so we were not expecting a river view, but this view, or more accurately, this 'non-view' was far from being acceptable. | the room itself is tastefully decorated by drs/tom dixon, but it is small - okay only really for a single traveler or a couple staying for a night or two. the air-conditioning is very dry and rather uncomfortable. there is also no dressing gown or nespresso machine in the room, something you would expect in a 5-star hotel. on the plus side, the toiletries are fantastic - from malin + goetz, same with other hotels in the mondrian chain. | during our stay, we also checked out the gym and the spa in the basement. gym was well-equipped and quiet, which was a bonus. spa &amp; steam room was also decent - stylish and well-maintained. we did not get to visit the rooftop bar, the rumpus room, as it only opens between tue &amp; saturday, so we headed to the cocktail bar, the dandelyan, on the g/f instead. decor of the bar is trendy but elegant and classy. the cocktails were also delicious. | overall, we found the amenities - bar, restaurant, spa - of the hotel superb, but the rooms and the views (from the standard rooms) disappointing. service was professional and attentive, however we cannot help but feeling miffed about the fact we were misled by the receptionist that we were given a room with a good view.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed several weeks ago, over a weekend. disappointing to start with as were given the exact room we had asked to avoid! so an immediate move. sadly neither compared to pictures on the website. | first morning breakfast was nothing short of a bunfight ! we were shown to a table then left to work it out, not even drinks and toast brought to the table! it was quite busy. we were asked by a nearby lone diner if we would watch her food as she had to go back to the buffet. it transpired that she had already had everything she needed but left it tograb a coffee and on her return found everything cleared including her newspaper!! there seemed lots of staff milling around without purpose, and our expectations fell short. | next morning was entirely different! there was a suit greeting guests who was polite and helpful, we sat in the bar area which was much more pleasant. even the staff seemed more professional. what a difference a day makes?? | on the plus side, location is excellent for the tube and nearby restaurants. | the concierge are second to none. totally on it! shame the reception staff seem to lack that particular training. | so we are there again next weekend and wondering what we will find this time? hopefully the good, not the bad and ugly!'''",1

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''before arrival at this hotel we phoned up to request early check in around 11am.. we was told this would not be an issue. when we arrived they said check in is from 2.30 and they would phone us when our room was ready (we was promised before 2.30) at 2.30 we received a call to say our room was now ready. up on arrival, we was told they need a card for authorization.. little did they know they charged 60.00 from our card for ""extras"" which we was not told about. | we had 2 drinks from the mini bar in the room at additional cost. | when we went for breakfast (which was included in our package) we was told we could have anything off the menu and as much as we liked.. perfect!! | up on checkout they said ""just 2 drinks from the mini bar to pay 5"", which is no problem. a couple of days after checkout i notice they have charged 20 from my account, i phoned them to query this and they said 15 was spent on breakfast!! | we are now nearly 2 weeks after check out and the 60 ""authorization fee"" and the 15 breakfast refund still has not gone back into my account. terrible customer service from this hotel after phoning twice today and being told someone will call me back. | other than this the hotel is lovely and clean.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed here just to see what this very new hotel had to offer....sorry to say that it had more to offer in the way of style rather than practical, comfortable accommodation! check in was rather difficult - the staff were having trouble both finding reservations and cutting keys. then on to the room - my ""superior"" was a very cold monochrome affair - the queen sized bed was being sold as a king size which was annoying. the windows were small, the ""wardrobe"" was a curtained off rail, the bathroom was in fact a wet room with a walk in shower and no bath - ok, that is not unusual, but why provide robes and candles with no bath? also the room was plenty big enough for a bath with lots of room wasted on a very large bench with a single hand basin on it! the bed was very comfortable and the linens were good quality - also the towels were enormous - a big plus. but the whole was a rather disappointing experience - an armchair that looked funky but was uncomfortable, a very small table and chair serving as ""desk"" and windows that were tiny - a shame given that there were river views to be had. room service was late - promised in 30 minutes, chased after 60 minutes and delivered in 80 minutes - just not good enough! check out was another painful experience - this time the desk clerk telling me he had no way to produce a vat receipt! the riveted copper faux ship hull is an imposing design statement at reception - but that is all this hotel offers....less of the design and more thought and customer service please !'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i got afternoon tea at the dorchester as a christmas gift from a relative. i have had a couple of afternoon teas before in london and this was quite frankly poor. the location, interior and service were excellent. the sandwiches were ok as was the tea. the deserts and scones however were really average. it seems trivial but the jam for example was really runny so provided difficult to use on the scones. a lot of the deserts were not really that sweet and to be honest nowhere near what i expected. i had better deserts at a hilton double tree afternoon tea once. it is worth a visit but not as good as i had expected. the ritz for me is still by far and away the best afternoon tea in london.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''should have dug deeper when booking. it wound up being a 5th floor walk up (difficult with luggage). although clean, it was very outdated (e.g. rust and water wear on the fixtures). | if you are on a budget in london, and only looking for a place to lay your head, this is a good option. if you are interested in more updated accommodations, keep looking. | the locale is great. a block from paddington station. it was easy to catch the heathrow express to the airport. | staff was nice. breakfast was average; nice to have it included.'''",1

45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''this is the 4th time i have stayed at 45 park lane hotel. in past 3 times service was good but this time overall service is not too good. each night is $900 pound not cheap at all. staff knock on door and rush into your room without waiting for response, room is not clean after return to my room in the afternoon, you always has to wait till 3pm to check in get your room, | if your flight arriving early in the morning do not use this hotel. if you check in time | is in the evening then it is ok as they do offer late check out. | breakfast is always enjoyable for me. love to have breakfast at hotel. it is easy to walk around, lots bar, resturants around and a nice bakery coffee shops around corner. hotel is in a high class business residence area. taxi cue up in front of hotel ready to go which is very nice . | king bed is kind of hard for most people but it is ok for me but the pillow is too soft it disappearing on you even stack two of them. | house keeping does not always refill your coffee capsules and only offers 3 per day. kind of piss me off when you run out of coffee by 10am and they do not refill coffee capsules at afternoon like other hotel. do not understand for 900 offers little coffee capsules is stupid. house keeping is amazing slow to clean the room. they also push wrong time to turn your bed. slipper size is for small feet only better bring your own. they do not offer any power adaptors in your room so bring your own.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''i had enjoyed staying at this hotel four years ago, but i think it will be longer before i return. | the staff were friendly enough, but ignored my request for a quiet room, allocating me a front facing one (405) which sounded as if the windows were not tight in the frames, and allowed some traffic noise and external air-conditioning sounds into the room at night. the heating fan also made a loud clicking when it turned itself on and off. | there was some discolouration of the grouting on the shower floor, which spoiled the general impression of the bathroom. | i am quite used to having a swipe of the credit card taken by hotels, but less well disposed to having 60 taken from my card which i was told would be returned in 3 -4 days. i visited various shops while i was in london where i made no purchases. happily, the retail trade does not follow the same (sharp) practice. | otherwise, the room was comfy and well-equipped. it was ok - on offer.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i have just returned from a three-night stay at the dorchester and found the hotel, whilst undoubtedly very good, fell short of expectations. | let me begin by saying that the staff were all excellent. everybody we dealt with was polite, professional and friendly. my girlfriend and i were usually greeted by name and room service was always quick and courteous. | my main gripe is the blatant avarice of the hotel's owners. now, i know that other top flight hotels adopt similar practices but there are much more affordable places to stay which offer such facilities as full satellite television (the dorchester offers a very limited selection of channels), complimentary wifi (19.50 per day here) and a complimentary minibar (3.50 for a packet of crisps, when i have just paid 450 for the room? really?) as a matter of course. | further to this, the room service menu states that a delivery charge of four pounds would be added to each order. i assume that this surcharge does not reach the waiter, who is probably on not much more than the national minimum wage, so it is most rapacious of the hotel's owners to exploit customers in this way. i would rather not have to pay a delivery charge and tip the waiter in cash. | at least they notify you in advance that you will be charged for room service. at check-in, the hotel informed me that as well as the total cost of the room, they would be taking an up-front fee of 200 per night to cover room service and other charges. i would have had no objection had i been forewarned of this, but no mention of this policy was made at any point during the reservation process. | as far as the hotel is concerned, the public areas are all of a high standard and the promenade bar, in particular, stands out. all food and drink was of a high standard but our room, whilst spacious and with a beautifully appointed bathroom, had a few minor flaws, ill becoming of such a prestigious property: not one of the lampshades in our room was correctly aligned; the docking station for ipods was so worn that it would only play if the device was physically held in place; there was dust on one of the bathroom shelves; the television was not correctly formatted, so that widescreen broadcasts reached beyond the parameters of the screen; the fruit bowl was not replenished on a daily basis. | overall, i would say that the dorchester is a fairly average five-star hotel and doubt that i will be going back there.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we booked 2 rooms at very good rate via internet, but once we arrived became victims of extremely well organized ""upsell scheme"". of course we could have gotten our two rooms without extra fees, but not on a same floor (we travel with kids) and facing construction site.. we have paid more originally to have deluxe rooms, but how do you argue what ""deluxe view"" means.. after nice ""presentation"" we paid $1,500 extra for 3 nights for the junior suit with very nice river view and magically connected second room.. otherwise i would end up looking for my kids 3 floors down.. | waiting to be checked in - i heard similar pitch to each visitor, literally! everyone was given a construction view and then being ""upgraded"" for a fee of course. that is how their selling policy works i guess. | other then that - not much to do in the hotel except eat and drink. spa was tiny with a single steam room. movie theater - you had to pay extra and .. that is it, which is a bit weird for such large hotel. | the bright spot was breakfast buffet. that was a great deal. excellent food in abundance for not much money. location is ok.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''currently staying in the hotel for 6 nights, so far it has been relatively good, room is a decent size with a large comfortable bed, shower has good pressure and temperature. as this is a new hotel i can appreciate a few things might be off and what i have experienced so far is that a lot of the staff are not aware of procedure, for example this morning i was told i had the english breakfast included which meant that i could have from the continental table and any eggs from the menu. this seemed to have changed from monday when i was told that i could only have eggs, pretty confusing! another poor part was that i ordered a whiskey in the bar on monday night and was given a cracked glass. all in all this is a good new hotel that just needs a few of the finer details ironed out.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this was not our first time here as the rooms are really superb, and this time was no exception. | however they have the sharp practice, that i thought had all but disappeared in london of adding 12.5% service charge and then leaving a space to add tips. we accidentally added tip on top of service in the bar until we realised. it should be illegal as there is no legitimate reason except the hotel trying to take more money. | the other issue is the breakfast which really is budget hotel quality. the choice is small, the quality poor and its 20 per head. for the privilege of pointing you to the buffet, refusing to make toast and pouring from a flask of stewed tea they also add 12.5% service! | this could be such a great hotel but they let themselves down.'''",1
The Dorchester,'''yesterday went to one of their afternoon champagne teas with a group of us celebrating a 60th birthday . tea was ok as well as service. however the extras were cunningly added on. we had glass of champagne and my daughter and friend wanted coffee they were encouraged to have another champagne which was implied that it was same price as coffee but it was not. the champagne was flowing freely implying we were finishing a bottle but every glass was a price. this was a rip off and the waiters knew how to do this and really they should have let us know that champagne was extra and not just replacement for coffee at same price. anyone going here ask prices or better still maybe keep tab on your bill!!!!!'''',1

45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''good afternoon mr. ronson we have been expecting you - was the unexpected yet pleasant greeting i received from the doorman of the newly opened 45 park lane as i told him my name while handing over my luggage upon arrival at the hotel. | | opened just three days ago on september 1st, 45 park lane is the latest addition to the dorchester collection and is appropriately located on the adjacent block to the original dorchester hotel - in park lane, london. | | i have fond memories of the dorchester where i spent one summer working in their pastry department, while still at college during my earlier years training to be a chef. at a pinch, you could say i am an ex employee. | | although check-in time is officially 3pm, my wife and i were anxious to get settled into our accommodations, and so took a chance at arriving a tad early. we were nicely surprised when the receptionist said we could be roomed, and graciously escorted us to the 3rd floor, where our room 4533 - was located directly opposite the elevator - hmm i thought as we arrived at the door. however, just before leaving the lobby, our host explained that their signature restaurant ""cut"" by wolfgang puck - whom we had just missed as he was there for the opening - was having his first foray into europe with this establishment - and suggesting we give it a try. i told her that we would been to his premiere restaurant - spago in la - thanks to some friends of ours, so likely we would give this one a miss. she also pointed out that just up the stairs was what promised to be london's latest hangout - their lounge bar. | | incidentally, all rooms are numbered 45xx where 45 is the hotel name, and the next two digits relate to the floor and room number. | | just as our host was about to open the door, a housekeeper popped her head round the corner and said that the cleaner had not quite finished, and that the room would be another few minutes, politely suggesting we go away and come back. | | so, ushered back into the elevator we proceeded to the lobby and entertained with some complimentary drinks. i must say this unfortunate incident was well handled, and honestly speaking, i preferred to wait for the room to be fully ready, rather than go in, and as i often do - find faults. | | the surroundings in which we waited were very pleasant. the lobby is nicely appointed and has several interesting art deco objects intermixed with very comfy connolly leather chairs that gave-off a wonderful new luxury car smell. | | after about 10 minutes, a host approached us and further apologized for the delay - saying they have a few tech issues with the room and need about another 20 minutes to fix them. we agreed that would not be an issue - although my intrigued peaked as to what they could be. | | finally the time came to go to the room, and we were once again escorted - this time making it though the door into the spacious and luxurious surroundings. | | one of the first things of note apart from the welcome fruit amenity complete with a banana and some figs, and a huge wall mounted b&amp;o tv, was the temperature of the room - which i personally found to be uncomfortably hot. incorrectly believing that could quickly be addressed later, we proceeded with the check-in process and small tour of the room facilities. | | as part of the rooming process, pointed out to us were the three alcatel-lucent touch screen phones - one on each side of the bed and another on the desk, and how one would use these to basically control all of the tech functionality in the room - a/c, curtains, lights. this was going to be fun i thought. then i was shown where the teleadapt connectivity panel was (not the cables), plus the safe and hair dryer. also pointed out was the mini-bar and nespresso machine - at which point we were asked if we would like to have a coffee - i declined the offer. | | we thanked the host for her assistance and she left, saying she could be contacted by phone if required. the luggage arrived quickly, and finally we were on our own. it was now time to analyze the room. | | first thing first, was to try and cool the room down - and by using the touch phone which is interfaced to the control4 room control system and lutron lighting system, i adjusted the required temp to 20c from where it was being unbelievably indicated as 59c. | | next on my mental to-do list, was to walk through the room exploring the different facilities, while taking photos as a permanent record. | | the first discovery was a most pleasant one - the mineral water and fruit juices in the minibar were supplied with the hotel's compliments. however, the coconut water - my real favorite, was not. it is a pity that that wooden door attached to the front cover of the mini-bar would not close properly after opening. never mind i thought, the housekeeper will discover this during turn down service and fix it. | | next was the surprise of finding of an unsecured inspection panel covering the room control system - the brains controlling the room. this was a fascinating discovery and the photos will show you just how much investment was made into this complex system. and it was at this juncture where i had to ask my wife to take a look at this discovery and see for her self what i had found - not just the open door, but also the builder's rubble on the floor and left over cable shielding and various miscellaneous pieces of rubbish. although it is not the first time for me to find such a mess at a newly opened hotel, i was quite surprised as the room was otherwise very clean. after all, they had already been open for a few days before we checked-in, the room was cleaned after being handed back by the contractors, and then i understand there was a 2-week simulation period where the room should have also been used - i think, as well as snagged/critiqued and cleaned - anyway, more on that later. | | next up was the bathroom - complete with double vanity, separate wc with mobile phone shelf, shower and nice sized bathtub. pity we were not to have enough time to enjoy all of the facilities. the (electric mirror) bathroom tv was a nice touch and the mood lighting worked well. absent from the vanity area of the bathroom was a hook where i could hang my wash bag - so i was forced to suspend it from the illuminated shaving/makeup mirror - not really a great option - just more out of desperation. | | click here for photos | | thinking about working in the room, i then setup my notebook on the desk and connected it to the concealed power sockets - they did not work. i tried a couple of other devices, alas with same result, so i stretched my power cable to the connectivity panel embedded into the side unit under the tv - they worked. the power socket arrangement at the desk is interesting; there are two gb sockets, one us 125v socket and one european type connection. oh yes, there is also a fax port. do people still use fax? | | for some reason i could not connect to the wi-fi - but was able to get online with the wired connection at the desk. so i just created my own wi-fi network by sharing the ethernet connection from my macbook pro. the hotel has a strange charging policy - 24hours = gbp19.50, but you can get a free 1-month connection with 192kbps (see screenshot), so i opted for the free one. no one explained the difference, or limitations. i was just happy to save the twenty quid. | | the tv worked well - with quite a few ftg channels, and a fairly good selection of ppv movies and on-screen internet - all of course chargeable through the ibahn etvi system. | | it was now time to go out and meet some friends across town - so we went back to the lobby and i reported three things at the reception desk: | 1. temperature | 2. mini-bar door | 3. desk power | i do not recall the lady apologizing when i mentioned these, just saying they would send an engineer - and we left. | | returning around 11pm, we stopped off for a quick nightcap in the 1st floor bar, and then headed up to the room. i noticed some of the executive management was also there taking a late supper. my wife was treated to a comp sip of locally distilled vodka, which the barman explained was made just round the corner. nice touch, and the almonds were delicious. | | arriving at the room door, i inserted the key in to the lock only to have it rejected, i tried again - same problem so i tried the 2nd one - no luck. so we headed back down to reception for a new key - lucky our room was by the lift, and it was only three floors to reception, which was also situated just by the lift on the ground floor. the lady receptionist said i must have placed them near my mobile phone or credit cards - which i had not, but even if i had done so - they should not have become unusable and she should not have chastised me for doing so. oddly, as she was just about to cut the new keys, she asked me for my room number, although it was clearly written on the key cardholder i gave her. i guess she was just flustered... | | so, back to the room we went, this time escorted by another host just to make sure we could get in, and all was good. | | by this time the room felt a bit cooler, but still warm. the room had been serviced and a small plate of chocolates left for us. i do not eat chocolates but my wife said they were nice - so that is ok. | | a single bottle of water and glass was placed on one side of the bed, yet there were two of us - i guess we were meant to share.... | | the mini-bar door had been fixed, but when we opened it to get a bottle of cool water - the same issue happened with the door - meaning there must be a design defect. | | power had been restored to the sockets at the desk, as well as and the illuminated vanity mirror built into the desk, so an engineer had definitely been to the room - but he had not closed the floor inspection panel by the desk. i later noticed that some of the rubbish materials left by the inspection cabinet had been removed - some that is, not all. | | getting into bed, and figuring out how to control the lights and other services was very difficult. often the buttons were non-responsive when depressed, and when they did work - the response time for the actual function to take place, was fairly delayed. one time, the desk unit auto re-booted with the process taking about three minutes to complete as it cycled through the six-stage process. | | one of the things i could not work out, was how to just switch on the desk lamp, and no other light - allowing me to work during the night, while not disturbing my wife. i also could not figure out easily how from a totally darkened room, how to just switch on a low light to get to the bathroom. i guess i should have just used the reading light affixed to the side of the bed. | | during the night, there were several odd sounds in the room - like clicks and beeps, which we think were emanating from the emergency broadcast speaker - but could not be sure. we both heard it, and remarked about it after waking in the morning. | | still trying to cool the room down, i played with the wall mounted control panel, only to discover that although the day and month were correct, the year showed 1972. looking at the phone, which should have had the same information, the date and time were correct - how bizarre! | | the nespresso machine worked well, although my wife could not have her usual green tea in bed since there was no kettle. she had to settle for plain water. | | taking a shower was very pleasant - although a little unusual. the water pressure was good, and oversized amenities nice - excuse us, but we took the excess with us. but what we both noticed was the very soft water and how it was difficult to know if you had actually removed all the soap - ones skin just felt so smooth. i guess we are just used to hard water in asia. | | all good things must come to an end, and it was time to check out - so we headed downstairs. i asked my wife to take a seat again in the nice comfy leather chairs while i handled the formalities. during the checkout process there appeared to be some problem printing a copy of my folio, and while that was taking place, i was approached by a lady standing in front of the reception counter who graciously, yet embarrassingly (for me) introduced herself as marie-laure akdag - hotel manager. | | somehow i guessed this was who she must be, and frankly hoped she would not want to have to long discussion due to the preceding experience of what had happened upstairs. anyway, when she asked if we had enjoyed our stay i simply replied, ""it was interesting"", and did not go into detail. of course, she could not have asked if we would stayed there before, but did inquire if we would be returning, to which i replied, ""that may be a possibility..."" and we left it at that. | | date of stay - 3rd/4th september 2011'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''hotel is in a very good location, price a bit high for what you get. the rooms were neat and clean. | the hotel's staff was nice and polite easy to deal with. the service at the bar was a bit difficult to deal with when asked for separate checks.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''overall we had a solid stay at the rhodes hotel. it is a very basic, but clean, bed and breakfast/walk-up type hotel. it is in a very quiet neighborhood right near hyde park. it is a perfect place to stay when coming in from heathrow. it has an apartment type feel with no lift/elevator and a few flights of stairs. the front desk and owners are very helpful and one of the few places that offer 3-4 beds per room. it was perfect for a few buddies on a trip to london. a few frustrating aspects that could be improved are the wi-fi on the 3rd or 4th floor was very spotty and inconsistent. the shower water pressure was mediocre as well. if you are looking for a quiet, modest, clean place to stay in london that will not break the bank this is a great option.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''hotel is a classic, however lacks a decent quality price ratio. | i would put this down to the fact the savoy has lost its grandeur since it is now owned by a large global chain, such timeless hotels tend to be better when owner managed as a family business. you feel the strong undertones of a bland ""chain"" hotel. | no real wow factor sadly.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''we went to the savoy for a special occasion but wished we would chosen somewhere else. it is a stunning hotel and the room was beautiful but then again, so are many hotels in london. there were also human hairs in our bath when we arrived - cleanliness is a basic requirement of any hotel, surely! | we arrived in time for check in and were told our room would be ready in 15 minutes or so. 2 hours later, we were finally led up to our room and that was only after my partner complained about the wait. up until that time, we were left waiting in the lobby and promised the room would be ready soon. judging by the many people who were also hovering around, there were many people had the same issue. | the hotel should not advertise a check in time it cannot keep to, and certainly not at the prices it charges. the 5 star service was nowhere to be seen so i suggest saving your money and going elsewhere!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at this hotel whilst attending a concert at the royal albert hall. it is very convenient and no more than 10mins walk. nicely situated in kensingto and lots to do and see in the surrounding area. street cafe's etc. hotel is a very typical london hotel. supreme room was more like a large wardrobe, barely enough room to get around the bed let alone swing a cat. ensuite was big enough for a small child. not quite my interpretation of supreme. breakfast was very average with standard boring fare being offered. waiting staff seemed to to nothing but argue with each other in various laguages other than english. probaly would look for alternatives in the future.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''every 6mnths we travel to london. we stayed in a junior suite at the savoy. unfortunately it was not a good experience. we erroneously entered through the riverside entrance and were ""vaguely pointed in the direction of the reception"" by a member of staff who was neither polite nor professional. at reception we had to wait a long time to be seen. the room was nice, but small for a suite. the bathroom was tiny with no his/hers sinks and a tiny bath that was not big enough for my husband. we had to ask three times for a cot for our room. small issues but the room was not cheap so we expect a high standard. it is the small things that make a difference. there are much better hotels in london for the same price. sorry. very disappointed.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''rooms were spacious enough | bed quality was ok | small bathroom and toilet. ok shower in bad | room was noisy... inside and outside noise. constant loud hum of technical installation. | wifi slow... not for streaming | breakfast very poor quality with stale croissants... | service was friendly. | prices high, but normal for that area of town. | not at all impressed by this hotel'''",1
The Savoy,"'''was in london for business for one night, so thought i would give this one a try. | its a spectacular building for sure, but not sure i would stay again. i will probably go back to my usual london hotel next time. | first of all, i walked up to the door with bags (no help with bags), through the foyer (no help), asked the concierge where to check in, who indicated the room on the far side (but no help) and finally stood in the check in area for 15 minutes while the only 2 staff struggled to check in large parties. i did not expect to wait that long to check in, in one of supposedly the best hotels in london. finally the check in clerk noticed my luggage and asked if i had come in via the river entrance (as clearly someone should have got my luggage off me before getting so far). i told her i would walked in the front door and right through with luggage. she left it at that with no further comment, but clearly someone should have assisted me. | anyway, no worries. room was beautiful and spotless, even if slightly old fashioned for my personal taste. i asked the staff where the residents bar was and was pointed to the american bar. i tried twice to go for a drink in my hotel bar, but failed both times due to huge lines (15 to 20 minutes wait) of non-residents waiting to go in for a drink. in my opinion this is ridiculous. your paying top dollar to stay in a high end, and you cannot get a seat in the bar due to non-residents being given priority. a cardinal sin in my opinion. i tried again on returning from dinner with business contacts about 11pm, and same again! no room at the inn! i was pointed down some steps to get a drink in a foyer area, but if you think i am paying 350+ a night to drink in the annex your mistaken. | so thanks savoy. beautiful building, but it will be a while before i return.'''",1
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''we stayed for a trip to the royal albert hall. the hotel is conveniently sited near hyde park underground and about a mile's walk to rah. | the reception staff were a little condescending and had a slightly superior air about them, they also tried to sell us a ""unique offer"" of an upgrade but we had seen the same offer on the starwood website cheaper! | the room was nice, clean and a fair size and the bed was comfortable. | the ""butler"" arrived five minutes after we did but did not really show us anything in the room....odd. | the bar downstairs is very small and there is an overflow area outside, which is heated, but a little incongrous. | breakfast was in a small room and even though there were only 5 other people in the restaurant - all of whom had finished their breakfast, the restaurant staff managed to take ages to serve us. when the breakfast was eventually served one dish was not properly cooked and we sent it back, it came back again nearly 25 minutes later, still undercooked. by this time we had run out of appetite and patience - breakfast having taken over an hour and 20minutes. they did not charge us after we complained, but we would rather have had a nice breakfast. | we almost certainly will not go back and would not recommend it to anyone. there are much better hotels in london - the mandarin oriental is down the road and that was very good last time we stayed there.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''the room looked aged and nothing special. the wardrobe and bedside table looked dilapidated. i must say the room looked neat though. the staff look very unsatisfied with the job. and for the price , i think it should have been cheaper. travel lodge is by far better and cheaper. the breakfast is fantastic and many varieties. that is the only reason i gave it 3 stars'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed there one night last saturday and booked spa treatments called | "" stiletto smoother "" - i was expecting something better then a pedicure but unfortunately it was rushed and at best below average treatments for price well above a luxury perdicure at most london spa's. it was infact so rushed that colour was smudged as there was no nail dryer around. i use some quality spa's all over the world as i travel a lot but i was not happy with treatment. spa itself was spacious and clean. | room was ok, a bit small for the price. room service breakfast was good. shower was good too. i do however feel for the price i could have managed a better place in london as there is so much choice around.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we are a not experienced travellers and given the reputation of the savoy we were a little surprised with bath robes that were like sandpaper a mini bar that you would need a mortgage to drink from, luggage that went missing for an hour, being charged for 3 glasses of wine with dinner when we only had 2. moan over. there were parts of the stay where we were treated very well. the staff all knew our names and were extremely helpful.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''the savoy is an english institution, but this should not allow them to charge whatever they want. the place is a bit dated and not as swish as some might expect. i did like the place, but the price tag paid, was nowhere near what i received in return. the staff in this place are simply fantastic though, so whoever is in charge of staff hiring, is obviously doing his/her job very well.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i spent 9 days at the savoy in january 2011. the hotel looks beautiful following an extensive renovation, and my room on the seventh floor was impeccably appointed and very comfortable. that said, there were numerous problems with my stay, in particular the performance of ""the reception team"" (the hotel's term) and the housekeeping staff. although some of the problems were minor, others were not---and in the aggregate, there were far too many of them for a first class hotel charging commensurate prices (i paid approx. $650 per night for a deluxe room---not including meals or incidentals). | day 1. i arrived at the savoy in the late evening. the member of ""the reception team"" who escorted me to my room mentioned that i had a one night reservation. i told her that information was in error and provided her with a copy of the reservation from the us travel agency that handled the (prepaid) booking. the following morning, i received a letter from ""the reception team"" stating that the 8 night reservation had been confirmed. | day 2. the key card for my room did not work. i went to the lobby to meet with a member of ""the reception team,"" explained that i was locked out of my room and had the key reprogrammed. | day 3. my other key card did not work---locked out of the room again, so i made another trip to ""the reception team."" while the key was being reprogrammed, i was told that the problem was that the two key cards had not been updated when my reservation was amended, which begs the question---why did not ""the reception team"" realize that the key cards would need to be reprogrammed when my reservation was revised to reflect the correct length of my stay? their failure to make that connection meant that i was locked out of my room not once but twice. on the same day, i called room service to order a bucket of ice and was told it would be delivered in approximately 10 minutes. the ice was delivered 45 minutes later, after i called room service for the second time (i later learned that the hotel charges for ice--at a cost of 2.25 pounds per order). | day 4. in the early morning, a copy of the bill for my stay was slipped under my door, along with a letter of inquiry as to how i intended to handle my luggage in connection with checking out of the hotel. so i had to pay another visit to ""the reception team"" to remind them that my reservation was for 8 nights---not 1 night, not 3 nights, but 8 nights. i explained to a member of ""the reception team"" what had happened since my arrival, expecting that she would take the hint and offer some sort of gesture for the inconvenience caused by the hotel's errors---what i received in return was a series of polite apologies, which by this point was no longer sufficient . i then called the agency in the us that handled the savoy reservation and asked them to contact the hotel---several minutes later, i received a call from the assistant manager of the savoy (who had just taken a call from that travel agency). the assistant manager (whose first name was ryan, and he impressed me as very professional and sincerely apologetic) asked how the hotel could make amends---i received complimentary drinks at one of the bars at the hotel, which i appreciated. unfortunately, the problems continued. when i returned to my room at 2:30 pm after having been away for more than 7 hours, the room had not yet been cleaned. i called housekeeping and asked that the room be cleaned in the late afternoon (i suggested 4:15 to 4:30), as i wanted to do some work in my room until then without being disturbed---i was told that would be no problem. the maid arrived to clean my room at 3:15, well before the requested time. | day 5. housekeeping removed a bottle of hair conditioner from the shower stall and replaced it with a bottle of body lotion. note to housekeeping: while the bottles of conditioner and lotion may look similar, they are not the same... | day 6. i returned to my room at 9:00 pm after a day trip outside of london and noticed that there was no sign of turndown service. as i was tired after a long day, i elected not to call housekeeping to remind them about turndown service. i was awakened at 9:25 pm by a maid who asked if i wanted turndown service. turndown service at close to 9:30 pm?! | day 7. newspaper was not delivered. | day 8. the one day of my stay in which there were no incidents. | day 9 (checkout). the previous evening, i had requested a porter to pick up my bags at 6:30 am. as i had made that request in person with a member of ""the reception team"" while settling my bill, it was clear as to which room was the subject of my request. on the day of my checkout, the porter did not arrive at the designated time. at 6:35 am, i called the concierge --- after 6 rings without an answer, i hung up and took my bags to the lobby. in the lobby, i encountered a member of ""the reception team"" and advised that the porter never arrived for my bags---as it turned out, the porter had been instructed to go to a different room on the same floor (room 712 instead of room 723)---another mistake by ""the reception team."" i hope the guest in room 712 was not too offended by the unexpected wake-up call. | long story short: a beautiful hotel, but at these prices it is reasonable to expect quality service from the staff---an expectation that was decisively not met.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''occasionally i like to splurge on an obscenely expensive hotel, and this time it was the savoy. | point 1 savoy.... just because i arrived on foot having got the tube to charing cross, this does not make me a suspicious undesirable. i should not have to justify myself to every doorman and bellboy before i get to check in | point 2.... i think 3:30 is a reasonable time to check in. if the room is not ready at this point, please invite me to take a drink in one of the bars or other public areas. do not send me away to mooch around covent garden awaiting a phone call | point 3.... a window that closes is always a plus for me. that way, you do not get woken up at 6:00 by every passing tradesman. | point 4.... vat!!! do not play silly beggars. to quote prices exclusive of vat is not normal and smacks of deception | point 5.... when i bring these points up directly, my idea of a resolution is not the promise of an upgrade the next time i visit. so the only way i can get any recompense is to spend another small fortune.... | i know the savoy do not give a toss about tripadvisor reviews.... the tone of any mail i have had from them has been ""so, do your worst sunshine. we are the savoy. end of!!""'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''first of all i must say, not all of it was bad - but seriously, 4 stars? | i arrived quite late in the evening, after a long flight from the you.s. was met by a rather arrogant young girl at the front desk, will not go in to details, as it got sorted out by management later on. otherwise very friendly and attentive reception staff. | the room itself was spacious - i had a club room on the 2nd floor, facing the v&amp;a. could of course hear the traffic noise, but was not very bothered. the stank of cigarette smoke from downstairs did on the other hand bother me, this was of course on the street, and not the hotel's fault - although they could advise their guests not to smoke right outside of the front doors. although the room was a bit ""worn out"", it was spotless at every time - except from one time when i found that the maid probably had washed the wine glass under the tap, and just let it dry up - i am not sure of this, but it certainly looked like it. i did not complain about it, as i still felt very uncomfortable after the episode when i arrived at the front desk. bathroom also seen it better days; but spotless, and lovely, lovely soft towels! | i quite enjoyed the room service, lovely food - i especially appreciated that the breakfast was included in the rate. again, one bad experience: waiter insisting on me having ordered two sets of breakfast for room service - which i obviously had not. i think he became a bit annoyed and wanted to take it all out again, but then i would be late for my meeting, so... again, a bit uncomfortable. | all in all, not too bad - have definently seen worse, but in this price range i would expect the little extras. will not come back at this point ( i think the girl the first night, pretty much ruined it ) - i prefer staying at the number sixteen...'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''one of the best stays, i request you if you you had any problem directly go and speak to mr. dixon uko (the duty manager). he is welcoming and takes action for any problem which occurs.the concierge person who was responsible is one of the beat people i have ever met. the worst thing that i have ever faced when we started checking out the person who took our luggage from the room was a trainee person named stepahne, he was so rude and unprofessional but mr. dixon uko took an immediate action of what happened. | thank you so much. | ohood bin haider'''",1

"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''while the wellesley is an extraordinary renovation, with beautiful rooms, it suffered when i was there from the smell of cigar smoke throughout the hotel (including our room on the 5th floor). i was planning to stay 6 nights but checked out after one night because a strong cigar smell permeated the whole property, and had not diminished the following morning. | the staff were very friendly and helpful, and appeared genuinely surprised that i did not like the smoking smell - which suggested to me that it is normal in the hotel. | if you are not sensitive to smoking, or indeed wish to smoke, this hotel is beautifully fitted out (my suite was tiny, not really a suite at all, but absolutely superb in quality) and might be perfect for you. if you are like me - i cannot tolerate smoking - then i suggest you make enquiries as to how the hotel is dealing with this problem.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i took my mum for a surprise trip to the dorchester for afternoon tea as a special surprise treat for her after a difficult few months dealing with the death of her own mum. | we got the hotel having walked from hyde park corner and there was no doorman present, they were all be the far corner talking to some taxi drivers so we let ourselves in the hotel but we were not greeted to and i had to ask one of the staff members standing around the foyer where we should go. he suggested we might like to freshen up first and indicated the way to the toilets and cloakroom. when ready we went to the lady who was dealing with seating guests for afternoon tea who was very friendly and showed us straight to our seats. we were left for a bit with the tea menus before our waistcoat and tails bedecked waiter arrived to take our orders. | i am not a tea drinker and so ordered orange juice which was 100% fresh and delicious whilst my mum ordered decaf tea. he brought the drinks and the tea i could see was very pale and throughout the experience it did not seem to develop any better. the waiter poured the tea once and then my mum was left to top up herself for the rest of the afternoon. she only really drank a few cups out of duty as i was paying for the treat rather than because she was enjoying it. | the sandwiches were served and we had a choice of salmon, tuna, cucumber with cream cheese and chicken. my favourites were the tuna and the chicken sandwiches which were served in a greenish basil bread which did look unusual but tasted nice. we polished of two rounds (6 finger sandwiches each) and a chocolate cup with (lightly) coffee flavoured mousse before moving on to scones. | the scones are miniature rather than full size and there were plain ones and fruit ones served with pots of clotted cream, compote and strawberry jam which you can help yourself to. the scones were served warm and were very nice. we would have had seconds but three scones each had left us feeling a bit full! | next came the cakes, however i must say these were very disappointing. there was a tasteless yellow concoction which was apparently a lychee mousse atop a biscuit, a tasteless green macaroon, a small pear tart thing, a pastry case with fresh fruit and meringue and also a peanut butter mousse on top a biscuit base. we tried each of these cakes and none of them had much flavour at all and so we did not have seconds. | as we had booked for the second to last sitting we were pretty much able to stay as long as we wanted until we asked for the bill. the gentleman who brought it asked if we had enjoyed the tea so we said we had but that the cakes had been a disappointment. he promptly suggested that he could give us some alternative ones in our box to take away to try and see if we liked better for next time. when we opened our box later on at our hotel, the only cakes in there were the same tasteless ones we had not liked originally. | overall our experience at the dorchester did not fully live up to our expectations. we enjoyed the atmosphere and people watching, with the scones and sandwiches being delicious and the staff being eager to please but the actual tea itself and the cakes were very disappointing. i think the next time we try to go to afternoon tea we would try somewhere else to see if we can find find the whole package as, for us, the dorchester did not have it.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i have stayed several times at the rembrandt over the years and its a bit hit and miss with the rooms. this time it was a bit of both, the room was ok with the exception of the bed it was just too small and neither my wife or myself are large people. she slept fine but i felt like i was on the edge of a cliff and kept waking up. they also do not seem to be able to fix the heating its either on full or not at all, this time we had to have the air conditioning on in october. service was good but would help if the staff could try to smile. food was ok. i do like the bar/lounge area it does have a comfy feel to it. my tip is if you are staying ask for a room with a large queen the double beds or at least in my room were too small. the location is ideal with south kensington tube station only a five minute walk away and the v&amp;a museum across the road.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''the hotel staff are polite (guess they have to be). the room was nice but a quite small. we paid an extra 50 for a city view and was given a view of a courtyard and office block! not worth the extra and i felt a bit conned and mis sold! photos attached are of the view. | i would never stay here again!''',1
The Savoy,"'''i usually stay at the dorchester but decided to try the savoy this time around and am incredibly saddened to say i left feeling let down. | our party consisted of three ladies on a shopping trip and when we arrived by cab, had to get ourselves and our luggage out without any assistance of acknowledgement by the doorman - unlike the the dorchester who immediately make us feel like we are their most welcome guests when we stay there. | we entered the foyer and had to ask a lady to check in who took us through to another room where check in was ok. we then had to carry our own cases up a small flight of stairs before a porter came along to help. we got to the room where we had champagne waiting but only 2 glasses when we had booked 3 of us in the room. there were also only bath towels for 2. we requested an additional glass which took over half an hour to arrive but the additional bath towel never turned up. | no one informed us of the facilities at the hotel or where to eat so we had to find this out ourselves and only found the spa by accident when it was too late for us to use it. | we booked kaspar's for dinner and ordered still water but were served sparkling. upon picking up the napkins, they were incredibly damp and i had to ask for them to be replaced. the food was delicious though and i could not fault it. | at breakfast i asked for english breakfast tea and got served earl grey. although this was immediately rectified once i pointed out the error to the waitress, it is just not what i expected from the savoy after all the other little annoyances. | after a busy day shopping and with copious bags, when returning to hotel, once again we had to stumble out the taxi heavily laden with no help from the door staff. | finally, upon checking out, the bill was wrong and i was charged for breakfast which i had already paid for. again, this was sorted out but it puts a damper on the experience having to sit and produce documentation as proof of payment which should have already been in the system. | the whole experience just did not live up to expectations and i am incredibly sad to say that i will not be choosing this hotel when i return to london in the summer.'''",1

The Lanesborough,"'''booked a one night stay in a junior suite with dinner in the celeste restaurant. to put this review into perspective, my wife and i have stayed in many leading hotels around the world including the st geran in mauritius, the palace in gstaad, the jumeriah port soller in majorca, le manoir in oxford etc. so we are well versed in what makes a good hotel and restaurant. | let me start by saying that the location, the staff and the food at the lanesborough were superb and we would not hesitate to recommend it. | however, the room we stayed in suffered the following issues: the toilet was positioned so close to the wall it was almost unusable by a large man, the tv did not work as there was continual interference and the remote did not work whilst laying on the bed (you had to get up and move closer to the tv), the curtains are controlled by an i-pad and did not open following a 2 hour power-cut we had during our stay (no manual means of opening them so we sat in darkness), my wife had to ask for an extension lead as there were no sockets near to any mirror in order to use the hairdryer, the fixed overhead shower head was positioned in the centre of the shower meaning it was impossible to apply conditioner without being soaked (as a property developer we design and install luxury bathrooms so know how one should be laid out etc.) and there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. i do not want to keep calling for service when i want tea/coffee as i want to have the choice whether i call for service or make it myself. | now one might overlook these types of faults in a less well respected establishment but when paying 1250 for one night you feel you should not have to be mentioning them because they should not be there! it was as if no-one had dry-run the room before opening to paying guests. the hotel might argue that we should have called the butler who would have dealt with these issues but frankly there were numerous minor issues that would have meant the butler may have well as spent the whole time in the room with us. the icing on the cake was when we came to pay and there was an additional charge on the bill that should not have been there and no-one knew what it was. | in conclusion we would revisit the cocktail bar and celeste restaurant but would stay at another hotel with regards to the room.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i have stayed in a number of fairmont properties and truly expected this to be the best of the best, based on the price and reputation of ""the savoy"". what a huge and i mean huge dissappointment. i will never stay there again and on the 2nd day considered rebooking at another hotel. we planned our trip for one week at the hotel and upon arriving we asked for a room upgrade. we were told we could upgrade for an additional $160 per night. so we passed! we were not granted early check-in even though i am a president's club member of fairmont, so we had to go from an 8 hour flight to the hotel and then wait 6 hours for a room. the 2nd person that checked us in offered us a free room upgrade when we informed her of our anniversary! so, we went to the room and it was a 2 bedroom suite. it was fine, but nothing great at all, just seemed old. the bathroom had a tub/shower...and a rubber bathmat that slipped ever time you try to get in the tub. i fell 3 times getting into the tub. the bathroom is very, very old, not luxurious at all. the price for the room that we stayed in was approximately 450 pounds and if i had to pay that amount i would have been embarassed and mad because the room and hotel were just not resort-like or anywhere near a luxury hotel. i am still kicking myself for not checking out of the hotel and moving elsewhere. the restaurants there were ok, very empty and very pretentious waitstaff. one drink in the bar will cost you $25. also, the ""service charge"", vat and such add approximately $100 onto the cost of the already over priced room. be warned: stay elsewhere'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we have been a fan of mandarin oriental hotels for a few years now and are happy to pay a premium to stay in a fab room and receive their legendary service, as it is totally worth the extra cash. unfortunately this hotel was not up to the same standards as the others we have stayed in. | the room itself was tired - both in terms of the furniture and the decor. the curtains were pretty dirty, and the blinds did not fit to the window, so as soon as the sun came up we had light streaming in, so we were awake at 5am and could not get the blinds or curtains to close over it! | in the bathroom, the bath surface was peeling away leaving a grubby brown colour all over the bath. i called reception to let them know and see if we could move to a room with a cleaner bath. the guy on reception responded that lots of the baths are like this because they are so old and that we would not be able to move room. a supervisor was apparently sent to the room after a relatively abrupt phone call with the guy on the desk, but he/she never showed up! that is pretty poor for a mandarin! we complained again on check out and did get the service charge refunded, which was ok. just definitely something to look out for before you unpack, as it is not nice at all! | the rest of the hotel is also looking tired and in need of a refurb. we noticed the walls in the park restuarant had stains all up them and it felt pretty grubby and dated. the service in the restaurant in the evening and at breakfast was excellent though and we had some fab, delicious meals together. | considering the standard of the room and the patchy servivce we received, it was not good value for money. the hotel was expensive and i do not feel we had the same fab experience that we have consistently seen in other mandarin hotels. this is my first review on a mandarin that has not been perfect! very very disappointing. | next time we stay in london, we will stay elsewhere, probably for a cheaper price, and perhaps just eat in the restaurant here instead!'''",1

The Savoy,"'''there is no question at all the savoy is a superb example of opulance, good taste and you feel honoured to be able to enter such a fine example of the old fashioned london hotel, still operating in a style they do not apologise for. | it was a shame that some guests wandering around were unsuitably attired which rather showed there are two classes of clientele here. this most definitely is not the place for rucksacks and trainers..... | afternoon tea was pleasant enough but not the best experience and the bill was a pretty steep 120 for two - they had included the gratuity of 12.5% which was a bit surprising. i like to make my own decision as to what to pay as recognition of service. | the sandwiches were good, (5 small fingers each) and the scones (2 each) with jam and lemon curd were also delcicious. once we had eaten them, the stand was quickly taken away - no chance of being offered any more. the waitress came to offer small cakes on a tray and none of them was particularly appealing; she did not come back to offer them again, so we only had two tiny cakes. | for the finale, a rather cumbersome, ungainly, large wooden trolley was wheeled in and under the glass lid were three large cakes which were fruit cake and two other sandwich cakes to choose from. none looked tempting, so we declined. | there was plentiful tea on offer and the champagne was good but i have had far better afternoon tea elsewhere (the lanesborough is a favourite) and would not particularly recommend the savoy, or return. | the waiter who served us was very attentive and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job.'''",1

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''the location of this hotel is great, within a 3 minute walk to the nearest tube station (goodge st.) and close enough to walk from here on a nice day to oxford st. , covent garden and other central attractions. the staff is nice and helpful. | on the downside, some of the rooms are extremely small (a bed and a few inches to walk around it - forget about keeping your suitcase flat), room amenities are not provided (e.g. no soap or shampoo in the shower), and breakfast is basic (cereal, eggs and toast). overall the feeling is somewhat cheap. | the same block on gower street has a few other hotels. some of them seem to be much better than this one.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we often pop in here after a night in town en route to the train home. as always, the hotel was elegantly and beautifully decorated and presented and, as always, the service was impeccable. the quality of my drink, however, seemed to be of a lesser standard and i wonder if corners are being cut to improve profit margins. i always order hot chocolate: normally it is creamy and delicious but tonight it tasted watery and smelt a bit soapy. the mini marshmallows tasted very cheap and like plastic, and the chocolate shavings were like cooking chocolate. when you pay 7.50 for hot chocolate you want it to be a real treat.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''enjoyed beautiful views of the river thames from a deluxe room. the highest (most view) deluxe room is the 5th floor. the thames river view is also available from the balcony suites, which go higher. the deluxe room is a regular sized hotel room, with modernistic artfully designed furniture, so the whole effect, plus the river view is fantastic. the hotel room staff come in every time you are gone and make the bed, clean the bath. they also restock the drinks/snack items, that they overcharge for. the concierge was good too, they called the taxis, parked my car, and printed my emails. they do not have a business room, with its own printer. you need to coordinate with a staff member dedicated to the wi-fi downstairs. the whole effect is of a new modern hotel, but the lobby is small, cut down in size by the over large kitchen. restaurant: ate dinner there the first night; no more. ordered the beef plate which was huge, enough for 4 people, but it took 45 minutes and was charred so that i had to spit the charred pieces out, inedible. the accompanying side dishes tasted good, but the mushrooms had many bits of sand or grains or hard dirt. very unenjoyable restaurant experience overall. one good point, the restaurant overlooks the river walk where many people walk, jog and travel between their homes to work and back. using and being a part of the riverwalk was enjoyable. i was in london 5 years ago and walked this same area that was then only the drab, half occupied sea containers building. the mondrian has done well by developing this section of the river walk, with gas fired torches at their back entry to their hotel. also they installed a stair/walk down to the river beach, where one can walk, when the tide is low. a 100% improvement over what was there previously.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the service is great and as you would expect. they track through any special requests for example a birthday note to the spa, reception and restaurant and go that extra mile. lively and trendy atmosphere and a really funky modern hotel. it is let down by being just so expensive. a small coke costs 5, a small coffee 4:50 and the cocktails at 14+ are just so tiny. agreed that it is central london but for those prices the hotel does not give off much of a luxury feel as you would expect. very expensive but not necessarily very special. | i would recommend if you can get a deal. | we ate in the sea containers. food was decent but service quite slow.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''this is my fourth stay at the savoy. | i always found that everything was simply perfect, but this time something did not work. i noticed lack of organization and communication between the staff that really surprised me. | when we got there at 10 am obviously our room was not ready, but a nice lady at the reception desk told us that she was going to call us on our mobile to let us know when we could come back. no one called and at 4 pm we went back, the lady at the reception desk did not even remembered she had promised to call. it was upsetting because we were very tired after a long flight and we would have gladly used the room to rest had we known that it was ready. | the rest of the stay was wonderful, a big and spotless clean room, a good breakfast with great service. | then at departure something went wrong again. i paid the bill at 9 am but i asked to keep the key because we had another hour before taking the car to the airport. the lady i spoke with said there was no problem since the room was ours till 12 o clock. we left for a quick stroll and when we came back at about 9,20 the maid was preparing the room for the next guests, our suitcase were gone, and a guy was resetting the safe. i asked the maid what was going on and she said that the reception had told her the room was free. | we would have liked to have had the time to close the suitcases, check the room to see if we were forgetting anything, instead of someone else doing that for us and forcing us to wait in the hall for more than half an hour for the car. when i complained at the reception they said they had no idea why that happened. apparently the could not wait to get rid of us.'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''stayed here on business with my client. the rooms are ok but i found the dcor in general in serious need of modernisation. flowery wall paper is actually quite disgusting. the bathroom, however, was great. the shower was perfect with monsoon shower, the linen was as you would expect and the toiletries were high quality and in abundance. | what really put me off was when ironing a brand new white shirt, the iron provided was completely burnt out and ruined my shirt. when the 20 something year old house keeper came and started to lecture a seasoned soldier how to use an iron, it was somewhat annoying. | i would not stay here again if i could avoid it and although the staff are professional and helpful, the feel for me was a lot less than many other 5* hotels... | now, china tang on the other hand is a completely different story...!'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at the rembrandt for 3 nights in may 2014. we reserved a room here through amoma, which i would never used before. after making the reservation, i emailed the hotel directly to request a specific room. we asked for a quiet executive king room on a high floor facing the back. we stayed here for a week in 2012 in a room that faced the back, and the view was charming and it was quiet. the fee for upgrade was reasonable and i was very happy that our special request was to be honoured. | when we arrived the room was not ready. we were a little early, so we left our luggage with the concierge and tootled off for lunch. when we returned, the very helpful front desk staff checked us in and we went up to our room. | the room was small but well appointed. the linens on the bed were clean. the pillows were fluffy and smelled nice. the bathroom was clean and the toiletries were lovely. the water pressure was good. there were jacuzzi jets in the bathtub. the air conditioning was strong and responsive. | the breakfast is very good at the rembrandt. there is a fine selection. the breakfast room is sweltering hot, however, so if you are accustomed to somewhat cooler temperatures, e.g., you are not from a tropical country, do not get dressed up for breakfast because you will have to change into fresh clothes when you are done due to the sweat. that being said, it is a lovely room and the service is top notch. | here is the problem. we booked this room well in advance and i emphasized during our check in that we really wanted (needed) a quiet room because i am a light sleeper especially when i am training my body out of jet lag. the first night was lovely. during the second day, a couple moved into the next door room with two very loud children. the children were undisciplined screamers. it was obnoxious. | we called down to the front desk and complained, and the hotel offered to move us. i did not want to move, i wanted to stay in the room that we requested 2 months ago during the reservation process. the hotel should have a) moved the loud family, or b) not booked them into the room beside us in the first place. the two alternate rooms the hotel offered us both faced the inner courtyard, so we would lost our view. neither room had a jacuzzi bathtub. without the charm of the dickensian rooftop view from our original room, the lustre of the rembrandt faded quite quickly. it was also much, much noisier. | we chose the least noisy of the two rooms. we woke the next morning with headaches. when we left the room to get breakfast, we discovered that the walls in the hall had been painted. it reeked. | the next morning after that, we awoke to an awful racket in the hall. they were pulling up the carpets in the hall. | that was the final straw. there had not been any warning, no notice, no advice to the customers at all. it was utterly unacceptable. my partner and i were delighted to leave without a second thought. | the rembrandt is an expensive hotel in a fine, expensive neighbourhood. i expect better customer service from such an establishment. what a disappointment. we will not return.'''",1

Rhodes Hotel,"'''the rhodes hotel is among many within walking distance of paddington station. we selected it because of proximity and price and responsiveness to our questions. we found all the staff incredibly helpful and friendly, assisting us with typical tourist questions as well as several more complicated issues. our room in the annex was comfortable: good bed, small but renovated bath, and quiet and effective ac. sound communication among rooms can be a problem; the first night we were there all was quiet. the second night we were disturbed by people opening and closing doors to their rooms--nothing outrageous and nothing very late. breakfast, though not elaborate, was fine for our needs; good coffee, fruit, breads, and cereals. we would probably return, but certainly ask for a room on the lower floors and one whose entrance was apart from others.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i stayed at rhodes hotel in late march for a five-day trip to london. i chose to stay here because of the location and the price (75 for a single room in the main building, on the ground floor). | the best thing about it, for me, is the location. it is located a couple of minutes' walk away from paddington station, which has good connections to the touristy areas and heathrow airport. the street it is on is also relatively quiet and scenic. | i had paid 10 more than the normal 65/night for a single room (looking at the site now, though, it looks like the price has gone up) for a room in the main building, with a slightly bigger bed, a renovated bathroom and on the ground floor (travelling alone i was not sure i would be able to manage several flights of stairs with my luggage). i had (mistakenly) thought it meant i was getting the room in the picture. | looking back, i should have just said ""give me the room in your picture"". the room i got met all the requirements but had a window that opened to an air well and felt more cramped than i anticipated. | there are useful amenities in the room such as mini fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, tv (only a few channels, though), central heating, aircon, a small writing desk, attached bathroom with a shower and wc and free wifi (another highlight for me). | there is one computer that guests can use to go online. i used it only once to send my boarding pass to the printer at the reception area. the rest of the time i was happily able to go online on my own laptop in the comfort of my own room. | i would hesitate to recommend it to people who are a little pickier about cleanliness. on the day i arrived, i noticed a pill at the base of the small wardrobe (you would not notice it unless you bent down to see it). it was still there when i left five days later. i think the room gets vacuumed (i think they do vacuum the rooms otherwise there would have been more hair/dirt on the carpet by the end of my stay) but the corners are missed. | another issue i had with the place is the old-school lock on the room door. there is only one lock that secures the room from outsiders and anyone with the key (such as a housekeeping staff who might accidentally walk in on you while you are changing if you do not respond quickly enough when they come calling to clean the room) can enter. would have felt safer if there was an additional lock that only a person inside the room can open. | overall, i would recommend this hotel but would warn would-be visitors to mentally prepare themselves for the worst-case scenario, then the stay would not be unpleasant.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''have taken my time to submit a review on our 2 night stay at the hotel xenia in february earlier this year. | we made the reservation via lastminute.com secret hotels on a room only basis at a discounted rate. | yes it is good location, smart and offers all the facilities you would expect of a four star london hotel but the negative comments about some of their standard double rooms being exceptionally small are justified and accurate. | to be blunt even though our stay at the hotel xenia was at a discounted rate it is unlikely that we would stay there again in a standard double room even at a substantially discounted raten and absolutely not at their standard room rate charges. | of course i realise they offer larger more expensive rooms but frankly their standard double rooms are unacceptably small. | on a positive note yes the small rooms are clean, well appointed and the staff are friendly and helpful.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''what is sad about the savoy is that after the gbp 220m renovations completed on the property coupled with the world famous-ness of it all, we were left wondering how poor the conditions must have been pre-remodel. i am hardpressed to call this a five star property. this establishment is very sadly a very old and dated hotel with half assed renovations and trying to still live in its prime. we spent the majority of our trip at the corinthia, which was worlds away and beyond what savoy was offering. they are both supposedly of the same caliber, but savoy garnering the old world prestige, but the differences are immediately obvious. | to be fair, what i am mentioning are really just first world problems in the grand scheme of things. | -as a fairmont property, savoy charges 9.99 gbp/24 hours for wifi. not to be a brat about this, but when your only charge for a one night stay is the internet, most properties usually waive something as inconsequential as this upon checkout; but when you are running bankrupt as we read, i can see why you cannot offer it. corinthia? free. | -the concierge is just one person at a desk a time when we requested assistance on an impending reservation, they were assisting others and we were told they would contact us back, whereas at the corinthia, there was an army of staff behind the counter to assist us with anything we needed. | -the gym at the corinthia was 24 hours a detail that is very small and minute for anyone to notice, but when the availability is there for you to use a world class massive gym at anytime even when battling jetlag, you notice the difference. savoy? closed at 8pm. | -the guestroom is very old yes, they remodeled the bathroom with new amenities and marbled tiles, etc., but there is a janky little corner stand where they throw in some mouthwash and cute little le labo supplies. if you were really thinking through your remodel, you probably could have sprung for a little more effort in the shelving arena. the bedroom furniture is dated; yes, you could argue old world elegance, but i would say that its just plain old. the closets were old and musky, with newer amenitiesor just a safe. perhaps they skimped on the standard rooms when remodeling? but come on guys, go big or go home. | all in all, i hate being the one who writes a review to compare solely to another hotel, but maybe our mistake was staying at the corinthia first and then swapping to the savoy. if you are not into the whole historic elegance (very overrated) or into bragging that you stayed at this world-famous establishment, head to the corinthia its just down the street, worlds better, newer, fresher, and frankly less buildup for a complete letdown. | what i will say is that the service is great these people do try hard, but its sad when the amenities just are not up to par; you just turn into a sad used car salesman.'''",1
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''this is a fabulous hotel. fabulous in every way, except for the rooms. we were supposed to receive a room upgrade upon booking, and at check in, we were told that our room was upgraded to a suite with a park view. enter room, and it is hard for the two of us to walk around the minuscule room crowded with oversize furniture, not to mention with our two large suitcases. not a big deal, since we were only there for the night, but now that i am home and looking at the hotel website, i see that the room we were given is their standard, lowest level superior king room, not the suite we were told of at check in. but excited to see the view of hyde park, the park view actually overlooked the rooftops of the buildings across the street, and only if you craned your neck and pressed your face all the way up against the glass could you see a few trees. another funny/not so funny thing was that the hotel car that picked us up at gatwick drove us to the dorchester, not 45 park lane, so we walked over and awaited our luggage. super fun times after an 11 hour trip from scotland. we had hoped to eat at cut, but there was a dinner reception for an artist taking place that evening. instead, we ate in the bar, which was very chic and lovely. great food. room service breakfast in the morning was also quite good, but since the room is so tiny, there was not much space for the trolly.'''",1
Marble Arch Hotel,"'''i spent 2 nights there for an event happening at the hotel. people at the desk were very friendly and cosmopolite. however, to get to the reception, you had to climb a long stair as there was an escalator out of service for the entire stay and no one seems to repair it... . i had a very good executive room, pretty large and quiet, with a complete equipment, including a complete iron machine, which is very useful on a business trip. laundry service was excellent. buffet breakfast was ok but you had to queue a pretty long time, which is very embarrassing when you are on a business trip. overall, good service but ""old"" atmosphere, low ceilings and never ending corridors to get to your room. i rated ""average"" as i prefer more design hotel but i must admit that the executive room was very comfortable and large and service were very friendly.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i have been there few days 4 years ago. paid price was 50, the room was very small, a little noisy, but clean. shared bathroom. breakfast was ok. good location because near an ""underground"" station. i was satisfied, good service.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at the rembrandt as an incentive with flying with british airways. the bonus of this hotel is that its close to the natural history museum, victoria &amp; albert museum, science museum, harrods. | the local pub is hoop &amp; toy and shi shi frou frou member's only nightclub boujis. apparently the stars and the royals go there. the rejects go to hoop &amp; toy. lol | the hotel lobby and dining area is renovated and modern though does not reflect the rest of the hotel. the rooms were quite the disappointment.the corridors were dim and dated and the wallpaper was coming off in some areas. | our hotel room would have been spectacular if we were still living in the 70's. not sure how to explain - it had everything that a hotel should have including the high end amenities, however we could not get over the outdated decor. you could feel the spring in the bed and you could hear your neighbours flushing the toilet or walking above your head. the room had a safe as well as a trouser press! | overall our hotel experience was bizarre. i would expect more from this hotel as it is located in south kensington....'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we have been twice to the river restaurant since the savoy reopened last year. the location is great and the quality of the fittings stunning. our first trip to the restaurant was really good so we were keen to return. but this time the service was distinctly average, as was the food, and at 160 for two courses, we expected more. the service is obviously trying to be attentive - there are lots of smiling young people everywhere and when you give them simple questions (""where are the toliets?"") they are charm itself. give them something more difficult and they seem to run out of answers. and avoid any of the public areas on a saturday night - both bars had queues and even with a table booked in the restaurant, we had to wait 10 mins for our table. the jury's still out for me on this place.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we stayed in a deluxe king sized room apparently in an edwardian style however it was more art deco in style. the room was nice but not great and the decor was certainly not our cup of tea. my husband has had meetings here, at claridges, langhams, grosvenor etc but not stayed here previously. we have both stayed in nicer rooms for a third of the asking price! which have been cleaner too! ill get to this later. | the red lift was unique. a nice bit of history there and knowledge staff about the lift. the staff were friendly. however both my husband and i are not big on the pomp ceremony on arrival. maybe the americans are big on this and its what they enjoy and pay for. | checking in was smooth, shown to our room and the youngish lady showing us was expecting us to be bowled over by the room. we were most definitely not nor by the large en-suite bathroom. it was just large and in old victorian style fittings. | the room itself was not too large however the bathroom was enormous and i am not sure why its needs to be so large. who wants to spend most of their stay in there. | at night we found it was very warm in the bathroom and cold in the actual room. i dislike sleeping with bathroom door open. we had to leave the door open to warm the room. the grass cloth wallpaper had some stains and carpet looked a little tired. | there was no fresh milk ( or uht variety) in the room nor any biscuits. attention to detail was lacking. not everyone wishes to drink nepresso coffee using the pods. | house keeping need to dust the light fittings in the bathroom. they were dusty when i ran my finger over the chrome fitting. certainly not what you expect when paying such exorbitant prices for the rooms. the bathroom mirror was a little dirty where the mirror met the pewter coloured wooden frame. | breakfast was ok in kaspers restaurant. better quality bread needs to be offered for toast, not cheap tasteless poor quality pre-sliced bread. i bake my own wholemeal bread using quality ingredients and fresh yeast. if i can bake some why are you not able to source some. radissons have far better choice of bread! | the tea was nice as we had milk unlike in our hotel room. staff were glum / miserable in appearance in kaspers. more smiles would not go a miss. again attention to detail. two of us means we require two of butter knobs not one to share. the actual breakfast overall was average. i can cook a far superior one myself. | would we stay again, unlikely. there are far better hotels with far nicer rooms. rooms which have been cleaned to a higher standard. | we were underwhelmed with our stay as seasoned travellers, having stayed in many of londons finer establishments and around the world.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''good, clean hotel between knightsbridge and kennsington. location ok, rooms good (maybe a bit small for the money), very nice bathrooms. | lobby was very good, lots of quiet corners to work or have a small meeting. free wifi in the lobby area. | breakfast was good, but please improve the coffee. barely drinkable. | very nice and friendly staff. would go again if i had business in the area.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''booked for a special thank you for my wife. checking efficient and we got a room upgrade. rooms clean and well fitted out. had drinks in dandelyen, good choice and excellent service. all going well, then things started to go down hill. went to the rumpus room for pre dinner drinks, waste of time unless you want to wait for a waitress to finish a 20 minute chat with her friends on the next table or 3 members of staff rushing around another table because they ordered an expensive bottle of vodka. dinner got worse, ok it is a small plate/tapas offering, not a problem if it arrives in good time and is hot. neither was achieved on any of our order. ok they chopped the bill and gave us a couple of glasses of cheap house champagne, but still an epic fail. saving grace finished off the night back in the dandelyen with their great service and brilliant cocktails. perhaps the management of this bar should take over the restaurant and the rumpus room.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''i was in london on business and booked into this hotel by my client. it was very over priced. i was in a basic room overlooked by offices, which given its location cannot be helped but was not pleasant. | bed was very comfy, pillow excellent and bed room and bathroom very clean. | the staff were nothing exceptional especially the unwelcoming breakfast greeter..she ignored me mostly. maybe living in asia and having just visited dubai i am used to much higher standard of service. | location great during week for work. rubbish at weekends as everything around is closed. the hotel did not appear to have room service.. as there were no menu's in the room, but i stand to be corrected on that one. | there is no extra lock on the door, so you cannot double lock the door to stop any staff coming in or guests who may have been given the wrong card. | decor in corridors just looks cheap. for the price i would expected the whole experience to be a bit more special.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''well we booked about a month ago and went on the 17th feb, first sitting for my son's 18th (he loves afternoon tea, especially scones) - we arrived about five minutes early and waited a while to be seated. it began well and then tailed off from patisserise(3rd course onwards), for some reason we were waiting for tea. the scones were amazing, very light, not doughy, lemon curd not so good. the patisserise/pastries were tiny and well presented and made, good flavours, signature cakes, apple and cinnamon, flourless chocolate and fruit, glazed with fruit cakes. we asked for the champagne to be served towards the end. the cloakroom assistant was dozy and in the toilet facilities offered me a towel and left (no extras). i had been informed by someone who had been before the experience would be second to none. i do not feel that, neither does my husband -fortunately my son and his friend were quite enamoured. i paid and the the bill was another 30 including seervice charge of 25. i wish i could have visited all of the best tea venues in london because i am pretty sure i would have found something far superior to this!!! i will be taking this up with the hotel.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we had chosen this newly opened corinthia because of the raving reviews on tripadvisor as our favourite london hotel was fully booked. the corinthia appeared to be a wonderfully designed hotel with nice rooms and an amazing spa, but the service at the breakfast restaurant was a hit &amp; miss, the coffee not as expected and the staff from amazing to disengaged. perhaps one should wait until the dust has settled and try the hotel in a while again. the part which bothered us most was the location; it is very central in whitehall, yet far away from a huzzle and buzzle of covent garden and theatreland. we decided to walk one evening back to the hotel and the area faround the tube station felt unsafe.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,'''room was om top floor in another building near the hotel. room was small but complete and clean and warm. helpfull and friendly staff. underground station nearby. breakfast was good (we did not use the service of english breakfast for 6 pounds extra).''',1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this is hotel in a line of row houses across from the university college of london. it appeared all of the row houses along gower street are now hotels. this one had en-suite bathrooms available. my biggest complain was they provided the smallest bit of soap, made by the chinese. i did not expect a washcloth at this price, but i only managed 4 soap bubbles, and dropped it 40 times in the two nights we stayed. breakfast was filling, very standard, brought an extra serving of toast without kicking. coffee in sitting room is an instant type, but coffee for downstairs breakfast is no better, i believe i was told it is instant as well. there is a starbucks about two blocks away, but i learned to drink the good tea fast when i saw the prices. street side can get noisy from activities along the college way: bike rallys, marathons, party-goers etc. i would say ridgemont has great access to the tube to/from heathrow @ russell square. we used goodge sta and many buses for exploration. the main reason i picked ridgemont was it was close to british museum. it worked well for the 4 of us. wifi worked good for me both in room and lounge.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''booked for our 10th wedding anniversary, staff not very professional, presented with a happy birthday cake instead of anniversary cake. room good, breakfast average and did not get what was ordered. it is ticked off the bucket list and a big cost and certainly did not live up to expectations.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''the hotel is stylish but the infrastructure is old. it is in a convenient location with musical theaters, bars, trafalgar square and china town all within walking distances. i like the safe which has a small light whenever i opened the door. the food in the restaurants in hotel were of good quality. the check in and out was quick. the room i was staying was at a corner over looking a small ally. it is a bigger room but at night there were noise from the cars and works of the building next to the hotel. the water sink did not work properly. one of the electric sockets on the wall was broken and left a big hole on the wall. the bed was not particularly comfortable. there was no free internet. when i got off the taxi in front of the hotel entrance there was no one attending to my luggage. similarly when i was trying to get a taxi after checking out it was a bit of chaos at the hotel entrance as well. you pay for the style and location, not sleep and hotel quality.'''",1
City View Hotel,"'''only booked the one night as we were going to the o2, for a concert. | we arrived by train and after a 15 - 20 minute walk we found it. not sure what we were going to find as reviews have all been bad. the outside was a horrid green, but when we went in we were quickly seen and dealt with. we were given the family room and what a surprise, it was basic, but had everything we needed. seemed to be fairly clean. | the following morning after i would had a good sleep, we showered, all good except the curtain had seen better days. | what i will say is that the walls did have a few cracks that could be sorted very easy. | the breakfast we were not to sure about having read the reviews again. actually not bad at all. | all in all it was not to bad.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we stayed here for one night with the family just before christmas. booked a parkview suite. the rooms are very small, so are the balconies. they need a little bit of work, as they are mostly quite old school and dated. the views to the park are amazing. | the service in the hotel is very very good, in all aspects. they were struggling at the breakfast because it looked like they did not have enough staff. but that was an exception.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the hotel is easily found directly opposite the v&amp;a, reception areas are nice enough, although they have struggled with combining a more modern theme with the historic building. check in fine. unfortunately for this hotel our last stay at a four star would be very hard to beat...(see rudding park, harrogate). we were not asked if we needed help with our luggage and were given our room keys. entering the room i was very disappointed, i know rooms in london can be tiny, however as i had upped the budget for this one since my last visit (raddison bloomsbury) i was expecting a little more. the room was tiny, which i could have delat with if it was well decorated and had a bit of something to it...it did not it appeared tired and lacklustre. the bed was small and the bathroom tiny and a little dated. on this room i would not have rated this as a four star (and i accept that rating are not given solely on rooms). anyway we upgraded and were much happier. our new room was larger, in all ways and had a whirlpool bath. the tea-tray was disappointing with only english breakfast and instant coffee, nothing else. | breakfast was well cooked and nice, although the service very inattentive and we did sit for around 15 minutes beofre we had to catch a waiter to get coffee. | all in all, i think the hotel is relying on its location which although is good, i feel that given the excellent transport system in london you can stay in many places and have very good and easy access to the whole of the city. | i would stay here again, but only if the prices for the better rooms were much more competitive - but maybe we just booked a bad deal - who knows!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''spent a long weekend in london and used this hotel as a central base. its location is excellent within easy reach of theatres, west end shopping and royal parks. the staff were very pleasant and went out of their way to provide that extra level of service. however the room was exceptionally cold and the heating did not work. after several complaints we were given a room heater and finally moved to another room the following day. cannot fault the level of service but the accommodation was not up to its 4* billing.'''",1
The Savoy,'''unfortunately my family spent 3 nights at the savoy. this hotel is beyond over priced. the breakfast is terrible but they know how to charge. one breakfast was enough and all others were eaten at a nice dinner across the street. the next time we visit london we will not be staying at the savoy.''',1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my daughter and i stayed at the corinthia while attending wimbledon. the hotel is gorgeous, the location excellent and the staff tries hard to please. the problem is that the hotel is brand new and there are kinks to be worked out and training still to be done....and construction still happening. | i would recommend waiting a bit and trying it in a few months. it is going to be a winner.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''my family and i stayed here over new years eve, staying in two regular rooms and a river view suite between us. first impressions were fantastic, but for me the attention to detail is not quite there. | firstly the positives - the check in was hugely smooth; upon driving up to the entrance we were met immediately by a very friendly doorman and receptionist and show to our rooms - this despite it only being 12:30. you also could not fail to be impressed by the river view suite - the room is fantastic, kept immaculately with a stunning view. the suites also come with butler service which is incredible; our butler was so helpful you could not fault the level of service provided, in fact if you were to consider the room and the butler alone they would score a straight 5! | however even in the suite there just seems to be a few very small touches that are missing - there is a complementary beverage bar, yet the regular amenities were lacking - for example no cotton wool in the bathrooms and no slippers which just seemed a little unbecoming of any room in a five star hotel let alone a suite. the umbrella provided also broke within 5 minutes of use. our other rooms were ok; air con a little noisy in one and the drainage not brilliant in the other, although to be fair we did not mention this to the hotel as it did not particularly bother us. | the service also slips up in the rest of the hotel. we had made a reservation for the savoy grill and upon entering the restaurant were met by a lady with the most terrible attitude who informed us that our table was not yet ready (this despite it being the time of our reservation) and to come back in 10 minutes. when i suggested they could perhaps come and find us in the bar the lady repeated that we needed to return in 10 minutes - i have to say that the person who showed us to the bar following this exchange immediately offered to find us once our table was ready, but this initial experience dampened our views of the place. another poor experience arose when requesting our car to be fetched from the valet parking, which took 25 minutes. the staff did apologise once chased and explained that the delay was caused by road closures on side streets due to new years day; however having walked in the area around the hotel extensively immediately before getting the car we knew this to be incorrect. | we all left really wanting to love the hotel, but all agreed we would only recommend if in a suite. it really would not take a lot to pull this up to a 5 rating, the grading is purely due to the lack of attention to detail around the edges. | in summary, if you want a room with a view over the river you cannot beat the savoy - the check in staff, butlers and suites are fantastic. just do not expect perfection from anyone else!'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''easy check in. we were sent to the annex building, which is not based in the same hotel, its number 16 sussex gardens, yes, walking out in the cold, takes about 3 minutes to get there. our luggage was carried by a staff member, he was very gracious and polite. stairs were damn narrow to get there. | there is a house keeper at the annex building who was wonderful and really hands on for additional requirements, such as iron equipment. | i was disappointed with the size of the room, but it was so clean hence why they have blue lights in the toilet shower facilities to illuminate how clean it is. it certainly looked refurbished and i must say it was a well compacted, well designed room, everything was conveniently placed. excellent facilities, flat screen t.v, fridge. wifi but for two people still, we struggled to make way for each other. i was mostly impressed with the shower facilities, lovely big spacious shower, which was surprising considering the size of the room was so small. downside is, noisy people outside! those windows are not soundproof. also, heating was too hot that my sister could not sleep. | breakfast - looked even smaller than the picture! but, i was very satisfied with the variety. if you are a serious coffee drinker, you will be very disappointed with the coffee, but i did appreciate breakfast very much. but why such a small breakfast room? i was put off 2nd morning because people stood and waited whilst we ate away, awkward as they watched us. | the manager mr chris asked how we were on our first night, anyways, he was always alert to our needs. so lovely! i can see why people are raving about this hotel, the owners are so lovely, the most attentive i have come across from a hotel, but i barely saw them as we were sheltered away in the annex building. | location between lancaster gate and paddington tube, so convenient. also, kensington gardens were few steps away, which was lovely to walk through. really nice area. our stay was pleasant but i feel this hotel is a bit over-rated.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the two outstanding features of this hotel are definitely the location (just across the road from the v&amp;a/natural history museum and the science museum) with easy access to the underground (piccadilly line, which is also the line that serves heathrow), and the good breakfast which is served until 10am on weekdays and 10:30 on weekends. the neighborhood is safe so even returning to the hotel by the tube late in the evening is no problem. | the room we had was so-so. small, with very little room for large suitcases. the bed was comfortable. the bathroom was a decent size but no room around the sink area for toiletries, the shower temperature control was iffy, there was no bathroom fan and the window could only be opened a crack and would not stay open. trying to rid the bathroom of steam was not easy! the lighting was also poor (even though there were plenty of light fixtures) and trying to put on makeup in either the bathroom or the bedroom was exceedingly difficult. like all uk bathrooms there was no power outlet for the hairdryer, so that had to be performed in the bedroom. we also could not seem to achieve the right temperature in the bedroom as the heating system did not have a thermometer but cool/low/medium or off. there were also many strange plumbing noises throughout the night but i was unable to understand the sources! the room was serviced well and the housekeeping staff were pleasant and efficient.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''lovely hotel on the river right in the middle of all the south bank activites, but the hotel bars are a disaster ..... one fully booked up by the public and one more like a night club. we ended up sitting in the foyer.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the mondrian is a puzzle. service is top notch, and people are anxious to get into the sky bar rumpus room and even the ground floor dandelyan bar. | the rumpus room has great views and does have that party vibe, but the host station at the front is a bit daunting - it is a bit like st. peter looking in his big book to see if he is willing to let you in. everyone is very beautiful and stylized. | the dandelyan is much more approachable with the apex of ""bespoke"" cocktails (which are inventive and pricey). | there were restaurants and food that i did not try (actually i was there for a week and did not even know about what they call ""the den""). there is a cinema on site that i also did not visit. | so, onto the room. i had prepaid my booking, but upon arrival we were asked if we were interested in upgrading to a larger room with a view of the thames. we agreed to pay for the upgrade - and while yes, the extra space was welcome (as we would come from york, where our room was too small) - but i laughed when we walked in as the larger room came with no extra furniture to fill the space. | guests are effectively left with a doorless closet (a drape hides the contents) - it is about the size of storage you would find on a cruise ship, actually maybe less! there is absolutely no other furniture available to unpack. the close includes one rod and a small three drawer built in chest. but because the closet curtain opens to the right, the curtain gets in the way of the drawers when you are opening and closing them. | the well-sized bathroom includes shelves above the toilet (not exactly where i would like to unpack my clothes). there are two hooks behind the door for provided robes, but no other hooks or racks to hang towels. and those are some towels. the bath sheets are six feet long and i felt like a hobbit when toweling off. | glass-ware was plentiful, as well as a well-stocked mini-bar - though i doubt anyone is rushing to buy the special hotel candles with their trademarked ""lobby"" scent. | i have to call out mondrian for any ""green"" practices they may preach. every time housekeeping came for making up the room, or performing turn-down, all the lights in the room were turned on - as were every light in the bathroom. the room was set up with a room key slot that is supposed to turn off all lights when removed, but upon check-in, we discovered that someone had placed a folded paper card in there, where it remained all 8 days of our stay. seems like a huge waste of energy. | so, the mondrian, is super-stylized (the public areas are nice, i did not like the depressing blue used in the rooms, or the smeared paint ""art""). the staff is very courteous and helpful. the bathroom is nice. the views are great.the storage is hideous, but the bed is comfy. there is a surcharge for usable wi-fi.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we decided to spend a couple of nights in london as we often do with my two grown up children. | they say first impressions make all the difference so i was very unimpressed really from booking the rooms onwards | i booked on line with a well known web site - which was cheaper than the hotels own web site. yes, we had to pay up front with a cc but the booking was cancellable and refundable and still cheaper than their pay up front but not refundable rate and only made this booking a couple of weeks before our stay. | looking at the hotels own web site - with its 100% rate guarantee- i approached the hotel to match it. | on this occasion we are not able to match this rate offered by this online travel agent | then i sent them a copy of their own 100% best rate guarantee promise. .... | so, what does a 100% best rate guarantee mean? | the rate that you booked with - is a special members rate which requires full prepayment to obtain the discount | no, it was just hotels.com ! | the rates that we offer on our website are offered to public and do not require payment in advance. | on this occasion as a goodwill gesture we will be able to match the rate with no prepayment | | because we had paid upfront and their best rate guarantee did not apply. hummmmm ?????? | the reason i wanted to go direct is that they advertise priority room upgrade if you do book directly subject to availability) | so, i moved my booking direct with the hotel after they price matched. we had 2 rooms. on checking in - we were not offered an upgrade until i asked. they replied they were full which was not true because i had checked availability for that day already. we did get an upgrade on one of the rooms when i pointed this out - i should not have had to point this out ! yes, we had asked for an early check in but that should not have made any difference to the booking. it would have been nice to have been greeted with a lovely welcome and to be told our rooms were upgraded on checking in. | so, my experience with the corinthia was disappointing before we started our break. | we booked deluxe rooms. if you are taking family and want to book their standard rooms they do not have twin beds so you need the next level up. | the deluxe room was nice. not very large. the bathrooms were very lovely. identical in the deluxe and executive. rooms very clean with plenty of gorgeous soaps etc. but, the towels and dressing gowns were old and frayed. why would i want to pay over 500 /night for tatty towels. | the executive room was a nicer room. slightly bigger than the deluxe with the same walk in wardrobe which was a good size but the bed was hard and gave my husband a back ache. | breakfast - we had full breakfast package. | breakfast in the room was brought in exactly how you would expect in a 5* hotel on a trolley with a heated section. why then - when there are two people only give 4 little breakfast pastries not even one of the same each? yes, you have to tick if you want but at the savoy we always get presented with the most beautiful and generous basket of delicious breakfast pastries . | again corinthia. when my family went to the breakfast buffet - why would you even think of charging 2 for an extra something that should have been included in the buffet - are you so short of money? after all our 2 night stay including treatment each totalled almost 2,600 and that was with 150 taken off for a medical pedicure which nipped my toes and caused an infection. | the spa is beautiful but on a really warm day was far too hot and really unpleasant to sit by the small pool and enjoy - so i would say to use the spa during winter and not when the weather is lovely outside. | there actually is no outdoor space to sit if the weather is nice - no the lovely roof terrace you see on their web site is part of a suite! and probably that is the only way to get a great view over london from the hotel. certainly no view from our rooms. the deluxe room overlooked a courtyard .......this courtyard is an open smoking area but this gets no sun and no good if you do not smoke. so, you need to go over the road to a park if you want to get some sunshine. you are just a walk to anywhere.... and their doormen were lovely. | also, the odd 10 in the final bill that related to nothing. yes, you knocked them off the final bill. the spa too had an extra 175 but again this was removed when we pointed this out. | we live in london but often stay in town for a break. sorry corinthia, we will not be back. our last few london stays were at the savoy which is divine and the ham yard modern and gorgeous and both with fabulous service - were so much better in every way.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''was booked into the savoy because it was the only hotel with any vacancies at a sane room rate over wimbledon at the end of june. i normally stay at the langham but they were charging 800 pounds for a basic room. the savoys 380 all in was the lowest 5* i could find so found myself in this grand dame. i actually drive when i am in london and street parking was actually easy to find on the side street next to the hotel albeit quite pricey. was pleasantly surprised at the size of my room and particularly the bathroom after the cramped arrangements at the langham. room service food was also to a high standard. what i did not like was the fact there there was no mobile telephone reception once you entered the hotel. tried two networks and both did not work. not sure if the hotel utilizes jammers to increase communication revenues. i would hope not but its really strange that as soon as you step outside, reception returns. the hotel exudes a great amount of charm and if i did not require my hand phone and ipad on 3g then i would come back to the savoy but alas, i am joined to my mobile devices at the hip and unless the hotel is able to boost the telco signals in its rooms, it is back to the langham for me. pity.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''after trawling through so many websites looking for a decent bargain hotel in london we booked this straight away after reading all the positive reviews. | on price it was relatively cheap by london standards. we went for the superior double for 70 which got us a balcony (perhaps we got carried away it might be useful in summer but not in november!) and a modern bathroom with jacuzzi. the room was small with limited storage space, we had two large rucksacks which did not fit in the cupboard so had to stay on the floor in front of the balcony doors and got in the way. there was a fridge though which was a good touch. it was clean and in decent condition although the carpet did have a pattern that looked about 30 years out of date. the bathroom looked like it had been refurbished fairly recently and was fine, unlike the bedroom it was a decent enough size but the jacuzzi was fairly small not recommended for romantic couples! | the walls were very thin as well, one night we went to sleep to the sound of our neighbour conducting a long phone conversation while on our last morning we awoke shortly after 7am to the new neighbours chatting away for an hour. we may as well have been in the same room for all the noise protection the wall offered. | breakfast was basic but (mostly) fine, croissants, toast, choice of 3 cereals, fruit and yoghurt or an advertised english breakfast for 3 extra though we did hear someone else ask about this and were told it consisted of bacon, egg and beans which is only half of what you would expect from a proper english breakfast. the tea all three mornings was extremely weak once the milk was in it had no colour, the boy serving was very helpful and polite but his tea making skills are not up to standard! mind you a lady at another table said the tea was excellent so everyone is different. | the staff were all helpful in fact and one of the best features of the hotel. the other big positive is the location, a couple of minutes from paddington and from lancaster gate underground so the centre is in easy reach and also close to hyde park. a pleasant stroll across which gets you to knightsbridge, harrods, natural history museum and more. | we stayed in a hotel in the lake district a couple of weeks before for a cheaper price but with a much higher standard so we expected better especially as we had the superior double. its ok but reading all of the reviews i cannot understand the fuss i would not like to think that visitors from abroad think this is as good as it gets for budget accommodation as there is so much better than this elsewhere in the country.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this hotel is perfectly placed on the embankment at blackfriars bridge. the rooms are fairly small but adequate for an overnight stay. | service is less than you would expect from a hotel of this standard. | arrived back from world championship at 10.40pm to be told the kitchen; which shuts at 11, was ""closed,"" so room service was the option. | some staff are attentive, while others seem to be put out if you request service. | all in all not worth the money. better off trying the crown plaza opposite or the grange at st paul's, both of which will provide better service and value for money. | if you want be on the river then this is for you, but expect to wait for service.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''close to harrod's this hotel is much bigger than what it looks from outside. | it is a typical standard hotel in london. rooms are not particularly large but are clean. | bad is good. large selection of pillows. bathroom is quite small but acceptable. | bathrobe included (not usual in london for this category). breakfast has a good large selection. espesso and cappuccino are extra (!). wi-fi is included and quite fast. | service is good, staff gentle. price for london is good.'''",1
London Guest House,"'''nicely decorated rooms, with plenty of space. friendly staff and no problems during our over night stay. i would highly recommend for staying short period. not the best location but only half a mile away from nearest tube station. free wifi and trustworthy area.'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''the room was on the small side of average and the bed/bedding seemed a bit old. the tub was also rather slippery and tall. otherwise just a standard hotel with very very good breakfast which was included in our rate. the hotel is across the street from the victoria and albert museum and near several places to eat and a subway stop. we found it convenient and the staff were helpful.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''booked mondrian after visiting the cocktail bar on our last trip. when we arrived the check in was okay and we were shown to our room. room is okay. nothing to get overly excited about. bed is not the comfiest i have slept in and is quite narrow. we tried to get into the 12th floor rumpus room but was too busy and no tables (lots of non residents i guess) so left and went elsewhere. we managed to get in later that night and you are most definitely looked up and down to see if you pass their clientele. on returning to the room i phoned guest services to book a table for the next evening as we wanted to experience the bar with the terrace and views over bankside. sam the lobby manager spoke to me and assured me it was booked. when we visited that night guess what....no booking. not only does this hotel not have any priority for staying and paying guests but when you make a booking for you they lie. | he did come and see us that evening after i told them about how ridiculous that was. we got a table but it left a very sour taste in our mouths and we certainly did not feel like 5 star hotel guests. it is just run like a separate business. they do not seem to care. staff are not the most pleasant either and be warned there is an automatic 12.5% service charge even if you go to the bar yourself! | for the reasons of this bad experience we did not use the other bars nor restaurants in the hotel. | customer service wise we were not amazed. staff did not go out of their way for hotel guests which is surprising for the rating of the hotel plus it is american chain. | a candle wax covered pencil was left in the room to use....5 star standard?! not in any i have been in. | so if you want a hotel to pose in this is for you. if you want to get good service this certainly is not for you. we travel regularly and i review each and every hotel we stay in. from our experiences i do not think we would be returning here.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the location is fantastic and so vibrant. the hotel itself is ok. i would recommend that the management should stay in their hotel rooms to understand what is wrong: from wifi, tech, elevators, difficult lightning, not working sockets, closet ... | if you travel a lot there are probably better choices.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i still consider mo in chiang mai the best hotel i have visited so far, but this property is definitely not the best from the chain. | great location just across the road from harvey nicks on knightsbridge. comfortable for transportation no matter you choose to travel by taxi or subway. a guy in english suite opening the door as you come up to it. majestic lobby and hall. bar boulud is great for lunch. main restaurant by heston blumenthal serves better food of course, but a little overpriced (for comparable food to my mind) and you have to book a table loooong in advance. it is not so easy to get a table even for lunch even if you stay in hotel. rooms are good with marble bathroom and b&amp;o plasma. quite comfortable and nice, but better be sure you book knightsbridge view. in general good city hotel, comfortable and luxury enough for its price. definitely better than dorchester or ritz from my memories. | above are the reasons why i stayed there twice last year, but still i do not like this hotel. because of service. it is my personal experience. you never expect miracle from city hotels especially in a city like london, but in this case service quality is bellow average. nothing special although there is something. like on my first arrival i booked a hotel transfer from airport, but the car failed to arrive. my calls did not give any results. nobody knew why it was not there. was lucky enough to get a taxi at 11 p.m. or credit cards story. they book the amount twice first a deposit then a charge upon check-out even if you ask them to use the same amount. deposit keeps blocked for 30 days. when it happened second time i decided to complain to the hotel and somehow money returned to account the same day. it is possible then? it was like this in many countries before. but now i think this is the last place of a kind. and lack of service appears everywhere, sometimes in arrogance, sometimes in lack of lack of help | so probably i will return because of not so many options of comfortable stay in london, but without any joy:)'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''do not get me wrong - mo hyde park still is a fantastic property, top notch service and everything that you expect from a mandarin oriental is there. however, it sees that not only the hotel, but also the staff, are tired. | i have been a regular guest there for the last six years and my experiences were all good until last year, when i was there in my parents for my 40th birthday. spa and heston blumenthal reservations were wrong, lots of stress and an apology at check-out made me think twice before coming back, which i did this summer. | one might say that i am being too strict, but i was used to hotel staff calling me by my name, and also having service to be fast and efficient. this is not really happening. i was not at the spa or heston blumenthal this time, but bar boulud was ok - i mean, you do not expect this place to be ok, right? | rooms are still well kept and one must keep in mind that it is an old property that needs a lot of maintenance - but i believe it is time for a revamp and also some re-training on personnel to bring back the mo spirit. | bottom line is, for premium price we expect premium services and there are other five stars in town offering this better than mo.'''",1
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''great location and perfect service but at 500 plus a night for a room go stay for a similar location and a lot cheaper at the chesterfield. | amenities are usual with large shower and bath, and for an extra 20 the staff can fill the tub up for you....what a blast. | as is all modern rooms, everything is touch screen. call me old fashioned but i like switches. | the breakfast that is included in the hefty price is only the continental. at least wifi is included.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''despite accepting this is london and lowering my expectations, i still found the accommodation very basic. i stayed in a single room on the top floor and it felt like i was in a cupboard! there was no room to lay down my suitcase and it was quite claustrophobic. however, there were certainly some positives. the man on reception was excellent and kindly carried my bag up the four flights of stairs. the breakfast was adequate (you have to pay extra for the full cooked breakfast) and i was impressed with the friendliness of the staff in the small dining room. the wifi reception in my room was perfect. the hotel is certainly in a convenient location when arriving from overseas via the heathrow express to paddington and a perfect base for exploring london.'''",1
London Guest House,"'''we found the london guest house to be good value for money. london hotels/b&amp;bs (the guest house is advertised as both depending on where you look) are generally expensive and we found the guest house to be one of the cheaper ones that still offered acceptable quality. | the hotel is in acton, which is a little bit out of the way of the city center, but we nevertheless felt safe outside at night. there is a bus stop right next to the hotel for bus 266, which runs every 6-8 min on weekdays and will take you to north acton tube station on the central line (walking there takes about 20-25 min). from there it is easy to get to the main sights in the city center. obviously this location is not perfect, but considering the prices you pay for a stay in a more central area its really quite acceptable. get an oyster card from the shop across the road from the hotel to pay for public transportation. | we arrived late at night (about a quarter to one) which was no problem because the reception desk is manned 24 hours a day (we did specify our arrival time during booking to make sure we would not be considered a no-show). our room was barely large enough for a bed and a small excuse for a desk (it could just about fit our laptop), but it came complete with a small coffee/tea making facility, a large locker (big enough for the laptop), a flat-screen television and a slightly foul-smelling fridge. do not expect much space to store your luggage, but for short trips this is hardly an issue. the bathroom looked very new and clean and had a nice strong shower, but was amazingly small. especially the toilet area could have done with a few extra inches of space: i am quite tall and actually had to sit slightly sideways on the toilet to accommodate my legs. | service was generally good, with staff at the reception desk always available for advice (which is especially welcome since there was no hotel information in the room). there is wireless internet which is supposedly available for a fee, but we got it for free. reception desk was also helpful when we were kept up at night by someone in a neighboring room having the television on quite loudly: they went up and asked them to turn it down a bit, which had an immediate effect and allowed us to get back to sleep. however, it also shows that the hotel is not very soundproof. additionally, there is a main road outside and a parking lot at the back, which every now and then featured talking people in the early morning, so do expect some city noise. we also experienced a few interesting quirks that come with a small family-run hotel: on one day the clean towels were late due to a problem with their cleaning service, and on another day our dirty coffee cups were replaced with brand new ones that still had the price tags on. | breakfast was very limited and just about acceptable. a large television was loudly showing bbc news. the selection of food was minimal, even for a free continental breakfast in a budget hotel. all products looked cheap as well. still, it was enough to get us started in the morning. | to summarize: book this hotel for its value compared to quality. we recommend it for a short stay: its clean, there is a free breakfast included (albeit a minimal one), the staff is nice and the location is ok. we do not recommend it for a longer stay because the small room and bathroom and the limited selection at breakfast would all become annoying after a while.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this is a modern hotel and nice and clean, quite distinctive with the copper sweep of a wall around reception to resemble a ship. | located close to blackfriars bridge it was quite well located for what i wanted. | room was quite spacious and well fitted out with free wifi. | if i was to be super picky i found the menu on the tv to be cumbersome and it was annoying but in a mild sort of way. | breakfast was plentiful with a very good choice. the scrambled eggs were better than most and the coffee (when i eventually got some) was probably the best i can recall in flavour. on the first morning i did not get any coffee but did not have time to bother pressing the issue. for this reason and only this reason the service is marked down. | the bar was good with excellent service, making cocktails with the specific type of rum i requested, so good i probably had one more than my standard despite the fact that it was not cheap. | overall the hotel is quite decent and fairly priced.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i stayed at the dorchester in 1997. it was a tremendous experience of first class service in a london landmark. i revisited there in november 2010 to dine in the promenade. this was a disappointment. the waiter forgot our order, then served it cold, without interest. the entertainment was an off-key singer. the building is the same, the decor is the same, but the original spirit of british warmth and excellence is gone. we were saddened by it all and left. we will not return.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''having stayed at the rembrandt for two nights, i would say it is very convenient if you are visiting london and doing some tourist stuff. the hotel is just a few minutes walking distance from south kensington tube station. v&amp;a and natural history museums are just across the road. (shame we missed the david bowie exhibit at v&amp;a as the tickets are all sold out). | we booked two rooms, and we arrived hotel at 3pm in the afternoon. for some unknown reason, the receptionist changed our room numbers from the 5th floor to the 2nd. she mentioned that they are fully booked, but they still managed to have our two rooms on the same floor. but i am just a little puzzled by their booking system and priority. | the air-cons in the rooms really vary. it was in the middle of the summer, and we were possibly having the hottest day of the year. my parents' room just always luke-warm and the air-con does not seem to have any effect. luckily my parents prefer warmth to coldness. on the other hand, my husband and my room is freezing. not until a couple of days later, we realised we both were having a fever. | the breakfast is a little bit chaotic, as they only have one guy at the desk, and you usually need to wait a bit until he get around to attend you. but they are polite enough. the food is fair. | the wifi speed is fair and available in all rooms.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i decided to drop by espa at the corinthia hotel during a quick business visit to the uk. having won the top spot in a uk spa ranking, i thought i would be in for a special treat. | the treatments themselves were truly top notch, but what almost destroyed the experience for me was that someone in a neighboring pod kept banging cupboards all through my massage. even though i told my therapist to try and tell them to keep it down a bit, it took them about 15 minutes till they were back to that ugly habit! | the whole point of a spa is for you to relax and unwind and, when it comes to that, other places do it better.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i am probably not the target demographic for this painfully trendy hotel but for anyone who likes a.) a bit of comfort and b.) things to just work without being too complicated, my observations are: | the rooms are okay - very 'designed' but strip away the infuriating lighting and the uncomfortable desk chair and you have a very basic room. comfortable enough but not luxurious. | check-in area is very beautiful but there were too few staff both for check in and out when i was there. they did not pay attention to what was included in my room rate so there was an unnecessary 'exchange' about the wi-fi, and whether i was entitled to the super-fast. | overall a bit of an annoying 'so what?' for me.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''fabulous location, just across from the v&amp;a, a 5 minute walk to south kensington tube and 10-15 minute walk to harrods. reasonable rate for the location. that being said, there was little to distinguish this hotel. fine but not special. service was mediocre. breakfast buffet was okay. i asked for a quiet room and was given a room in the farthest corner of the hotel that looked very much like an afterthought to planning. bed and pillows were terribly uncomfortable. there is a business-computer in the lobby but no printer. there never seemed to be staff available to answer questions, save for the front desk staff who were always busy. i asked for an umbrella one day when it was raining, and it took over 10 minutes for the staff to log my borrowed umbrella into a log with my name and room number. small things like this leave a terrible impression. nothing terribly objectionable here, but i far prefer other hotels in the area. stay for the location but look elsewhere for ambiance and service.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we went to the savoy to enjoy afternoon tea in the thames foyer and were left disappointed. we arrived and had to wait to be seated for a minute or so, to be expected and nothing wrong with that. had a great table, thames foyer looks stunning and atmosphere is brilliant. however, after we sat down and the service begun, it went downhill from there. we go for afternoon tea at a different hotel every couple of weeks just to try out different things and this was the first time we heard the phrase no, we cannot do that. we always order one afternoon tea to share between us as we find it to be a lot of food; this has never been a problem, until the savoy. we really found it difficult to comprehend that this would pose such a problem. we spoke to another colleague, who was a little more helpful and said that in normal practise they do not do that but he would do it for us. then we received two of everything anyway. we just wanted one of everything to share, cannot be that difficult surely. it has to be said that after the whole thing we did half understand what they meant with this and we offered to pay for both but it was sort of forced as they were serving us as if we ordered two. on top of this we found the staff to lack a bit of communication and consistency. we were served tea, and then our cups refilled, great, but as an example one server filled our cups, and then literally less than one minute a different server came and filled (what they could) again. then at one point we had empty cups for at least 5 minutes. it has to be said that the food was great, as expected. unlike other hotels, they do not clear as you eat, we had dirty plates left on the stand for a long time. also the sugar bowl was so far in the corner that i could not reach it, as my partner was elsewhere she could not get it for me. found the staff not too smiley either, its amazing how much smiling staff makes a difference. even if they do not want to be at work, let us face it, who does, but at least they could pretend properly. male toilets very disproportionate, 14 or so urinals and 2 claustrophobic cubicles (sorry to talk about it but it is a bit dense). we then received the check without even asking, with no pen. we decided to go to the bar to try that out, transferred the check there and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. host at the bar was very friendly, and so were the rest of the staff in the bar to be fair, but just very slow. it must have taken at least 20 minutes to get our drinks. the people on the table next to us arrived 10 minutes later and received their drinks sooner that we did. cocktails were brilliant though. bar snacks were the worst we have experienced, felt stale and were boring. so we left liking the savoy product, but found ourselves not craving to return because of the staff. this is all based on afternoon tea and the beaufort bar, this is not to say that if we stayed there it would be the same. the problem is we do not really want to find out anymore. one word review: disappointing!'''",1
The Savoy,"'''some hotels use luxury to make you feel at home and comfortable. this one uses it to maintain some sort of social exclusivity. my wife noticed that the staff operates in an extremely regimented and class-conscious fashion. ask the wrong person to help you with something, and you are likely to get a sneer for failing to observe the proper pecking order. perhaps that is a reflection of the british class snobbery, but we found it very unappealing. | the location of the hotel is quite nice, but downtown london is easily accessible by taxi or underground anyway so it is not clear that the location is worth paying for. my wife was quite impressed by the 8"" mound of pigeon excrement outside the window. we stayed in another hotel for three nights in covent garden for half the price, and were as comfortable as the savoy. everything will cost you an arm and a leg at the savoy. at the end of your stay you will be able to say you stayed there, but you will probably wonder why you spent so much and what the big deal is.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''mandarin oriental is one of my favorite hotel companies in the world. so i cannot say i would not recommend this hotel because as usual, the staff was very professional - albeit short of the level of mo excellence. now granted it was holiday but the staff felt forced and well, tired. and i guess that is how i would describe the property in general. do not get me wrong, the location is great. the property is indeed considered five star rated. it just needs updates that a hotel of this level requires; the carpeting was dirty and coming apart, the showers are dated, etc. again, lovely, just missing those small details that are derivative of an mo property. and i think for the price, in this neighborhood, i prefer the hotel baglioni nearby. i recently had friends stay there in july of 2014 and they felt the same way...not bad at all (really, who can complain), just not mo level that is all. perhaps i have just been so spoiled by the others!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this is mainly a review of the restaurant. we stayed at this place and it was an ok hotel. kind of equivalent to an upper middle us style hotel in any big city in the us. staff were polite and the main issue was that their wifi kept cutting out. nobody seemed to know why. | this is mainly a review of the restaurant. we stayed at this place and it was an ok hotel. kind of equivalent to an upper middle us style hotel in any big city in the us. | the restaurant is generally empty at nights and that is because the place is a disaster. | the place smells rancid. as if it needs a good cleaning. we wanted something simple one evening as we were tired. my wife's spaghetti bolognese sauce was awful. i can make better myself. the chef did nothing to make it ""restaurant quality"" as the ""masterchef"" judges like to say. my fish and chips were nearly inedible. the chips were oily slugs at the bottom of my plate. the fish was mostly soggy batter. | one thing really annoyed me and that was they added 8% vat to the bill, and not to the prices on the menu. i never saw another place do that. value added tax is supposed to added in the price of a material. they were being tricky here. they also added a service charge so make sure you do not double pay a tip so we ended up paying over $60 with a 20% tip and tax surcharge. | this is a very bad restaurant attached to what should be a major hotel in the heart of london. shame. it ruined their rating for me.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''my wife and i spent a few nights in one of the prestige suites at the savoy as we have got some very special occasion. the hotel is by no means very luxury and you are always expecting a decent customer service in there but we were disappointed slightly... | here are some negative things i wanted to flag up: | 1. small bed: i mean, you are charging 1600 a night for a one bed suite and providing just a double bed? one of us had to spend a night on a sofa in the living room - not ideal. | 2. old iphone dock: we were planning to use an iphone dock but it was with the old 30-pin connector. when we asked if they have any adapter for a new iphone - they offered to buy one for 40... 40? it costs 25 in apple store, by the way! | 3. late check out: we have asked to have a late check out as i have got a meeting in the morning but they sent us a very late notice at 6pm on the day before checking out that it will not be possible and we had to move out at 12pm so i cancelled the meeting. | 4. breakfast: the breakfast itself was great - there are a few options to choose from: english, continental, chinese and japanese. we have got a free breakfast and asked if we can get a chinese or japanese one (they cost a bit more than the english and continental ones though) - a lovely lady at the thames foyer advised that it is not possible. on the next day we realised that it was actually possible to get anything on the menu... so can you please make sure your staff is well informed. | thank you!'''",1

"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''...that let my relationship with the wellesley down. | it is a well-appointed property. the decor, quality of furnishings is fantastic. the service delivered by the concierges, the door person and the driver of the hotel's royce (who well deserve to be remembered by their names - shame on me - such memorable and impressive service) are absolutely six star, truly outstanding and absolutely perfect. and, i love staying in good quality new(ish) properties - they have that wonderful freshness about them... | so, why not ""excellent""? well, my expectations were high. we booked a junior-suite with a park view. yes, there is a park, and you can see it perhaps from the hotel's higher floors, not the suite to which we got upgraded (for a fee of course), which overlooked a busy street, with the park trees being just a tree sigh rather than a proper view. | on the last morning, room service breakfast came with seriously off-salmon eggs benedict, which resulted in a prompt visit from the kitchen and sincere apologies, and taking the eggs of the bill. as could be expected. right. going beyond the expected would have had the whole breakfast (that is a few pastries and juice) come off the bill. that is what i would do if i wanted my business to be reputed for excellence in service, rather than for its fairness... | there were also a couple of little, perhaps insignificant details that escaped room attendants' attention - a tear in a bathrobe, out of order light console in the bedroom, to mention a couple. | and, a month later i have not received my copy of the invoice - it was to be e-mailed to me... yes, i could have followed it up again, but should i really have to? | so, go in with no expectations, and if you want a view, ask for a high-up room. you will be pleased with your choice. if you expect excellence, well... experience is relative to expectations...'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i did not stay over at the corinthia but went to the bar off the back of several recommendations. unfortunately, i was less than impressed with the service. i frequent a lot of london hotel cocktail bars as i like the ambience but this was not what i was expecting, considering the corinthia has a 5 star rating. | the bar is beautiful and has an amazing piano come bar thing and lovely decor but the lack of attention from the staff was disappointing considering we were paying 14 a cocktail or thereabouts. it took about 20 minutes for the waitress to come over and take our order- they looked rather rushed off their feet despite the bar not actually being heaving- and then she had to come back to ask again as she would forgotten what we wanted. nobody came to check everything was ok once our drinks finally arrived, they did not clear the table when we had finished our first round until i signalled politely for them to come over. to add to that, the cocktails were not actually that great! | do not think i will be returning. check out the langham for drinks instead.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''two nights in this hotel. the rooms are perfect. especially for london, the rooms are spacious and the interior is new, clean and well finished. | too bad that i had to notice there was no warm water the second night of my stay when i returned between 2300 and 2400 hour in the hotel. my decision to postpone my shower until the next morning was not wise: no water at all the next morning! | of course a problem can occur, but a hotel like this and in this price range should be able to fix problems overnight. and if it is not possible to fix this, the first thing the receptionist should tell you next morning is: my sincere apologies, of course we do not charge the second night. | in the end i had to ask what was wrong and i had to ask for at least a discount. after we had left we received a 25% refund. | if i had a good hotel like this, with all taken care of, i would have chosen a one night refund for all the guests in stead of only a small refund with the change of the customers not returning again.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed for 2 nights in the rembrandt as most of the time when in london we stay there because of comfortable rooms and good breakfast. this time, although we stayed in a grand room which is supposed to be the best they have, we wee quite disappointed with what we were given. the room is tired and in need of refurbishment, the mattress was not comfortable and the feather pillows we used to find in the rooms have disappeared! i did ring housekeeping to ask for feather pillows and got some but i am sorry to say they were the bottom of the range. | however, housekeeping staff were very friendly and good, reception staff were a bit offish...unlike what we are used to when staying there in the past...and prices are going up and up...is it worth paying this money for what we got??? we could stay in other 4 stars hotels in london for the same price and get a better room...shame about it, i was very fond of this hotel.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''my partner and i booked an overnight stay for our first year anniversary and were given a room on the top floor in the corner. the staff who we checked in with were pleasant and helpful escorting us to our room. we visited the gym area during our stay, which was very pleasant and relaxing and had some of the higher class aspects you would expect.however, we were surprised to find that wifi was at an extra cost bearing in mind the price it cost to stay overnight and the fact this is even provided in budget hotel chains. furthermore, there were no tea and coffee or biscuits in the room. the bed was lovely and comfortable but it later materialised that we were woken up constantly throughout the night and could not get back to sleep after 5am due to the constant noise from the plumbing and water going down the pipes around our room, which was absolutely horrendous. the breakfast we had was absolutely lovely, however after the night's 'sleep' or lack of this did mean that we did not enjoy it as much as we would have wanted to. this was a massive shame; we had really been looking forward to our stay in particular as it was such a special occasion for us and were left disappointed.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''my husband and i used to stay at this hotel every time we visited london...but not any more. i mean, the hotel remains an excellent location and good room but services has just come down. a lady named sofia was the least helpful person in the world. i made a mistake doing the reservation, asking for two twin beds when we were four in the room. i asked her if she could change that, even if i had to pay more for a larger room or bed. but no, she had to stick to the reservation and there was no way anything could be changed. later on i asked her how to place a call internationally (i was asking for the international code) and she answered that it was going to cost me a lot and that it was not convenient.....i do not think it was her place to say that...'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed for a night at the mondrion and were impressed by the design and finish of this hotel which is right up there with big brand names such as mandarin oriental etc. the location is fabulous and we enjoyed a wonderful vista of the thames and panoramic views of the city and st pauls while having breakfast al fresco in the downstairs restaurant. ten out of ten for finish and location. however, the service at the mondrion in terms of waiting staff was awful. the breakfast was poor in quality and taste and therefore completely overpriced for what it was. very disappotinting given the style and finish of the surroundings in addition, the waitor refused to write down our orders and then got them wrong. instead of apologising he argued and stated that no errors had been made.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''we stayed for 4 nights as a triple occassion for us as a couple. we previously enjoyed a visit 4 years ago and vowed to return to celebrate our special occassions having had such good service previously. | overall, the service and food were very unpredictable. the hotel is lovely but spells of poor service, food and lack of respet for guests tainted our second visit. | breakfast in the grill came out as a wrong order twice, and when i did get mine eventually, the food was cold. | the staff were kind enough but were unable to understand orders much of the time and we did not want to make any fuss and humiliate what was already a rather diffiult situation so i ate cold eggs and bacon from a cold plate with cold toast. | evening meal in the grill was more successful but subsequent food in the promenade in the evenings again came out cold; had run out; was a long time coming. we entertained friends on 2 of our 4 nights and felt a little embaressed. our main complaint though is that guests appear to have to take a back seat to customers who have booked afternoon tea and hang around untl late. on several occassions, we wanted to just sit and have a pot of tea in the promenade to be told it was full, the bar was full and as there is no tea making facilities in the room, we had no further options but to sit and wait. bearing in mind that there is also a minimum room service order of 25, ordering pot of tea for 2 would amount to 12.50 each. | positively, some of the male waiting staff in the promenade were lovely and very friendly; the check in desk staff were also very sweet and kind. rooms are of a good standard (one would expect this of course). | given the high price tag and amount of 5 star hotels in the area of mayfair, we would likely look elsewhere when we come to london again. as a guest, i do expect to be able to sit quietly and have a drink in hotel lounge/bar and read a book or paper after a long day out-particularly if this is not provided in the rooms. it is a shame.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''initial enquiries | my inquiries made prior to and after the booking received fairly prompt response although one took 4 days from the date my email was sent out. | service | the service was very warm. both the proprietors and staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. | cleanliness | overall cleanliness is good although i did find the lobby old and shabby. the reception counter was rather cluttered. | room | i have claustrophobia issues and found the single room i booked to be too small for comfort especially the en suite. the shower stall is so narrow that there is hardly even room to turn around. i found the water pressure to be weak. taking a shower was a feat in itself. the worst thing about the room was the sink. it is fitted into a corner and is to tiny that i could cover it with the palm of one hand. to compound the problem, a disproportionately large shelf is fitted right above it so there was no way to bend over the sink fully. i did not want to swamp the bathroom so i had to wash my face in the shower and barely managed to brush my teeth at the sink. the towels provided were small (just enough to wrap around my sz8 frame) and seemed grimy. i used them nonetheless as i did not bring my own towels. | i understand that space is a premium in london and i think the room could be comfortable enough simply by putting more thought into the furnishings. it appeared that the fittings were meant for a larger room but squeezed into a single one. how much storage space can one person need right? a mirror against the wall above the table/desk replacing the large shelf would make the room appear more spacious. ditto the shelf above the sink. | there is full coffee and tea making facilities in the room and one thing i liked about the room was that it had it is own air-conditioning unit so i was able to control the temperature. | facilities | they provide a continental breakfast free of charge. not a large selection but i am not particular about food as long as it fills me so i was fine with what was offered. those with more voracious appetites or want a bit of variety can opt for a cooked english breakfast for 3. | there is a computer with internet facilities outside the breakfast room which you can use free of charge. of course, do be mindful that other guests may wish to use it to. i generally try to keep within a 10-15 minutes limit. | maps and attraction brochures are available at the reception area. | there are no lifts. my room was on the third floor and there were many flights of stairs to climb. it is not a problem for me but might be for those with mobility issues. | surroundings | the location is the best thing about the hotel. it is about 2 minutes walk from paddington station and less than 10 minutes to hyde park. there is a bus stop just slightly further down the road. | value for money | the price is reasonable by london's standards. | i wish i could say i liked the hotel and found it comfortable but i did not. fortunately, i am out for the most part of the day and needed a place to crash at night so it served its purpose.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''i gave this an average rating not because the hotel or its staff were average but because compared to the cost and its location i felt that is was not great value for money. | i appreciate that if you are a business user coming in to waterloo the hotel is in an excellent spot but on this occasion i was a tourist and with the hotel been south of the river it just makes everything a little more difficult to get too. | the fit out of the hotel is to a very high standard and some of the design features are fantastic in the public areas. however the rooms just seemed a little plain and average. | the staff were very polite and willing to have a conversation but i think due to the hotel been a little new they did not really know the important stuff. like the best place to grab a cab and whilst they did try they did not seem to have the tricks that other doormen have to grab you a cab when your in a rush. | i personally would not stay here again as i felt for the money i paid there are other hotels in the west end where i would prefer to spend that money.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''fantastic location of this hotel, very convenient. the room was lovely and the facilities in the room were good. the concierge service was excellent and was the stand out in this hotel. there were a few issues however. the hotel did feel like an airport hotel. the reception staff were cold and bordering rude. they did the the absolute minimum. the most unfortunate thing however was the lack of communication between the bars the restaurants and the hotel. from the moment we booked the hotel, we had numerous conflicting emails from the hotel staff, both the bars and the restaurant. it was not an easy booking process. | another issue is that this hotel did not give any sort of priority to the hotel guests at either of the bars, rumpus or dandelyan. | i would only stay here for the location but for nothing more. | room service menu was also not great and very overpriced'''",1
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''having stayed at other dorchester collection hotels we had high hopes of 45 park lane. | check in was very efficient and we were quickly taken to our room, it had great views of the park. however a few areas for concern... | the room looked a little tired, a few marks on the sofa, a rip on the leather by the door ... not quite what we expect from dorchester hotels. | the mini bar also had some half drunk water, which was very disappointing. the bath tap was broken.... all minor points but not what we expect from 5* hotels. | we usually stay at four seasons and despite the hotel bar and restaurant being absolutely superb i think i would not return to this hotel.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we chose this hotel after reading about the fantastic riverside views and proximity to the tate gallery, festival hall and globe. we were not disappointed. the view of saint paul's and the river is, indeed fantastic and we ended up leaving the curtains open night and day. bankside and waterloo tube stations are both about a 10 minute walk. the matresses were very good, the room clean and the bathroom with walk-in shower was excellent. | the downsides? for my tastes, a combination of a preoccupation with alcohol and ""bling-bling."" the roof top bar/bistro was closed to anyone under 21 and the ground floor bar was closed to under 18's. as we were with a teenager, this ruled out any glass of white wine at the end of the day. in addition, the top of the minibar in the room was covered with bottles of booze of all sorts (the fridge was full too!) although our teenager thought it was cool, personally, i thought it was overdone and tasteless. there also seems to be a preoccupation with furnishing piped music everywhere (lots of reggae) which i found irritating. we did not try the restaurant as it always sounded loud. fortunately, the rooms were very quiet. | the hotel decor is very modern, even impressive if you like this style. the staff were friendly and always helpful, especially the porters who seemed to be a cool, young bunch and very helpful and watchful of all that is going on. | there are number of cafs and coffee shops around the nearby tube stations if you only want a light breakfast.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i recently spent five nights at the xenia, and there were many positives about my stay. however, the negatives included a bed that was hard as a rock after a long day of much walking, a persistent noise outside my window, and room temperature which was out of the control of the guest. all three of these negatives made for 4 out of 5 sleepless nights. the positives included the location, the helpfulness of the staff, and the room's lovely natural light. would i stay here again? i would definitely look elsewhere first, but the price and location would be hard to beat.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''room - good. having worked in the building before it was converted into a hotel i was surprised how little work was actually done as part of the conversion. modern rooms, minimalist. limited amenities. and yes the mini bar is just not worth it | room service - efficient and polite but the food was disappointing both in quality and taste | bathroom - shower pressure was it great but otherwise fine | view - lovely | overall - expensive and disappointing for what was delivered. has the promise to be something more but quality needs to be invested in. would recommend one aldwych instead of this hotel. | top top - check your bill in detail as there were several mistakes and the combination of some items including vat and others not made it difficult to explain the charges for the check out'''",1
The Savoy,"'''stayed at the savoy last friday night with friends and whilst it was ok, i had expected something a little special. we started with champagne in the american bar which was great until an american waitress started to clear our glasses away before we had finished, having already spent 150 on 2 bottles i thought this was very poor! we went out for dinner and returned to the hotel around 11.00 for a drink but were turned away from the bar area as there was a waiting time. this is fine however they were letting other people in who obviously fitted in better than we did. room again was ok but at 350 you would not call it value for money, breakfast however was very good!'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''arrived at about 12.30 so did not expect room to be ready so checked in bags and went for a walk along south bank and had a pleasant lunch at the camel and artichoke near waterloo station. wandered back to hotel about 2.30, room still not ready but just being checked over - check in is officially 3.00 but they did know we were there! after sitting in lobby for 20 minutes asked again but room was still not ready. when it was eventually sorted about 3.15 we were given key and a young man showed us to our room - very pleasant but did not bother to offer to take our case! when showed to our room it turned out to be a disabled room. we were in a hurry so did not say anything till we returned later in the afternoon. at that point another non disabled room was allocated and staff were surprised we had not been asked if we would take a disabled room. the new room was ok but nothing special, there was only 1 bath robe, the alarm clock had stopped, there was no minibar price list. the bed is only queen size at most - even premier inn give you a kingsize and the view, even on the 9th floor was of a building site - you could see the tip of the shard though! | the hotel is well located for the south bank, we walked the thames path up to tower bridge and saw the amazing poppy sculpture at the tower, then back down the north bank to the embankment pier where we crossed the river and returned past the london eye. the decor is interesting but wished they had spent more attention on looking after guests and less trying to be cool. the hotel is poorly signed, especially at the back entrance where you arrive by road. | we did have a nice meal in the evening at rsj about a 10 minute walk and would certainly go there again but unfortunately will not bother with mondrian next time. | also beware the website which advertises prices excluding vat (mentioned in the small print!)'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this hotel is located in a safe area with a college town feel, and only a few minutes away from several tube stations (goodge, euston). i stayed in a first floor room just off the main reception area (no ensuite bathroom), and even though it was small it was very clean with enough counter space. there was a lot of traffic and people noise from the outside street with the window open but in october, this was not really an issue. breakfast was simple but good, though you do not get to serve yourself. wifi in my room was terrible and did not work, but you can get reliable connection in the lounge. staff was very friendly and accommodating - overall, i would recommend the ridgemount to budget travelers who do not want to take out a second mortgage in order to visit london.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''this was my first visit to the iconic dorchester. i had an executive room for 2 nights for work. check in was okay but the sweet irish clerk was so anxious that he asked me most questions more than once. endlessly asking how my day was, my journey was, i was (etc) just is not required. i expect he was just following his training.....but there in lies the problem with the dorchester....more of that shortly, dear reader. | my room was fine. it was at the back on a high floor but still noisy. the bathroom was awesome but the rest of the amenities no better than sofitel or mercure. in fact, given the extraordinary price of the room, i was disappointed with the lack of mineral water, fruit, a tea tray, a trouser press and so on. there was, of course, a massive 'mini bar' (poor english, sorry) containing everything you can imagine. on day 2, the room was not properly serviced. | i had dinner and drinks at the bar. the promenade bar is disappointing. the furniture is cheap, faux antique junk shop stuff and battered. the prices are typical of central london and the staff (with exception of caesar) patronising (again, endless but false and insincere questions about my 'day'). caesar obviously skipped the training and is natural and has an intact personality! thank goodness! | food in the restaurant was average. | breakfast was a disaster in the promenade. again, endless insincere questions about my sleep patterns (!) and very slow service. one french staff member had obviously been on the training course about advising customers where to visit in london! given that i lived in london for 30 years i was keen to hear his recommendations.....it was priceless.....""there is not much to do in london on a saturday (sic) so i would recommend portobello market"". no comment. | there is a very small gym, which i used but its only just adequate. | this hotel really is living on its' reputation. they need some local staff who can welcome staff properly to london. they need to radically review their training and 'ditch' their training by rote. | i would not stay here again and do not recommend it - especially for the price.'''",1

A To Z Hotel,'''this is an excellent hotel not too far away from london transport is average in the area had a good week stay here. the only problem is worth that i could see was the breakfasts only consisted of toast and coffee with butter and jam and they only provided a kettle in my room but no mug i would not expect them to provide tea and coffee at the price i paid but a cup or mug would have been nice so if you stay here do not forget to take one of your own very clean although basic hotel was very good value for money''',1
The Savoy,"'''this is a bustling brash and bright hotel. but i cannot understand why, compared to so many other world class luxury hotels all over the world, every body seems so delighted with the savoy. i wish i had the experience where i felt i was so well looked after and there was an extraordinary attention to detail. my experience was different. to me, it seemed the hotel was serviced by a giant hierarchy of staff and management. i felt as if the entire enterprise ran on information relays from one staff member to the other....either via texts or earpieces. it did not seem to me that there was any sense of intuitive service. every time i asked a question it seemed as if a lower level employee had to check the answer with his supervisor and so on. | while the lobby is really amazing....it is more like a little city. it is over the top in its bubbly mood but there is no consistently high level of style nor sterling service and no one can say reliably that a posh crowd is to be found at the savoy. i do not care if there is a famous face or there is not. but it seems to be a rather key fixation of many of my fellow guests at the savoy. ultimately who hangs out in the lobby or ""foyer"" or in the bars is not the litmus test for me. because whomever is in the lobby, crowding up the bars, has really very little to do with the hotel that ""team savoy"" is running upstairs. sadly there was a good deal i did not like about being a registered guest. | i did not like when i was checking in that the young lady, even with all her smiles, seemed as if she is absolutely gloating: after all, this must be any new savoy guest's splurge of a lifetime... i have had many once in a lifetime experiences. thank goodness my special check-in experience with this vaguely snobbish young lady and my actual underwhelming overnight stay at the savoy does not even come anywhere near such a list. but, i can assure you, this is a huge turn-off. this young lady acting as if it is her business to make you sit up and notice that you are now enjoying your first experience in a five star hotel. | the first time i had my name embossed on hotel stationery was at the peninsula beverly hills in 1995. but somehow this is meant to impress. i would be more impressed if the deluxe river front room i reserved for a rather hefty premium, strictly for the view, actually came with the view i was promised. i will admit i am saddened and dismayed that there seems to be lower expectations for this hotel than for other hotels in london. | after all, i booked my stay based mostly on the hundreds of reviews about how this is the greatest place. once i arrived and i realized i was not going to be bowled over by the in-room check-in process (which really is a silly gimmick at best) or the personalized stationary or the alarmingly smallish room without the benefit of the very expensive view i was promised would be out my window, i figured all that is great must be too subtle. i checked further. the bathroom was nice but no nicer than many other bathrooms in first rate hotels. and i have seen some that really put this one to shame. the bed.....well all beds are just delicious in brand new expensive hotels. one time, in a hotel in manhattan, i slept in a bed that was so unbelievable i felt like a princess and asked if i could purchase the duvet. the duvet was 3000. i can promise you, the fairmont hotel chain is not putting those duvets on the beds at the savoy. i looked around the rooms and searched for anything so,charming, so singular as to make this rooms feel luxurious. i do not know what is so superlative at the savoy because there really was not one thing that was superior to any experience i had already had at so many other hotels. the beaufort bar is gorgeous. the foyer is lovely. but if you can sit in a glorious over-the-top setting at one famous hotel in mayfair (where paparazzi are always waiting) with a superbly turned out crowd, (but only ho-hum rooms upstairs) or in another mayfair hotel with a refined and restrained atmosphere and an equally elegant ambience why stay at the savoy? i would say it is because the experience at the savoy and the rooms would be absolutely knock-down gorgeous and the service so brilliant, so intuitive that it set new standards for london. the memory of the savoy in it is heyday, with its starry crowds or a celebrity reliably in place every night of the week, is formidable. such a grand hotel. a place for laughs and drinks and good times. and being well looked after! where is that place? the new over used word: ""bespoke"" service. i am sorry but i am one of a very small minority of guests that did not get that feeling. ""bespoke"" rooms, baths, bedding, decor. to me, it was all just disappointing. all marketing that really worked amazingly well. the entire experience was so much less grand and the room really needed that river view (which i never did get) in order to reach any sort of memorable status. oh, i also dislike the location. i only mention it because it is one criteria by which we are supposed to judge the hotel. to me, the savoy is in a kind of tawdry area. closer to covent garden it is more interesting.'''",1

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''many years ago i worked in the city and my wife and i thought it would be fun to have a weekend in london to look around old haunts and so forth. we selected the hotel as one on the edge of the city, but from which we could get to other parts of the capital. that worked a treat. | a good, clean, modern hotel with welcoming staff. good breakfast and nice room. | however, if you are suffering from depression do not visit - the hotel decor, and rooms particularly, has been modernistically over-designed to within an inch of its mental health. low lighting levels combined with uniformly dark carpets and fittings gives the place a gloomy air. it is trendily kitted out to the point of losing the point. | also, why the bar has two televisions and a sound system playing different things simultaneously is beyond fathoming. | value for money? only just, but that is london hotel pricing for you.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''it is not cheap. it is a great building. the rooms are good and the beds very comfortable. it should be a 'wow' experience but... | my family - myself, my wife and two teenagers (19 and 18yrs.) - stayed for a couple of nights for a christmas treat. | as we queued to book in there were four members of staff behind the reception desk; two booking people in and another two busying themselves with paperwork and computer screens. not a glance in our direction; not a word; not a decision to concentrate on the guest first before the paperwork. 'let them queue, we have more important things to do.' | on returning from a shopping expedition at 4.30 (do not you just love hamley's?) the teenagers collapsed in front of the tv while my wife and i went in search of a cup of tea in the bar on the ground floor. the person seating guests showed us to a table that had used crockery on it, saw us seated and disappeared, leaving the crockery in place. | we decided to move and asked the same person if there was anywhere else we could get tea. 'in the rumpus room', she replied so we went up to the 12th floor to find it. it was closed. it opens at 5pm. so, we waited. once it opened - 5mins late - we asked for tea only to be told that they do not serve tea in the rumpus room! | we went out for dinner that evening to 'gourmet pizza' (a very different story) and on return my wife ordered cheesecake on room service. it was, to quote her, 'the worst cheesecake i have ever had in my life'. | the following day on our return from the theatre and knowing that the rumpus room only allows in guests over the age of 21, we took the teenagers to the ground floor bar under the assumption that, as it was not stated in any of the literature, they would be allowed in. oh, no. we were ejected on the grounds of their age. when we raised this issue the next morning when we checked out, we were assured that they should have been allowed in. | our room service (cheesecake) payment was removed from the bill. | i left my wallet (nothing of value in it) and a key in the safe when we left. i am being charged for them to return it. you will take your own view on this but if i was running a hotel there is no way i would charge a guest postage under those circumstances. | i do realise that these all sound like first world problems but there is clearly something amiss when staff are unclear about the way the place runs, when service is slapdash and when food is that bad!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''our trip was for my 50th birthday i love london and was looking forward to the trip. on check in we where told that we had been upgraded, cool i taught, now do not get all excited the upgrade was just a bigger bed, the room was clean but cramped probably because of upgrade bed. after going for a walk we returned at 17.30 to find restaurant closed, but food available in lounge. no problem there or so i thaught. my wife needs a gluten free diet, i asked the guy at the bar, do you cater for gluten free diet. i clearley disturbed him at what was an empty bar. i will have to ask the chef, off he went, on his return the one and only answer was ""it depends on what you order"" that i could have worked out myself. every where else the tell you what you can have on the menu. i have traveled extensively across europe and american. this is by far worst personal service. pity nice hotel good location.'''",1
The Dorchester,'''i stayed in the hotel on a very short trip to london. i was checking in early morning and was to check out later in the day. the duty manager lady was checking me in and asked to provide a deposit to cover cost of room and another 150 for incidentals. i gave her cash dollars to cover the deposit. however she refused to give me a receipt for the cash. this was not acceptable and only on my insistence and threatening to walk out she grudgingly gave me a hand written receipt. her behaviour was bordering on rudeness. not a pleasent experience for an early morning check in after a long flight. the quality of room was very good but attitude of staff spoilt the stay.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this hotel is emphatically not targeted at me. | it is laid back vibe (is often too laid back resulting in ineffective service) and contrasting architecture (millennium modern interior / 1960's office exterior) is for someone that is not that bothered with the finer things in life. | there has been a rise of this type of hotel in london of late, and if it is your cup of tea, this is certainly not one of the worst. | the room my son and i stayed at, was situated in the rear of the building. it was small, dark, adequate but overlooked a building site that will soon be offices or flats overlooking the room. not appealing in either case. | the new build was showing it is bedding in teething problems, sticky doors, creaking pipes, entry door systems not working and a constant flow of repairmen up and down the corridor to fix them. | the breakfast food was fine, pleasant but not exceptional, but after a few days in the hotel (we stayed 6 nights) the breakfast offering was getting very samey. | there is no question that the experience of drinking in the dandelyan bar is something else. these are cocktails on frankly a different level to pretty much anything else available in london. but you do not need to stay at the hotel to experience it. | yes the hotel has a cinema, but it was not open for the duration of our stay, only being available over the weekend. | as much as this hotel advertises offers for families, it is american ownership means that all bars are off limits to under 21's (especially the rumpus room where the views are to be had) and as there is no swimming pool, very little in house for children/teenagers to do (though there are free vintage video game machines in the basement near the cinema). | the problem as ever, is with the price, a room here could cost you as much as staying in the ritz, waldorf or savoy and frankly it does not compare. it neither has the attentive service of its competitors nor their history or grandeur. | this is a hotel for those with a little more money than sense. | yes it is got the bar, but if you are looking for a modern hotel to hang out in the me hotel on aldwych has it beat hands down. the radio bar has magnificent views over the thames (best in london) unlike the mondrian's rumpus bar that just overlooks st.paul's, the me is in the west end, the mondrian on southbank and actually not that easy to get too. the me has all rooms with views over central london, the mondrian just those rooms at the front of the building offer any kind of views at all (with a premium price to reflect it). | my son and i were treated extremely well by management and it was a pleasant stay, but at these prices it should have been an exceptional stay and quite frankly, it was not'''",1

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''expectations were high when we checked in using the fine hotels and resorts program from american express, which promises a free upgrade, when available. i asked the young woman registering us if we had been upgraded and she assured me that we had, but this was not true. the two rooms we received were exactly of the category we had reserved. i was peeved about this and made note that the hotel was far from full. most of the rooms on our floor did not have newspapers or do not disturb signs, and the elevators and lounges were not heavily occupied--all a clear indication that there were likely better rooms available. i have not yet sent my feedback to amex, but they should know that the corinthia misrepresented the rooms as an upgrade. | the rooms were beautifully designed and furnished, very luxurious and well thought out. however, the bathrobe provided surprisingly had several tears in the lapel. i draped it over the chair to expose the problem, and the next day the housekeeper had put it right back on the hook in the bathroom. sloppy! | we had a good late dinner at massimo's-- a beautiful room, but the service was sorely lacking. our wine and water glasses were not refilled without repeated requests, and the food took a very long time to appear. yes, it was late, but the prices do not go down as the evening wears on, and neither should the service. | even worse was the breakfast the following morning, when we were herded into a waiting area, and after a half hour had been jammed into a tiny table next to a sea of dirty dishes and not served a thing. the manager apologized and said she had been brought in to rectify the service, which was clearly a problem. the table was reset, and we finally ate, but the experience left us convinced that our breakfast the following day would be via room service. | finally, i inadvertently left behind a pair of shoes and have had repeated correspondence with the housekeeping department at the hotel trying to get them sent back to me. apparently, they require an authorization to use my credit card to ship them to me, with no estimate of the cost or limit on the price they will charge. | the hotel is beautiful, the staff was friendly, and the night engineer was kind enough to deliver some batteries to my room for a luggage scale i had purchased. i travel to london often, and usually stay at smaller boutique hotels where the attention to detail is better. the corinthia is very beautiful, but there is definitely room for improvement. | if management reads this review, please let me know how i can reclaim my shoes without spending more than they are worth!'''",1

Newham Hotel,"'''we booked this hotel for one night only as it was very close to olympic stadium and we wanted to go to the anniversary games. the hotel was a bit tired looking in parts but, in my opinion, worth the money we paid. the staff were very helpful and welcoming, especially on arrival and explained how everything worked etc., the breakfast was really good and plenty to choose from. our room was basic but everything really clean - e.g. toilet and shower, bedding etc. i thought we could have done a lot worse and would recommend if you were staying in this area this hotel is more than adequate. yes in need of a bit of decor and basic but what else do you need! for one night this was clean, adequate and a very good price.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i expect much more from a 5 star hotel. unfortunately my journey was marked by different small inconvenient things. first of all - every monday at 11am they turn on the fire alarm for 20 seconds. they say i had to receive a warning about this on tv, too bad i did not watch the tv the night before. they have only 1 european plug in the room quite far from the bed. it took me 10 minutes of insisting with the concierge to get an adaptor. | for 3 nights i alway set the same temperature in the room, but at different hours during the night i had different temperatures in the room. so at 11pm i was cold, at 5am i was hot and at 9am i was ok. | i do not want to say the hotel is bad, but it was definitely below my expectations.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''me and my girlfriend stayed from the 21st until the 23rd july whilst visiting london for a gig. | after a short walk from the tube station (c.20min) first impressions of the hotel were good. | the room was clean and well presented, if slightly unremarkable. generally it has everything you would need but nothing more, save for a mobile device which comes with the room and acts as a kind of 'tour guide in your pocket' - this is quite cool, but then i suppose i would just be able to use my phone for the same thing. | on the first night we are in a bit of a rush to get ready and get out so we could have a stroll around camden before our gig - unfortunately our progress was hampered by the shower being blocked. this resulted in the bathroom flooding. we called the front desk, and an engineer was sent up within 20 minutes. we then had to wait for a cleaner. the problem was a small one - however in a five star hotel i would suggest this is pretty unacceptable. it was an inconvenience and meant we did not have the time we would have liked before the gig. | the second issue was on the second night when we decided to buy a film to watch as my girlfriend was not felling very well. this turned out to be a mistake, as the tv system was a shambles - every time we paused the film the whole system would crash - and we soon realised we would had to turn the tv on and off at the plug to resolve the issue. this culminated in me getting very frustrated, as it had pushed the film into the early hours, and i ended up ringing the front desk and asking for a refund. we never saw the end of the film. in fairness they duly obliged, and were apologetic - but again, worthy of a 5 star hotel ? i personally do not think so. | the breakfast was good, but again, nothing special - service was quite slow and one both days i had eaten most of my breakfast before i was offered (or managed to get the attention of a waiter to ask for) tea or coffee. i found i had to search out staff to request sauces, and on the first day the bacon was beyond crispy - the sort of crispy which borders on inedible. on the second day we ate out on the decking along the river - this was a nice touch. | in short - our stay was unfortunately marred by a couple of avoidable hiccups - hence the 3 stars. but even without those - this hotel does not meet the standard of other 5 star hotels we have stayed at.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''we booked the hotel through amex platinum and they should give us early check in, late check out and an upgrade if available. the oriental lady (chinese?) , who did not introduce herself , at the concierge was all time very sorry but could not do anything. well, nothing happened. we waited until 3:30 pm to enter our small room, there was no upgrade and it was a poor experience. small gym, few machines, disappointing breakfast, bad timing ( they always took an eternity so serve the plate and the latte or capuccino was in the end cold and the never offered a new one) . one day, with a do not disturb sign a lady entered our room with a bottle of water ??? hello ???? cannot you read the sign ? and i have not asked for water!!! | my advice, if you want to big spend and be pampered in london choose somewhere else!'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''my friend and i stayed here for one night in a twin en-suite room. the room was clean and spacious, and the shower was better than i would expect for the level of establishment. | there is plenty of parking at the front and back of the hotel. | the staff at reception were friendly and helpful. | the only negative is that there was not enough seating for breakfast, it was only in a small room, so we could not have any. when we looked at what was on offer we were not too upset that we could not eat, as it did not look very appetizing. | also there was not a lift so i had to drag my suitcases up some narrow stairs. | but overall, good value hotel.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''location is great but the rooms are tiny and the beds also tiny. we arrived mid morning after a 24 hour flight and would have loved to have been able to freshen up a little before check in time but had to leave baggage and go out in a fog of jetlag for 4 hours before being able to check in. after checking in we had to drag our bags (for a family of 4) up 6 flights of stairs. the top floor room or any that face the street are quite noisy, the traffic is constant throughout most of the night but ear plugs can resolve that problem. breakfast is quick and the staff really friendly, though if you need any fruit there will not be any on the menu, although the nearest tesco express near russel square sells cheap fruit if you need a fix on your way out. it is very ordinary but for the price and location it is a good deal. really when in london you would hardly spend anytime in the room anyway so it ticks all the boxes in being in walking distance to everything. no wifi on top floor.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i stayed at the savoy and all the ""ingredients"" were impressive. however, to pay close to 500gbp for a room with a view of an old building just across the backstreet and hardly any storage place to put your bathroom utensils (no shelf) feels a bit like unattractive value.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we arrived at the hotel late evening after a long journey, i reserved a supreme three bed room . they gave us a room in the basement with no air no room to moove a moldy smell and the wifi did not work . i was very dissapointed since we were booked for a week! after a terrible night i demanded to be mooved to another room , i was told it was my fault since i did not make a request not to be in the basement! in the end they did moove us to the second floor and even mooved our suitcases to the new room i must remind you that there is no elevator , so this was a nice gesture. the new room was much better more air more space and the bathroom is renovated. there is also a big tv, fridge and a kettle with tea and coffe and wifi. the location in quite good with hyde park near and good transportation near the hotel. the breakfast is included it is in a very small room but you have a variety of food toast fruits cheese etc. the staff was mostly friendly . i felt you could find a better hotel in london.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''it was an interesting hotel, because by description it had everything, but it is quite small and cramped. i could barely fit my laptop on the desk for instance. i think for a night or two close to paddington it is fine, but i have stayed in several hotels in this area and they were nicer. | the breakfast was again, everything you might want, but quality, quantity not up to usual uk standards.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this is an interesting and different hotel. our room was spacious with comfortable beds and pillows. | the shower, which is inside the bath, was incredible annoying as there was no way to get the right balance of hot/cold right. the small shampoo bottles have been used so many times they felt old. | on returning to the hotel on a friday night we asked reception if there was a decent traditional pub nearby. we were told that there was not one anywhere near and we should try one of the hotels two bars. we said we had and they were not to our liking as we wanted a proper pub. we were told that were no pubs within walking distance which seemed strange. | so we left the hotel anyway and the doorman pointed us in the direction of a lovely pub overlooking the river about a 3 minute walk away. | so reception staff either need to learn more about their local neighbourhood or stop lying to guests! | for the price i have had better experiences in london hotels.'''",1
Hartley Hotel,"'''budget room was ok for money spent. walks of room look line it us being got ready to be decorated. disappointed that in a room for 4 people there was only two cups with the coffee making facilities and only one glass, did not say anything as was only staying one night. no hot water and free wifi did not work. breakfast was good.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''if you have ever stayed in a las vegas hotel you will have an idea of what style this hotel has gone for. in some ways it is great but in other ways it is tacky glitz. | it goes without saying it is expensive, the service was professional but the staff seemed a bit on edge, but maybe that was understandable as it had only just opened. the breakfast was good but i was expecting something on a par with the dorchester which it was not. | the room was nice but the lights blew a fuse and about 5am we were woken by delivery lorries. | as the savoy is a bit of a tourist attraction we could not get into the american bar, so we went to the beaufort bar instead which was good, but we had to wait an age to get a drink and this is where the coat system seems a bit bonkers as when we went to leave they did not have our coats we had have a search of the cloakroom to find them. | on check out, they wanted to charge us again, but we had already pre-paid, which was a bit annoying computer says no, but we got there in the end. | all in all its not bad, but it is not the exceptional savoy i was expecting. i had never stayed in the original but it is hard to see the new version gaining a similar reputation.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i like vintage, masive furniture, but the standard rooms are too small for it. the big minus was the view from my room. i was facing a window from the other wing. not what i had in mind. the more you pay, the better room you have. my friend was accommodated in a suite facing hyde park. oh, wow! that is mandarin! | but i had a pleasant stay, the hotel is impressive and it is very close to the park.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here with my daughter as we were in london to see a show. i was very disappointed with the hotel in general. our room was very small even though it was supposed to be a superior, i would not like to see a standard room. we went to the bar for a drink after the theatre and got the distinct impression we were an inconvenience. breakfast was a sorry affair, very crammed and full, though that cannot be helped if everyone arrives at once. however the food selection was not replenished very quickly,meaning we missed out. some tables were very close to the buffet meaning you got people pushing past and queuing whilst you were trying to eat. all in all i have stayed in nicer places for similar money in london. it was walking distance to harrods but not sure that made up for the rest.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this hotel is very clean, beds are comfy and the location is good, although gower street is narrow, very congested and fume choked. but the bedroom was so small there was no room for a wardrobe. it was very cramped for 2 people with a bag each. when we asked about a bigger room we were told that they were all of a similar size: then the proprietor changed his mind and said there was a bigger room but it would cost more. as we were on a budget and did not feel like packing all our stuff up again, we decided to stay put. we did not have an en suite. the shower on our floor was so tiny it was almost unusable. two bathrooms on the floor below were bigger but we had to queue with a bunch of american kids to use them. no lift although our heavy bags were taken up to 3rd floor for us when we arrived. breakfast can only be described as uninteresting, and was rationed. no fresh ( or dried) fruit or yoghurts. the female waitresses were very pleasant. two of the reception staff were also very helpful. the owner seems a bit indifferent. i do not think he has to try very hard because the hotel is always full. ? perhaps some competition nearby in the same price bracket would help the consumer. you get what you pay for they say, but we did not think the price of 75 or so for the twin room per night was good value. we would not stay there again.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''in a hotel which is meant to be world class, i could not believe the lack of little luxuries ... you can buy top quality chocolates in the hotel shop yet, in your room. you are offered a snickers bar, kit kat etc for which you are charged as much as 7. in the bathroom, the shampoo and conditioner bottles are branded savoy but they are the same size as any three star hotel. this is penny-pinching. the choice at breakfast is very, very wide but the traditional english breakfast was a real disappointment . i expected the very best of english bacon, sausage, black pudding but what i ate was just above average fair. even the toast was sliced brown and white! | the hotel feels almost corporate and, apart from the stunning architecture and the very friendly, courteous and efficient staff, it is not unlike most american-owned hotels around the world even down to men wearing shorts in the restaurant which, i believe, shows standards are slipping. | i wonder what alex polizzi or her mother would make of the recently refurbished savoy - now their family knows what a truly luxurious hotel looks and feels like.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the hotel is beautiful, but there is not a clear enough sign in front. i walked by twice before i found where i was going. as soon as i arrived i was whisked upstairs and there were no real complaints about the room. compared to other london hotels it bordered on spacious. the closet space leaves something to be desired if you are trying to cram in several suits. my only complaint with the facilities is the shower. it is extremely chic, but it is cold unless you are standing directly under the stream of water. some of the service was not great either. i was out late for business events every night and was still getting ready in the morning when housekeeping did their first pass. i came back at least 5 hours later to do some work and nobody had gotten to the room. i called housekeeping and asked if someone could come up because i would be going out for 45min. i came back nearly 2 hours later and they still had not come, but i needed to work. i called again. they finally showed up and i asked them to only do the bed and the bathroom. that still took them nearly 30 minutes. when we got room service we called to have the cart removed. nobody came for over an hour. we called again and then just pushed it into the hall. it is beautiful, but i think it makes a better crash pad during a busy business trip than a hotel where you might have to actually stay in the room during the day. also, not much variety in the minibar.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i stayed at this hotel for a little under a week for business. the property location is outstanding and the service is first class albeit a bit stuffy. however, the rooms and my stay overall were underwhelming. the property has great charm and character but realize that this is a historic building. during my stay, the hotel was without water for more than a half day. i was sent to the spa to shower only to find they too were without water. not what i expected from a 5 star hotel but i understand that such things happen. what i did not expect or appreciate was that there was never any offer, concession, or accommodation offered for this major inconvenience. even a small token would have been a good guest relations move. overall, i was treated very well, high tea was amazing, but i am not sure this would be my first choice in hotels on my next trip.'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''when you pay 850 quids for a night, you sort of expect the room to be ready when you check in at the 3pm advertized time. if the room is not ready, which might happen, you sort of expect not to be let to dry off on a chair without an offer for a complimentary glass of water or cup of coffee. the rest was ok, great yet smallish room with zero view contrarily to what i was led to believe, perfect service. as with so many such top notch 5**** hotels, if you only stay for a night, you are a 2nd class citizen compared to their uber-wealthy long-stay customers. quid for quid, holiday inn is probably a better option.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''i would visited the restaurant and bar a few times so was looking forward to staying in one of the rooms when i noticed a deal online. the room decor is not on the same level as the downstairs - it feels more like a citizen m or trendy budget hotel. i found the colour scheme unpleasant and jarring. the facilities are good - and appreciated the malin &amp; goetz toiletries - but there is no way i would pay the full room rate here.''',1
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''a very nice boutique hotel with great location but it has 2 cigar lounges off the lobby so even though they try to enclose them, the bar and the lounge are unusable unless you do not mind the reek of cigar smoke. even walking through the small lobby in the evening to your room results in the smell permeating your clothes. if you do not mind this, then by all means stay here. but it is sad, with all the efforts made in the past to clear public areas of smoke, that guests and staff have to endure this unpleasantness. and if you use starwood (now marriott) points, you may wind up in a handicapped equipped room; not bad and the bathroom is quite large but a 6x12 inch sink makes it all be unusable.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''my works colleague and i were invited to dinner at the hotel and decided to stay over night as opposed to staying at the ritz or the mayfair where we would usually reside. each and every member of staff we encountered were friendly, welcoming and very customer focused. i was allocated room 315 that was an internal facing room and whilst of a good size for a base entry room, is not really to the standard of decor as that of where we would typically stay. the bed was extremely comfortable though. being an internal facing room and the hotel being under renovation, there was scaffolding directly outside of the frosted our windows which workmen were working during my stay for which could be clearly heard working and talking - for which some of the language shouted was pretty colourful to say the least. my colleague and i both left disappointed with the quality of the bedroom accommodation that lacked the feeling of luxury. dinner is hestons was excellent and it was lovely taking breakfast overlooking hyde park.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''they insist on debiting 100 from your card after you have paid in full. this is for a deposit. but instead on just putting a hold on the money they actually debit it from our account. this was not refunded till 10 days after. and only after several phone calls. was fuming. close to stealing your money.''',1
The Savoy,"'''went to kaspers for a late lunch last sunday. as a regular of the savoy champagne bar my expectations were high. our food was all good and some of the dishes beautifully presented. my fish pie however, was 90% potatoes and 10% fish hidden at the bottom of the dish. the staff however, were untidy, stains down there vests, shirt collars undone shirt tails bunched up out the back of their trousers etc. | the staff of a restaurant if this caliber should be immaculate. i did speak to one waiter peter, who was nicely turned out and he told me he absolutely agreed and has mentioned it several times to the manager. i would have but the manager was very noticeable by his absence. for a restaurant of this calibre and price, would i go back again? i doubt it.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel was nice, but your only paying for the location (knightsbridge) as it was not great. rooms were small, our jacuzzi bath did not work and we had a view of a brick wall outside our window! | would not stay here again.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i have to be honest, the hotel, installations, rooms... are stunning. but that is not the only thing that i pay attention to when i am a guest. | the first day that i went down for breakfast i did not notice there were a reception and i get into the room to look for a waiter and the woman behind the desk start running after me shouting: hey!hey! where are you going? | could not believe someone from the staff being so rude in a hotel like this. | 5 min later they made the same with a young man, shouting so loudly that he was atonished. | will not come back! | i prefer humble hotels with lovely staff.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i stayed at this hotel in this property in march 2015 with my brother. | the room was serviceable, even if a little small, i found the blue light in the bathroom to be slightly disconcerting (i chose to believe that it was to protect one's eyes when making a midnight visit, rather than a cunning plan to stop drug use). everyone i spoke to at the hotel was polite and helpful. | the hotel was a convenient walking distance to the tube, hyde park and paddington station. | breakfast was average, but satisfactory, the selection was not as wide as we experienced elsewhere. | i also found it to be slightly odd that we were expected to leave the key whenever we left the hotel - this was not an issue in practice, but i can imagine that it would be if you happened to return to your room while they were checking in new guests or on the phone. | depending on offers available at the time - i would consider staying here again.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''a good, solid hotel. great location 5 minutes from the south kensington tube station, which will get you just about anywhere (3 tube lines). 500 meters from harrods. just south of hyde park. directly across the street from the victoria &amp; albert. breakfast was great. good quality, great selection, quick, convenient. staff was friendly and eager to help. shower was terrific (gravity and wand). so, why not 5 stars? when we arrived in the morning, we were told we could not check in (perfectly understandable), but would be upgraded to a nicer room with a large bay window. when we got back at the end of the day, the upgrade did not happen. we were given a room on the first floor which was newly renovated (that was great), but small and with furnishings that, to be honest, did not seem to be planned for that room. an extra round table and chair that did not belong anywhere. no drawers in which to unpack if you wanted. a baggage stand, but no room to open it, etc. tv remote was fickle. biggest problem was regulating temperature. this was the first cold spell, and apparently the heat was cranked up to the max. our room was too warm, and no amount of work on the thermostat (by me or staff) adequately addressed the problem. and the windows in our room did not open. so, it just stayed a bit too warm. i will emphasize that staff tried to fix the problem, and i think they would have moved us to another room if i would pressed, but we were just too tired. all in all, a good hotel in a great location, if you can just avoid the temperature problem.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the hotel itself is nice and clean, the breakfast is nice but there are a few major problems with the hotel: | 1. our room was not in the main building of the hotel but rather in another building located a few minutes' walk from the main one. | 2. our room was at the 4th floor of the hotel with no elevator. the staircases are narrow and it is not easy to bring the luggage upstairs. also. every time you want to go back to your room you need to climb 4 floors, and it is not easy if you are not fit. | 3. the wi-fi in our room was bad. most of the time it was slow, and we had a lot of reception problems, and it kept disconnecting all the time.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''my husband and i recently stayed at the savoy for 8 nights. we planned this trip as a celebration and i was so excited to stay in such a lovely and historic hotel..sadly i was dissappointed. we arrived after a long flight exhausted and ready to check in to our room,however our room was not ready so we were told we could possibly have to wait two hours. the savoy staff sent us emails before our stay asking us what time we would arrive so our room could be ready.we were told we could dine at one of the restaurants,even though we were not hungry we decided to eat because at least we could relax while we waited for our room. we decided to eat in the thames foyer where they serve breakfast and tea, the hostess was so rude looking at us as if we had no right to be there and sent us to the american bar. the american bar was lovely and we were treated better. after a long wait we finally got to our room which was described as a private balcony suite. the room was lovely but small,definitely not a suite. the balcony was dirty and had clearly not been prepared for our arrival. i feel the room was not represented honestly on the website,it was fine but just fine certainly not worth the amount we paid. the food was just ok and the service was stiff. i never felt comfortable. i would not stay at the savoy again.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''location and staff were excellent, they could have not been more helpful. room was excellent. however the day we arrived we decided to eat lunch at the bar, one word, awful..... we ordered turkey sandwiches and what we were served was disgraceful, the sandwich consisted of brown turkey meat (cheap) on toast covered with cheese.. it looked as if it was sitting there a long time. presentation, none, and it tasted awful! it arrived out on the plate with no side salad or garnish whatsoever , all this for 13 or 14 pound what a rip off! they might have redeemed themselves a bit if it had come with sides, which one would expect for that price. one would expect that a good chef would have a bit more imagination than that, when sandwiches that you buy on the go like in airports etc taste 100 times better and a third of the price, there must be something wrong!'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i used to stay at the savoy, when visiting from australia. the ""new"" savoy gets too many things wrong under american fairmont management | when booking they fail to include vat at the quoting stage, so when you get to book there is a surprise extra 20% added. most hotels tell you the full price when you ask. their ""reason"" was that some businessmen like to add the vat themselves! | the price does not include wifi (but they did eventually include it for me) | they sent me an email a few days before, to ask what time i would be checking in. when i replied 1 to 3 pm, i got an officious reply pointing out that 2 pm was the checkin time | i have checked in to more than a thousand hotels, and did not need that. i dropped my bags there at 11.30 and went off to lunch | a few days before arriving i asked for a reservation for afternoon tea, and was told they were fully booked, even for residents. so i reserved for the following day, and took my nephew to the corinthia and we had a much better tea, in a calmer almosphere for slightly less | when i went to the savoy tea the next day it was a similar circus to breakfast, with staff wandering through with a computer printer and a vacuum cleaner! | back in my room, there was no comfortable chair for reading and tv viewing. i asked for one, and they delivered one, but i am surprised after a year, they had chairs as an on request option | on the sunday morning i went for a swim, and was told to change in the ladies as there were some repairs going on in the gentlemen's change room. i was happy to do so, but added to all the other ""small things"" it was an irritation | the doorbell of the room was very quiet..not audible if the tv was on. as a result, room service came in while i was naked in the bath. not the sort of thing you expect at the savoy, and maybe their procedures need review | and as steve jobs would say, one more thing... | the bill was wrong. they charged me for two breakfasts when there was just one of me...on the bedlam day with no service | so i shall not be returning to the savoy, nor commending it to others | the wifi however was very feeble, and dropped out...only working reliably if you stood very close to the door. | breakfast was a madhouse and i was waiting 15 minutes for any food to appear. i was still charged the 12% service charge they forgot to include in the pricing'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''thought the place was over designed and the staff was try too hard to be hip. which was all a bit styled until the french manager kicked off at the barista for some misdemeanour at breakfast and the greeter kicked off at the waitress for not clearing tables. not very hipster. oh and the receptionist trying to charge 50 for two breakfasts at checkout when it is in the room rate not very hipster. all the grey paint in the rooms and corridors is depressive not very hipster.''',1
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''the hotel is excellent but what i observe they have quite a lot new staff in their hotel and probably they are not properly trained to listen customer properly and then end up with some unpleasant experience. | so in nutshell | amenities - 4 star | hospitality - 3 star | staff - need better training''',1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''my partner and i were there for three nights towards the end of june. location: great central area to stay in, not far from all the most popular tourist attractions. there is a great cafe and many restaurants nearby as well as places to buy a sim card if you are from overseas. service: our dealings were mostly with the father and son, who were friendly enough and helpful - particularly the father, who went out of his way to let us know about train lines that were down and assist on the best way to get around. breakfast serving staff were these really lovely and courteous portuguese ladies. accommodation: clean and serviced daily. the beds were comfortable enough, but tiny. we supposedly had a double bed, but it really was not. fortunately, we walked everywhere and were so exhausted each night, it did not bother us as much as it normally would. i would recommend couples ask for a twin room if one's available. there is a guest room near the entry hall with a couple of couches and a computer terminal with free internet access. breakfast: the breakfast each morning was adequate, but a bit ordinary. the toast and jam were fine; standard orange juice; several standard cereals including one granola - you get milk no yoghurt; sausages and bacon were depressing; coffee was even more depressing. despite the breakfast, it was overall a reasonably pleasant place to stay and a good place to base ourselves for sight-seeing.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,'''perfect place for a short stay. the position is perfect to reach the most important places and heathrow in few minutes. the rooms are nice and confortable but small. the cleanliness could be better but absolutely acceptable. not so easy to pick heavy luggages due to the stairways. the breakfast could be better. the personnel at the reception is always available for any kind of info. i would came there again!''',1
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''was looking forward to my stay here but was sorely disappointed. | first i arrived early and when i inquired about possible early check in - i was told it was full and i should have reserved for the prior night. my fault, had i thought about it more it is a small boutique so less likely to have an opening, but i did not think the response was very service oriented. i was shown to a downstairs bathroom to wash up and the sink faucet did not work. another service nit, when i checked in, i was asked which paper i would like and given an option. the next day, no paper and i learn that the person who checked me in failed to point out that the paper i chose was not available on the weekend. a little nit, but coupled with the response to my request for early check in, i would have thought a room at around $1000 a night would include better service. | when choosing hotels i did inquire at the nearby berkeley hotel about possible early check in and they said if it was not available i would be able to use their fitness center facilities. i chose the wellesley instead because i have seen rooms at the berkeley when friends have stayed there and i thought i would be in a larger room at the wellesley. wrong. i have also stayed at claridge's and the four seasons in the past and wanted to try a boutique. | i reserved a junior suite. i understand hotel rooms in the uk and europe are often smaller than in the us, but this ""suite"" was a room with a king bed, two chairs and a very small end table. the bathroom was large, would rather have had more space in the bedroom area. | i wanted to be in knightsbridge/belgravia/chelsea so the location is good. i did not make use of the valet or rolls royce, so cannot comment on that. i would compliment the doorman, he was very nice and helpful with suggestions and information.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''booked the savoy (4 nights) for a wife birthday. presented my fairmont visa chase card at check-in it was declined. how can a fairmont hotel decline a fairmont card. i told chase we were traveling from the us to london. more than that, the desk clerks did nothing to help me resolve the issue. helping with a phone call to the us, would have been a good approach. our travel agent asked for a birthday amenity. request ignored until i returned later in the evening. stopping by the famous american bar before dinner - we were denied entry. hotel guests should have immediate access, and non-residents should wait their turn. fairmont president's club offers room upgrades when available. none was offered. upgrades were available to other guests on that day. overall, we felt like a commoner in a hotel with upper class prices.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,'''the ridgemount is in a good location and seemed to be | reasonable priced .but checked into a twin room and really | was shocked at size and noise from road there was no indication on hotels website that the | twin room given was so small for two adults and the beds were | very narrow i really think the hotel mangement should state its | a very small twin and be prepared for road noise to prepare you for the shock i think if | the breakfast and overall clean condition of hotel was not as good rating would be poor''',1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the place has a great location - right between paddington and lancaster gate stations. the staff are extremely helpful! i was disappointed with the breakfasts (do not drink the coffee!). some newer and better quality bedding, mattresses and pillows, along with a more inspiring and fresher breakfast, and this place would be a great little hotel!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''my wife and i visit london two to three times a year and are constantly trying new hotels and areas to stay. we are yet to find our ideal place or hotel, but the rembrandt is not it. the room was small and the facilities were average and in need of refurbishment. service at breakfast was patchy, requests often forgotten or just ignored, although the food itself was very good. the reception staff were better, but could have been a bit more cheery. location wise the hotel is ideal for the western part of town, the museums etc. overall an average hotel not charging average prices, we will not return.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i paid for my sisters to stay at this hotel so i went to the hotel with them when they arrived. the service staff was courteous and the room was clean with typical features. the price was average for a local hotel in the area without a lot of conveniences. the room assigned was actually around the corner in another building on the third floor. this building did not have an elevator/lift so walking up/down three floors with bags was not fun. breakfast was served in the main hotel. i am glad the length of stay was only 2 nights. again, the staff was very nice but we were surprised that the room was around the block in another building. the breakfast room was bit crowded.'''",1
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''arrived on saturday as a treat from our son and was warmly welcome, lovely hotel, attention to detail superb, it felt like agatha christie could be in the room next door. | unfortunately the staff are quite inexperienced, we had the alarm go on for about 20 minutes in the morning and we did not get our newspaper we ordered but i am sure with time this will improve. | it was also ashame the jazz band were still not playing. | one big draw back was the smoking! | if you are a non-smoker the places to sit and relax with a drink is limited, both terraces and the cigar room are for smoking, the bar has only four stools to sit at and is still strong with the smell of cigars so there is only the jazz room and the restaurant left, if you do not like jazz or are not eating you are a bit stuck, obviously if you are a smoker it is the perfect place for you!'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''london is very expensive, and with the weak american dollar, it is very difficult to get a reasonably priced hotel in the heart of london instead of some outskirt area. | the location of the hotel is fine as it is very close to paddington. it is a 2 minute walk if you use the closest exit to the hotel and do not get lost in the process (which we figured out on the second day). otherwise it is like a 5 minute walk at most. the hotel is mainly on a residential area, and is one of the many connecting townhouses on the same block. | use the heathrow connect instead of heathrow express to get to the hotel from heathrow - it is only 15 minutes difference at 1/2 the price. | the room we got was a triple, and it is kind of strange. it is small, as we expected, and decorated in some dark walls and curtains. the dimension of the room is what is kind of unsettling about it. it is long and narrow, with a 20 feet (iit seems) ceiling. i do not know about others but it just felt kind of oppressive to me. | there is also a crack on the ceiling which we found out the reason why it existed the next night. turned out our room is below another bathroom, and on our second night the guest above overrun the tub, and all the excess water dripped down the ceiling to our room. the dripping continued all night. | the owners were apologic, but it is not a fun experience. the owners were very friendly and helpful in giving directions and even carried our suitcases to/from our room. | otherwise the room is adequate and clean. | breakfast was ok. probably the most sparse out of all the stays in our trip. for 3 pounds more though you can get the english breakfast, which consists of fried eggs, sausage, ham and beans. i think that is the best value at london when a single piece of fish (no chips) is 7 pounds (about $14 when we went).'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i stayed at the dorchester one evening with a friend, and can say it did not live up to expectations. its one of those hotels you dream about staying so we took the plunge. our room was beautifully decorated and our bathroom was amazing, large and wonderful tub, however we had to call down to reception for an iron, and basic items such as water etc. we ordered room service and it took 90 mins for it to arrive and when it did it was the wrong items, when we called down the operator said our food would be 45 mins, but lo and behold within 10 mins the correct food had arrived albeit lukewarm. the beauty and aesthetics of this hotel are unmatched but i think it needs to improve on consistency and service.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''after staying in a few other boutique hotels around, guess there were some expectations built. was disappointed that there was too much emphasis on the glamour and glitz and lacks the colonial charm that usually accompany a boutique hotel converted from an old building. perhaps that was the intentional design? nonetheless, while the quality of the rooms is of high standards, cannot help but wonder if it would have worked better if the king sized bed is more balanced with the size of the room? the room is really small, and furniture size disproportionate. the kettle and tea/coffee were hidden inside the wardrobe! i have only a cabin size luggage and yet there was hardly any room nor any rack for this. the only thing i really like is the location, which is about 6 mins walk away from the tube station, and main road, making it easier to find food and its next to sainsbury.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''the savoy is a beautiful, classic property on the strand, with its backside overlooking the thames. my room was somewhat cramped, but nicely adorned. service was very good. the hotel's location is a strong feature, close to covent garden and many theatres.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we chose the savoy because of its location next to the savoy theatre. the savoy has never been our first choice; we prefer the dorchester or the ritz, so it has been a while since we have stayed. | i just felt that it had become more of a corporate hotel in a vast american chain, which is of course what it is. | bedrooms are smart but lack the luxourious furnishings of the best hotels. air conditioning works very well and is much better than most. | we felt let down by the bars, the cocktail bar having more style in its photos of times past than in the actuality. service was particularly poor and without finesse. breakfast in the room was frugal, and whilst better in the restaurant, service was excruciatingly slow. | we would not stay again, not because it is dreadful, but because it is just not quite good enough, especially for the price'''",1
The Savoy,"'''this is a tricky one to critique as it really goes against the tide of all the phenomenally positive feedback listed by other guests. | i am still wondering whether i expected too much and therefore my experience would have surpassed others expectations. the jury's still out. | so let me begin: | - the ""amazing"" welcome that i read so much about from other guests on tripadvisor did not happen for me. we were rushed through my car drop-off, the gentleman on the door did not welcome us and no time was accommodated for my mother to take in the sheer grandeur and beauty of the frontage of this hotel. | - the lady who greeted us inside gave us no tour, only pointed directions to the savoy grill, the american bar and the thames foyer. i still do not know how i would have gotten to the pool and we had no clue where the museum or shops were located. she was very pleasant, but did not make us feel special at all - such a stark change from a lot of the other feedback left here. | - once inside the room we ordered afternoon tea. it arrived with the wrong tea. this was rectified quickly enough. | - to get ready for the opera i needed to curl my hair. there was no plug for a hairdryer and mirror near each other, so i had to move the desk about 1m in order for me to sit in front of the mirror. | - no closed top bins or sanitary bags in the bathroom which for ladies (such as myself at the time) is unsavoury. | - we had a reservation at kaspar's. we needed to ask three separate members of staff how to find the place. it would have been helpful if the first staff member had simply walked us to the restaurant (they will even do that for you in waitrose if you cannot find something!!!). | - kaspar's was just ok. my mother thought the dover sole was delicious. i thought the lamb was good. the vegetables were plentiful. the desserts were a real let down though. my mother returned the gooseberry trifle after only two mouthfuls and the rice pudding was bland. the size of the dessert spoons were too big - mum even complained that she felt as if she would been given a shovel to eat with. the service was ok, but it almost felt as though they were on auto pilot as twice they filled mum's glass with water despite her clearly telling them on both occasions she did not want any - they poured anyway. | - the room was fastidiously clean apart from the shower screen hinges. you may ask why i bothered to notice this. this is because i fell very ill that evening with sickness and diarrhoea and spent a lot of time in this room! the bathroom should be equipped with more than one toilet roll. it was embarrassing having to call housekeeping at 2am asking for more toilet paper. i am grateful for the savoy's concern about my food poisoning and appreciated their quick response. they clearly took it very seriously and were able to provide a welcome response confirming their 5 star rating hygiene in food preparation etc. | - due to my horrific evening we left as soon as i felt strong enough to vacate the room and drive home. during the transit of my bags they lost my mum's special note from me which was attached to the beautiful flowers i arranged for her. she was very upset about losing that momento. | - mum called the savoy that evening to ask if the cleaner had found her tosca programme in the room, as once again this was a once in a lifetime experience for her and she was upset to have left it behind. the gentleman she spoke to said he would investigate and call her back within 2 hours. almost a week later she is received no call. | all in all the second half of my stay was clearly marred by how poorly i felt. however, the first half just belied the same ""treated like royalty"" experience of many of the other reviewers here. i was left deducing this was down to the fact i had booked under their special saver offer. i could not help thinking if i had booked a suite then perhaps my experience would have been different. | overall our one night stay was all about my mum. i had advised the savoy at the time of booking that she had had an extremely difficult year and deserved pampering. i felt i let her down as our experience just did not live up to my expectations. as i said before though perhaps that is my fault. perhaps i just expected too much.'''",1
A To Z Hotel,"'''i was a bit scared because of some of the reviews, but it was ok! especially tot this price. you should not expect staff that is there for a nice chat, but the room was ok. it was clean, breakfast was ok and the location was ok.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i have stayed at the ridgemount many times. by london standards it is pretty good. in saying that, my single room is tiny and despite it being december and near zero degrees outside, the radiator in my room is cold! price has also gone up from 42 to 48 in the space of about 2 years which seems excessive. | breakfast is very basic and the bread is white. brown bread was not offered to me and i would have liked scrambled eggs rather than the fried egg. the coffee by european standards is awful but for london standards it was satisfactory. with so many tourist passing through the hotel they should have a continental breakfast rather than an english breakfast. non brits are usually horrified to be offered bacon, sausages and synthetic baked beans for breakfast! some croissants with some nice quality jam would be much better or some cold ham or meat which many people like very much for breakfast. | the first thing i did when i left the hotel, was find a cafe serving real coffee. | vibrations from passing traffic was an issue as gower street is very busy. | the walls in the rooms are thin. i could hear the people in the room next door chatting so i had to put in my ear plugs to sleep. | the room was very clean as always and the free wifi works well. | overall, a pleasant enough hotel experience, however, with the elevated price, cold room and unhealthy breakfast, i may look elsewhere for a better hotel next time. | looking at the hotel guestbook that sits in the lobby there are some very easily pleased people out there who are too kind with their comments. this is not a bad hotel do not get me wrong; here are just a number of oversights and a lack of awareness of what people expect for 48-60 a night.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i often stay at this hotel when in london. the rooms are consistently of good size and very nicely appointed. upgrades to rooms overlooking harvey nichols are common. i was disappointed by three things on my last stay: 1) obtrusive security; 2) inconsiderate guests; and 3) terrible food both in room service and the more casual restaurant. | i suspect the first two issues are related; some of the guests appear to be both very rich and very unrefined, a combination which has become a lot more commonplace in london over the past few years. the security lacked discretion and made me a bit nervous as to why so much was needed. a very elegant friend, who was staying at the nearby berkeley, was personally escorted to my room by security. with respect to the guests, i was awoken at all hours on saturday night by loudly slamming doors. it was rather unbelievable. at the least, the hotel needs to buffer the doors, since they cannot control the behavior of rude guests. the food was a disaster for a hotel of this caliber. i ordered a chicken breast dish and it came as a very strange amalgamation of thigh meat. next, i ordered a thin crust pizza, which should have never made it out of the kitchen since it was deep dish i.e. full of bread. i also thought the spa was underwhelming. hotel guest can use between 7 and 9 am or pay 25 pounds at other times. its very small and the relaxation room had only two magazines. i was very glad i did not book a treatment. | i suspect the issue i had are symptomatic of london, a city buzzing with too much new foreign money. its not clear the experience would have been that much different at another five-star hotel, but i am willing to test that theory on my next trip.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''we stayed here after a concert at the olympic stadium. you can walk, takes about 30mins, but there are frequent buses to and from stratford stopping nearby. shops are near if you forget anything and wetherspoons is around the corner. | the hotel was clean and quiet even though it is on a main road, you do not notice. the room is basic but that is all you need for 1 night. tea and coffee in room. the bathroom was not great, shower needed a good clean, other than that room was fine. | breakfast was not too good, the staff could not keep up with people arriving so you had to wait for things. it was busy and not enough space during breakfast. | would stay again.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''it is hard to find a good hotel in london because they are either very expensive or tend to do things hotels would not get away with in other cities. for example, the ""free"" breakfast is only partially free. you can have a few basic things for free, including what seems to be white bread shaped into a croissant, but if you want an actual breakfast you have to pay extra. i found this so ridiculous, especially considering the free food is so inadequate, that i ate elsewhere. | one up side is that the hotel is well located and you can easily walk to the paddington or lancaster gate subway stations. our room was also overall fine in terms of size (considering it is london) and cleanliness. | one down side is that the room was very noisy and it was pretty much impossible to sleep in. we were put in the basement (despite requesting otherwise, but i guess there are only so many rooms for 3 people) and there is very little noise insulation for the room. this was especially problematic during breakfast when we would hear talking and the sounds of utensils on dishes, screaming children...'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the location was perfect and the service was good as you would expect from the mandarin- i would say the room was a bit old looking, you could tell from the walls the door and the windows. however loved the bathroom was spacious and all. overall would recommend the stay for the location!'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''we have reserved online and requested a bouquet of seasonal flowers on arrival (one of their standard suggested experience enhancers) and a chauffeured car to pick us up from the airport, meeting and greeting included. | after i have communicated by mail all the requested detailed information to enable the car to be there and the meeting and greeting to happen when it should, and got a written confirmation that my arrival time, flight number, terminal, number of people and bags were duly noted, i have got a strange call from a lady introducing herself with a heavy accent as being valentina with the dorchesters reservation department and called to clarify important aspects of my airport pick-up request. i had to call her back as she caught me in a meeting but when i did so she was confusingly and unnecessarily repeating the details i had already given and the hotel confirmed they have received. when i did ask her rather abruptly what does she really want she admitted the call was an error. (???) | arriving at the hotel we were greeted very warmly by ismail suarez, a talented guest service agent, who proudly introduced us to the legendary hotel and graciously led us personally to our (upgraded!) room but, to everyone is surprise, the housekeeping were still there, hard at work. ismail had to apologize and offered drinks in the bar. correct one would say, but unnecessary and embarrassing if better communication would of have been employed between the front desk and the housekeeping department. | when we have finally gained access to the room we have noticed the absence of the flowers we have ordered but did not really mind that much the fact until we finally found them! but not in the room as you would expect but as a charge on the bill. not delivering on a request may be a forgivable mistake. charging for a service you did not deliver although requested is a bit more disturbing, do not you think? when we confronted the cashier with this he immediately apologized and graciously offered to comp the internet charges. correct again but again embarrassing and unnecessary. | the breakfast they pride themselves as being one of the best in the city is not as legendary as they wish to think. although the promenade setting is truly fantastic, the food and the service are not memorable. the components of the pastry basket are stale and poor quality and the service is inconsistent. sometimes they go around with the juice carafes offering a choice of orange or grapefruit, sometimes they simply do not. sometimes the toast comes naturally with ones choice of eggs, sometimes one has to ask for it and wait until the eggs get cold. butter is sometimes brought to the table as a standard setting and sometimes it has to be requested for as an extra. there is no choice of poultry cold cuts whatsoever, the very elegant silver salt mills lack salt. | other than that, the rooms are well attended to by the housekeeping staff, classy and well appointed in true country-house style featuring good quality antique furniture but state-of-the-art entertainment, the bathrooms well supplied with good quality amenities, the hotel lobby and hallways are clean and well decorated in classic good taste style. a true gem perfectly located in the city. | the bell and door staff are extremely helpful and genuinely interested in solving whatever problem one may have. a knowledgeable and well connected concierge desk that gets you in almost anywhere and give valuable advice. the chauffeurs are elegant, helpful and very nice. the front desk staff is very helpfull and is doing their best to be efficient. absolutely all the hotel employees smile genuinely and greet the guests at all times throughout the property making one feel welcome and cared for.'''",1
The Savoy,'''my partner and myself checked into our usual fabulous savoy for our special celebration but this time it felt very different. whilst the door staff and concierge remain to keep such high standards and welcoming . we we saddned to be told our favourite art deco style rooms had all been taken even though i had telephone and asked whether this could be possible and said it would be prior to our stay we were very sadly mistaken . not one to make a fuss we said it was fine and was offered a complimentary drink but staying for 4 days and paying the price we did it was a little dissapointing start. staff seemed this time a little preoccupied with having fun with each other rather than the finest waitering service in london i remembered it being. one night we invited a very important client to have dinner with us at kaspars our reservation was at 8.15. service was terrible we sat waiting before even offered a drink and we did not get our mains till 10.20 they quite clearly had forgotten us they did apoogise and offered us the wine on the house. but by that time of night you have gone past eating a big meal and just well the evening was embarrasing... when checking out on our bill by mistake there was 2 breakfasts which was charges to us which we never once had breakfast in the hotel and also things from the mini bar which we never get anything from the mini bar. we got the impression the receptionist did not believe us went off for 10 minuets to investigate.. came back took them off the bill with no apology. you know some of us work really hard for special treats like this. but this time it felt like any normal hotel with an expensive price tag including mishaps and no care in the world. ? |''',1
The Savoy,"'''we were never regulars at the ""old"" savoy. i have now been twice since it reopened and it is all rather sad. i cannot comment on the rooms - we only had diiner and afternoon tea, which in both cases other people paid for as a treat. well, no it was not. the tea used to be among the best in london, now it is not in the top ten. soggy bread, boring cakes, water never quite hot enough plus we were able to watch cleaners dusting as we ate. the room itself just looks less exiting - a bit more plastic than before. my wife hated the carpets. i do not have strong feelings on carpets. the american bar just looked wrong; too much gold leaf or something and while i am sure they must have reserved areas before i cannot remember them being surrounded by ropes. the reception area which used to be so buzzy now feels flat and boring' full of corporate types waiting to show you to your room. dinner in the grill was ok but had something a little lacking that even now i cannot put my finger on. | these great old city centre hotels were all build by people with big egos (including the savoy). you have to handle them with care and i think that is the big problem with the savoy. it used to be a ""destination hotel"" not only for its look and location but also for that unique bit of style that staff who cared about an institution (and in many cases have grown old with it) gave the old place. it is now had it is rough edges knocked off, we have far more substance but less style. i am sure the wifi is better, the lifts quicker and the aircon better - but with respect any hotel can give you that. the savoy gave you something else - a feeling that service still existed in a world where the word is used a lot but the actuality of being served by an individual who takes pride in that service is few and far between. and that is a shame. | afternoon tea? go to browns or the ritz. in fact if you want to see how to restore a grand hotel go to the ritz or the dorchester. what do they both have in common? owned by people with (dare i say) egos the same size as the original owners, who would run a mile from any form of corporate identity for their hotel. however if funds do not stretch that far do try the lagham in portland place. a lot of the ex savoy staff went there after it closed and i think quite a few stayed!'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''bed was so lumpy on one side to the point of not usable. the desk chair piston would sink after a couple of minutes requiring constant adjustment. the reception desk clerk was cold and uncaring. location was great walking distance to office and food.''',1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we stayed at this hotel for four nights and we had a room on the ground floor just next to the reception which meant it was very noisy, when other guests came home late at night and rang the doorbell. | room was clean and had strong wifi. staff was very helpful regarding logistics when planing the day. | would stay there again but would ask for a room facing the gardens and not on the ground floor.'''",1
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''fantastic facility very poorly operated. this hotel completely lacks seriousness in reservations. i reserved a suite and upon arriving was notified that my room was given mistakenly to someone else, i was accommodated in the only room left in the hotel which unfortunately had no a/c and upon complaining was moved to another at 11pm that had a/c but the blower rattled so at 11:30 pm had to return to the original with no a/c to sleep before a transatlantic flight. certainly not what you expect for $1,200 dollars. when i arrived home and received my credit card statement i was amazed to see that they duplicated my invoice and along the way they added some room service and laundry service charges that did not belong to add insult to injury.'''",1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''stayed for 5 nights with my wife, the hotel is nice and clean, room was big enough for us(although not much room for luggage), and staff were friendly, but a few small issues knocked the rating down. firstly the shower was terrible, it just seemed to dribble water, you could use a handheld showerhead which was powerful but really you should not have to. secondly the housekeeping did not seem well organised, on 2 days we left the hotel at 8 and returned after 4 to find the room had not been cleaned and then the staff turned up to see if they could clean it, and on another day the housekeeper entered the room without knocking. the wifi was also too slow to be of much use and the tablet, whilst a good idea, did crash on us a few times. it was also quite loud in the hotel and whilst we could hardly hear the traffic outside we could clearly hear people's conversations in the room above us, and people moving about on our floor and the floor above. overall though the hotel is nice, and kept very clean, with helpful and friendly staff in a good location and if these issues were resolved we would happily go back and stay again.'''",1
The Savoy,'''this has been a hotel that i have always wanted to visit and had such high expectations. the hotel really does take your breath away when you walk in and there are plenty of staff to help you. we had booked for three nights. | we were told by our 'check in' staff member that he was sorry he was taking a while as he was doing something nice for us and was ensuring it was possible. both my partner and i wondered what this was....turns out nothing!!! | when i used coffee machine...we discovered a crack in it too late as the water had already leaked and caused the room electrics to trip! | our first night was dreadful as our room was at the end of an alley where all through the nights the hotel's bins and deliveries were sorted! nightmare! | we complained the next morning and were told we would be moved by 2pm. we explained this would be brilliant as we had a show booked. | by 5.30 we could finally get in our new room...with now a mad rush to get ready and catch our show! | our new room was beautiful and the noise was gone and we did enjoy the rest of our stay. | the famous cocktails were ridiculous in their pricing...you do expect to pay for the name but 20 to 50 for a few sips ?? should have just drank a bottle of cough medicine for a couple of pounds and would have tasted better! | overall i felt the hotel lacking and its reputation out doing its reality. we shall be sticking to the me across the road.''',1
The Savoy,"'''we stayed here for 1 night in a suite at a cost of 500. i tried really hard to appreciate the history, attention to detail, surroundings and general ambiance of the savoy, but i left underwhelmed. the hotel is 'ok', the staff are nice and pleasant and the food is lovely, but i could not help but think that if this is 5 star luxury, i am missing something. the room did not strike me as being luxurious and left me thinking 'is this it?'. although the location is great, for the price we paid i would of rather paid half and got a taxi in to the centre . we stayed in room number 500 which for a suite was small, it had an great view of a roof and adjoining rooms, which was disappointing. the mini bar is a joke, it is extortionate, even for london prices,for a room that price i would of expected at least a few drinks included. i dare say we have stayed in hotels just as good, for a lot less of the price, and for a hotel that states it is one of the best in london, it is a shame. there is nothing wrong with the overall cleanliness, staff or our stay, i just feel that if your after a 5* stay in london, you maybe underwhelmed . i tried really hard to digest the savoy and all it sets out to be, but i left with a sour taste in my mouth, although that could of been from the drastically overpriced cocktails.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we enjoy staying in the elegant, timelessly classic hotels in london, especially in mayfair. however i was intrigued to see this highly rated corinthia. we went to have tea in order to see the hotel and get a feel for the style. | the building itself is beautiful. great architecture: a very well-preserved building. i love the street on which it is located because it is far enough from trafalgar square that you still feel as if your in a tranquil area. (in fact, when we were thinking of staying here i was annoyed they referred to a particular suite as a ""trafalgar suite"" and then admitted it was impossible to see the square unless you landed a suite on the top floor.) | i was heartily underwhelmed by the entrance/lobby/public space which other reviewers refer to as having a ""wow factor"". well i suppose if glitzy and gaudy are the definition of whatever this ""wow factor"" is, then it is the right phrase of course we are all entitled to our opinions but garish lighting and tons of marble do not translate into the type of elegance one would hope to find behind that lovely facade. | the main tea area, where we sat, was generic and forgettable. between the glitziness and unimaginative decor i felt as if i was in a very grand commercial hotel that caters to groups. however, i felt i should give it a chance: it was raining and the doormen gave us a pleasant welcome. | i was really let down by the slow and disconnected service in the tea lounge. the women in charge were lackadaisical. it took forever for them to sort out where we would sit. my son ordered a special hot chocolate drink that was supposed to come with marshmallows and whipped cream and some other treats. these treats were missing entirely. the server set down a cup and pot and disappeared. the chocolate was actually barely warm. it took quite some time before i could get the attention of the staff. the person who came over found it impossible to understand that we needed some hot milk to add to the chocolate. as well, she could not grasp that all the special extras for the chocolate were missing. i must say for a top hotel i find it exceptionally surprising that no seasoned expert manager is minding the space! all the wait staff were just hanging around the service station and paying no attention to the guests. i really found it hard to believe a humongous las vegas-style chandelier is more important for attracting customers than for fine service. it is said the standards one expects at such an hotel are non-existent. sloppy. i was finished with my excellent cappuccino before they sorted out my son's hot chocolate. i recall having something to eat, but honestly, the surprisingly bad service is all i can remember. i know many people enjoy the glossy, hard product such as the gadgets, the fancy chandelier and lots of electronic gadgets (in the rooms). but i am sold through great service. there really is no excuse for careless and inattentive service at a top rated hotel when all that is required is a hot drink to be served as described on its menu and as ordered. very disappointing.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''stayed here for a half term break, some good and bad points | its location is excellent, a tube station and tottenham court road are nearby. good streets for restaurants and pubs. easy walking distances to oxford street and covent garden. it is cheap for london, two people bed and breakfast for a 75 - a bargain. | room was really small, i know its london but our double room was tiny and difficult to move about in. it became incredibly hot after showering. the dcor in our room needed updating. the bathroom was nice, with a good shower but the extractor fan made a constant noise which was annoying. | breakfasts could not fault the service, very fast and efficient. however the choice was random and limited to three cooked items which changed daily. tea and coffee was not nice. | lounge great to have free internet access. it is really easy to use and no waiting. the furniture here was tired and needed replacing. | overall, if you looking for a cheap place to stay in london with no frills then this is the place for you. i cannot fault the price or location but found the furniture and dcor old fashioned.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we stayed overnight for a friend's wedding. the common parts were lovely. the staff we felt were overly obsequious, offering us a chair when all we wanted were directions to a room. the room itself was a total letdown. beige hell. sort of art deco with pieces of cheap furniture thrown in. the hot water dribbled out making a shower almost impossible. the hot tap in the sink turned the wrong way, not a big deal but very odd. however the bed itself was really comfortable. in all we were disappointed with the experience. stayed in many better hotels for far less money. i am sure this is on of very few negative reviews but that is how we felt.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''great location for the river thames walk and the theatre night out, close to coventry garden which is a bonus. there are full of tourists all the time there. but they lost their characteristics after the refurbishment. they used to have the uniqueness. missed the bar but no anymore. no atmosphere...prefer browns hotel as they have their own style and near the bond street where you can find interesting people, not only tourists. if i paid the amount of room charge again? no, i do not think so.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we often stay in posh london hotels to have a weekend chill out in our home city and we eagerly awaited the opening of the mondrian. the hotel itself is beautiful and set on the river in a fabulous location on the south bank to easily access tate modern, the globe, tower bridge (go see the poppies in the moat of the tower, really impressive) and the south bank arts complex. it is a well designed space with great funky rooms, huge marble bathrooms, and a young hip vibe missing from so many london hotels. breakfast by the thames was lovely, the gym is great all brand new and check in friendly and helpful. so far so good. | so why such a mediocre experience? just little annoying glitches, but they combined to make it a disappointing stay overall. | i read the info pack in our room. a curzon cinema on site? fabulous. the rooftop bar now open? count us in. we rang guest services as directed. is the cinema showing films this weekend? 'er, i do not think so.......' ok scratch that. can we book a table in the rooftop bar? 'er i can request one, but the bar manager will have to email you to confirm whether or not they can accommodate you and they do not start until 5pm'. but i do not have access to email - can you call me, text me, leave a message on my room phone, with reception, or a note pushed under our door? no. if the rooftop bar is full, can we book dandelyan instead? that is also done by separate email only too. odd. so i spent an annoying ten minutes syncing my home email account onto my smartphone (god help you if you have an old mobile, or no mobile/tablet, or international roaming charges..) only to find two immediate reservations were confirmed for both bars at once. all before the manager had apparently arrived. i was baffled but hoping the rooftop bar reservation was correct and we turned up that night to the 12th floor. the bar had no sign, just a frosted door marked fire escape. we could not see anything on that floor that looked like a bar, so we headed in anyway, half expecting a fire alarm to trip! it was the bar! this lack of signage seemed to be a theme - i could not see anything anywhere externally saying this is the mondrian hotel. we know upper ground but even then only found it as a doorman stood outside and we asked him - again god help anyone not native to this city, or indeed anyone local without a good knowledge of the back streets of bankside! | so the bar... wonderful cocktails, amazing views, but the music quickly got louder and louder to the point where you could not have a conversation and the waiter could not hear your order. we have done rooftop bars all over the world and they generally have chill out music and a relaxed vibe. this seemed more like a nightclub but one with middle aged couples desperately craning into one another to try and hear somebody! we headed onto the outdoor terrace with our waiter's recommendation - again wonderful. i grabbed my jacket from the room and we settled in to admire the view. but no - within five minutes we were told the outdoor terrace closes at 10pm. so why seat us outside at 9.45?! needless to say, we would lost our first indoor table by then so hurridly finished up in the noisy bar and headed to our room at 10.15. not the night in the bar we had expected! | oddly for a five star hotel, we received no turn down service and no mineral water for the night. there were no robes or slippers in the room which was a shame. i would recommend a river view room though most face, like us, the wrong way so we looked out over a huge building site. this was fair enough though, we chose a cheap rate, and the hotel is fairly priced for central london, but i think the experience is better on the river. | we booked a weekend deal with a wonderful breakfast and late check out at 3pm on sunday. fabulous. we kept our 'do not disturb' on our door throughout sunday yet despite this were disturbed by what looked like maintenance men in the morning asking to come in. we asked why but they had little english so conversed amongst themselves and knocked again. we said again why? i had just left the shower so did not really fancy sharing the room in my wet towel (no robe remember...) unless it was an emergency. the two men left. odd. we had a quick gym session and returned to our room at 2.30 to begin packing up for check out. oddly, and again despite the 'do not disturb' notice, a workman had let himself in and plastered a small patch of wall by the bed (we would never noticed it even needed repair), showering our stuff in a film of dust. really they could not wait until we would checked out?? again a bit twilight zone to be honest. | so finally we went to check out and facing a long queue and the threat of missing our train home, we just handed in the keys to a staff member who said they would check us out, and we left. i have done this many times before without a problem, but given our experiences in the mondrian, i felt unsettled so rang the hotel when we got home to check the bill was ok. no of course it was not - they would added on a charge for breakfast even though she could see it was included in our rate. groan. it is apparently being sorted and i really hope it is. i just feel so frustrated by this place - everything could be perfect with just a few common sense touches from the staff, oh and a couple of signs. maybe we got it on a bad day and were just unlucky? what a shame, it had such potential.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this hotel is overrated by previous opinions. hotels in london are expensive, and ""budget"" options are frequently 3-4 story old houses that have been updated as hotels. this means small bathrooms and thin walls. | the location of the ridgemount is excellent, five blocks from the british museum. | the room was small with two beds for the kids and a bigger bed for the adults, but smaller than a queen bed. the matress was irregular and the pillows were awful. the bathroom was small but ok. we were not able to turn off the heating, so at night it was really hot. there was no air conditioning so be aware for the summer. | breakfast was spectacular. you had various cereal options, toasts, butter, and jam. on top of that there was a hot dish with eggs, bacon or ham, and beans. excellent. | wifi available for free. | not sure i would choose this hotel again.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed for 4 nights with friends after some recommendations. we upgraded the standard room to have an extra bed which was initially good. later on it was uncomfortable especially when you came to know that is its a sofa. | the room was roomy and clean but later we discovered that there are 2 parts, old and new one which my room filled in the old part of the hotel. i took a look on one of the new rooms which was woow!!. | the location is excellent as well as the services. unfortunately i need to comment about a rude representative faced me in my last night. even that before booking i called the hotel and they confirmed that guest is welcome; he rudely stopped me and request my guest to leave!!! after a small conversation he order that he need my guest to leave before his shift end which was embarrassed and unacceptable at all. | i faced another bad service when my shower was not working and i waited for more than an hour for the maintenance to come and check and after more than 6 phone calls. | overall i think its a good hotel. the only reason of thinking to visit it again is the location and nothing more.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''at first sight the rembrandt hotel seems fairly beniegn, and there will be no surprises there,the rooms are pretty much like the lobby, breakfast is ordinary and the word quaint would not enter the picture, the surprise is in the location. south kensington tube station is two blocks away and surrounding the station are a series of small quaint stores, cafes, pub, deli, bakery...... and if you venture down brompton st you will happen on a small village with more shops, restaurants etc. the victoria and albert museum is just across the street along with an on &amp; off bus stop. hyde park is a short walk away as is harrords and harvey nichols. so if you are looking to save your money on accommodation and spend it on shopping, eating and entertainment, this is the place.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''we have been visiting the dorchester for years, but something is happening and it is not good. the staff on the reception and concierge/doormen are good, but what is going on with the waiting staff? either in the grill (which although prettier since refurbishment has been disappointing food wise), the cocktail area at the end of the promenade has strange service, sometimes prompt and good, others slow with a lack of interest/effort. we, one time, waited 20 minutes for our cocktails, when we were the only ones waiting for dinks and were sitting at the bar! our bartender seemed intent on looking out for anyone else's needs, such as spilt drinks further round the bar, talking to other bar staff (or arguing with them) and indeed wandering around!? at breakfast, the food appeared only luke warm. staying a couple of times a year and booking a couple of rooms each time you would think at christmas when it came to have some ""sweeties"" from the cute christmas shop we could scoot in and get a bag without the feeling of being under intense scrutiny from staff. a couple of large bags of sweets seemed to really concern them with us facing hard stares!! however paying several thousand pounds for our short visit i felt they could afford 2 bags of sweets!, and we could have done without the disgruntled staff - are the sweets just for show? odd things like this were not good, generally, just did not feel like a flagship london hotel should. we always love our rooms and how they join together but that was the best we could say of this visit which i think, sadly, will be our last. after filling in the client questionnaire on my return home and explaining our disappointments i did not hear a word from the hotel and can only assume they are happy to lose customers which they have in this case. we are now looking at the savoy for our next trip.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''this is a small boutique hotel. traveling for business, the location was exactly what i needed. i think it is a bit far from the tourist destinations. my room was stylish, but small. i was pleasantly surprised to find a bathroom at the hotel. i did find that the breakfast options were limited. there was no way to simply order breakfast or a cup of coffee to go in the lobby. the food at the hotel was average. the lack of a spa area was disappointing.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''booked this hotel with a group of friends. excellent location and relatively easy to find, although road closures did not help. if you are looking for a base for a good nights sleep, nice breakfast and clean but simple rooms, then this is it. | our room for two, would have slept five, with a double, bunk beds and a single. it was clean and bed surprisingly comfortable. small shower/ toilet but adequate. small fridge in room, but room was very hot and air conditioning seemed to make little difference. | breakfast was included and was plentiful with a very nice man serving. usual cereals, pastries, croissants, ham, cheese, toast and jams. you could eat as much as you liked. | one downside to this hotel is the stairs. there are no lifts, but they were happy to carry our luggage. very useful was the parking permit, which was included and they were happy for us to return to them even after we had checked out. that allowed us to complete another day in london without having to worry about parking. | also lovely deli, fish and chips and pubs, a stones throw away.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i was sent a review to complete after my stay which i completed straight away as i had found a disgusting maggot in my fruit in the room and i was very disappointed. my response was ignored. i was at the hotel this week for an awards ceremony and just asked to sit down for 2 minutes to have a cup of tea as i was waiting for a very important customer - the waiter was rude, quite agressive and i felt awful. he just wanted me out of the way as quickly as possible. i went into the bar area and a cordon was put up in a section which fell on me and eventually i found a seat but hurt my leg in the process not to mention felt embrarassed. needless to say i could not meet my customer there as there was not enough room in the corner. i took my customer elsewhere but it was truly upsetting and i felt like a second class citizen. this is not what i had expected. i hope you do listen to this message!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at the rembrandt on a saturday night in august and we have no plans to go back. by far the best thing about it was the location. it is almost opposite the v&amp;a museum and a short walk (10/15 mins) from harrods and lots of other shops. easy access to other parts of the city by tube and plenty of bars, restuarants and cafes nearby if you do not fancy travelling far. as for the hotel, we found the staff on reception standoffish to the point of unfriendly at times. our room was clean and comfortable but tired and dated. the breakfast was a mediocre buffet affair - my pain au chocolat was good but my husband eggs, straigh from the buffet counter, were almost cold. totally forgettable. i know 150 does not stretch far in london but we did expect a little better than this. we agreed our 50 stay at a premier inn recently - admittedly not in london! - was a much more enjoyable, and better value, experience.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''the corinthia's decor is beautiful. stunning, even. its location is excellent. overall the service (when we could reach anyone -- see below) was very good. but unfortunately we had quite a few issues during our 3-night stay, and as a result we would have to think really hard before giving this property another try in the future. | a little background about us: we visit london multiple times each year. we usually stay at the goring or the milestone, which are both traditional, small 5-star hotels. we normally book through amex fhr or a virtuoso travel agent, and we are repeat guests at both hotels. so we are treated very, very well at those two properties: we always have a nice note from the general manager and a welcome gift waiting for us when we arrive, and we are always assigned excellent -- usually upgraded -- rooms or suites. | this was our first stay at the corinthia, so i was not expecting that level of attention, but i did expect more than what we experienced. i have read some great reviews of the hotel and although we love the treatment we receive at the goring and the milestone, we prefer a more modern decor, which the corinthia has. i also enjoy lavish spas, which those really small hotels cannot offer. having experienced espa at the peninsula nyc, i was eager to try espa at the corinthia as well. | when i happened across a half-price room rate offer on the corinthia's website, i decided to give the hotel a try for a short stay we had coming up in london. perhaps booking that offer was my mistake, because our room assignment (in an executive king, which is the hotel's top room category below suites) was definitely sub-par. i have to assume that was because we were first-time guests and paying a low rate. | our room (117) was on the first floor and very noisy. it is apparently located just above the rubbish bins, as we were awakened every morning around 6:30 by the sound of glass bottles being emptied out of the bins. the noise was really loud the first morning, which made me wonder if the double-glazing was faulty. in examining the window next to our bed, i discovered that housekeeping (or the previous guest, undetected by housekeeping) had left the window open about 3"" from the top. after the window was closed properly, the noise of the bins being emptied was more muffled, but still noticeable. | there was also an intermittent, loud banging in the ceiling that sometimes went on for as long as 10 minutes at a time. this happened twice in the middle of the first night. we thought this was something wrong with the air conditioning unit, so in the morning i called housekeeping and asked if engineering/maintenance could look into the noise. to the hotel's credit, someone arrived within minutes. the banging obediently started right up while he was in the room, and we confirmed that this was the noise we were complaining about, then left for breakfast, assuming he would fix it. | turns out, no. the noise never let up. we finally realized it must be the pipes, as it was much worse every morning starting around the time when people are taking showers. i am fairly astonished that after the developer put about half a billion dollars into the renovations of this building, the pipes are so noisy. | we had a lot of issues when trying to reach staff on the phone: specifically, no one would answer when calling the concierge or the spa. on the first evening after we arrived, i called the spa no less than 5 times in 90 minutes and never got an answer. the line would just ring and ring, and then disconnect. i tried both of the phones in the room. i also tried calling the direct extension of the spa, instead of just pressing the icon for ""spa."" i made sure to try at odd times (not on the hour or half-hour, when they might be busy checking people in and out). finally i gave up, walked down to the spa and made my appointments. there were two women working at the desk and i was the only person in the spa lobby, so it is not like they were busy. | same thing with the concierge desk, which i called 3 times on the first night as i wanted to make a reservation for the hotel restaurant. ten or a dozen rings, then a disconnect. i finally got an answer on the 4th attempt. | reception and housekeeping answered the phones consistently, but the concierge was hopeless throughout our stay. | the final, mild irritant in our room was the round table, apparently intended to serve as both a dining table and a desk. it was so tippy and unstable that we had to hold it in place whenever we needed to use it, lest everything slide off onto the floor. my husband twisted it around a bit so that it was slightly more stable, but it always rocked at the slightest touch. i am not sure if this was a design flaw or if it was broken. | i seriously considered complaining to the general manager of the hotel, but our stay was short and i really did not feel like taking up part of my day with it. any one of these problems (particularly the table/desk one) could be seen as trivial. when you added them all together, though, it made for a less-than-ideal experience. | the spa is stunning, and once i got my appointments set up, my experiences there were excellent. the relaxation pods are particularly fantastic. | we loved the bassoon bar, which has a dazzling decor and delicious drinks (as one would expect at 16 each). | we enjoyed our two breakfasts and one dinner in northall restaurant. the service was excellent and the food very nice. | ultimately i think we like smaller, more personal hotels that get all the details right.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the first impression is what you would expect of a great london hotel, but inside it has become a coach tourist type of place which was disappointing. a new bar sits uncomfortably in the grand old lounge and the restaurant is there to deal with feeding large quantities of people as cheaply and quickly as possible. it did not look good so i ate elsewhere. my room was small and looked at a wall, but that is london. it was clean and had been newly redecorated so the upstairs ranks better than the downstairs. they have a gym and pool in the basement which is a nice touch but it looks tired and in need of a new fit out. | the function rooms are well sorted and have kept the right feel that goes with the building, they are also surprisingly big and well priced.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we were three family members in one room for 4 nights. the room was on 2nd floor without elevator, but the receptionist jumped up and carried our biggest suitcase with a smile. the room was amazingly quiet (to the backyard) and very small, but clean. there are two closets in the room, one for the clothes and one turned out to be the bathroom; but it worked for us. the breakfast room in the basement is a bit cramped. the service is very good, people in the reception are really helpfull and smiling. the internet was fine, according to the 14 year old. the hotel is conveniently located close to paddington station, where there are tube, trains and busses to almost anywhere. you may also walk to oxford street, it takes about 20 minutes and edgware road is multicultural, primarily arabic, and interesting. overall the hotel is fine for the price'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the mandarin hotel is something you would expect the best of the best, now honestly its lost his glamour. | checking in at the hotel was exceptionally professional, quick, kind and helpful. | the room itself is out-dated. the bathroom does not match the glamour from the room. | the bar itself is very crowded and the receptionist girl from the bar/ restaurant was not polite at all. i even felt offended the way she answered me when i asked if there was still a table available! too bad for this kind of hotel. | the hotel is overall perfectly maintained. | staff does somethimes miss their smile and kindness. also i felt as a number in this hotel instead of a person. | i booked a room with breakfast included. during breakfast, i asked for a cappucino. the unexperienced waiter told me this would be extra charged! honestly, i do not like hotels were they charge you for every single extra thing. the view from the breakfast room is fantastic. | overall, the mandarin hydepark is not my cup of tea anymore. i stayed there about 10 years ago, and service was much more focused.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''really!!! had a night in this place and i do not no what anyone else expects but when i go to a hotel in london i would like a person who speaks english on reception, we had difficulties in figuring out what we were being told generally, but really when you go into the hotel bar as a resident and are told you must move in 45 minutes because of people coming in from the street there is something wrong, not to mention when you go to the bar at 5:40 and and pay 5:50 for a bottle of heineken but then at 6:05 the price is up to 6:19, i mean really get you are head out of your pretentious self and join the real world, i will give you the place is lovely to look at, but so are supermodels, that does not mean there is much content there!'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''it is a convenient and reasonably priced option to stay next to paddington station. a short walk from paddington means heathrow is in easy reach. | the hotel is on a nice road, albeit currently with road works. there is a second building a very short walk from the first. | the single room was tiny, but all the essentials were in there, clean and tidy. tiny shower and tiny sink. i could use the bathroom when the door was open. i only spent a few hours to sleep in there, so this was ok. left early in the morning, so did not have breakfast. | very steep steps to get to the top floor. so i would not recommend if traveling with lots of luggage or have difficulties climbing steps.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''first the good points: i wanted a quiet room and was given one on the ground floor near the back which had no street noise and not much noise from other guests. that was good. the location is very convenient - a few minutes from paddington tube/rail in one direction and a few minutes from lancaster gate tube in the other. reasonable price. | but, the promised wifi was not working two of the three mornings i was there. this was a significant inconvenience, especially as this was one reason for choosing the hotel. the second time, when i reported it before breakfast, it was still not working afterwards. i discovered late on the second night that the tv was not working, did not seem to have power although it appeared to be connected. this was only a minor irritation, and was fixed next day after i reported it. when i arrived, there were no sachets of milk for tea. okay, some soon arrived after i reported it. on the second day, when i returned in the evening, there were no sachets of milk, all had been removed! reported again, new supply. | so mixed feelings about this one.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i am really undecided on this one. | i stayed here for one night on a business trip to london as my ""normal"" hotels were very expensive for some reason. | pretty new, clean and very modern and if that is your thing then all well and good but frankly i am a little tired of hotels that use a whole rainbow of colours, trendy (rather than comfortable) furniture and dark spaces (usually where you do not need it to be dark). | i personally prefer neutral and bright but if trendy is your thing then you will be happy here. i would not stay again not because this is a bad hotel but rather at the end of a long working day i want peace and tranquility on the eye as well as one the ear.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the best feature of the rhodes hotel is location. the paddington station, served by the heathrow express train service, is a short walk away. hyde park, numerous restaurants, and several underground stations are nearby. as other reviewers have noted, the room was small, the bathroom was cramped, and storage space was limited. an english breakfast was included with the room. we did not have much luck with the wireless internet service and had to make frequent visits to the lobby to establish a useful wifi connection.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''the hotel looks great, there is a door man and polite staff. however, room was small with stained sheets. nice touches like free bottled water, high end toiletries and a tablet in the room, but let down with cleanliness and lack of other facilities like ironing board. | if you intend to use communal areas, it looks great but to be honest i stayed in a premier inn recently that was more comfortable and cleaner for half the price.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''stayed for one night, which was long enough. one of the chief pleasures of english hotels is the provision of tea. the suite provided a butler,[what is the point of that?] but the provision of a kettle, teapot and tea and coffee involved an extra charge on an already very high bill.. the savoy really has lost the plot, in that no self-respecting english hotel should charge for this very standard provision. | there are acres of marble, gilt fixtures, fresh flowers, chintz winged chairs and chandeliers...all at a somewhat over-inflated price.the hotel has been refurbished to reflect its past glories, but falls down on service, and it is oppressively stuffy and snobbish. it is more like visiting a museum than a hotel. it also has roomfulls of very bad chocolate box art, edwardian ladies holding frilly umbrellas and puppies. | the savoy grill in the savoy hotel is a different entity, and fairmont points are not credited! the savoy grill does not acknowledge that it isa different business...run by gordon ramsey. | so go if you want to have a look at who is running the country...the bankers and politicians, and the ghosts of past glory.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,'''the room was small with a big bed which was not so bad. very comfortable. pretty clean overall. we stayed in the hotels second building which was actually pretty nice. there was no lobby area but it was very quiet. so many stairs to reach out third floor room. the breakfast that was included with our room was not satisfactory. we ate a little to be polite and then had a better meal elsewhere. overall it was pretty good for 100$ a night.''',1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we stayed at mandarin oriental hyde park knightsbridge december 2012. what an incredible location! from our room looking down street to right you could see harrods dept store lit up in all its glory! | the room was large &amp; beautiful with a gorgeous free standing mirrored wardrobe that ran the length of one wall. | but the bed was so incredibly hard it gave us back problems! there were also problems with the service for the room where one day the room was not cleaned despite fact we were gone sightseeing well into evening. | minor complaints really but considering this is quite a high end hotel in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in london, we expected a lot more! | i am sure however if we stayed there again &amp; was sure to specifically mention upon check in of our dislike of hard mattresses they would be able to accommodate us somehow! |'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''great location, but no better than a travel lodge or holiday inn really. expensive room. was told that i would be given a room at the back and up high, but on returning to collect the key i was on the first floor and facing the front. luckily there was another room available. the room was a good size and quiet, the bathroom nice, although, the pump in the bathroom turned itself on at midnight (twice) instructions to turn off were rubbed off the plaque on the wall. - annoying, the tv in the room would not work properly, all channels were pink - annoying. tea and coffee, cheap and stingy. i packet of biscuits for potentially 3/4 people as i was put in a room with a third bed made up. breakfast ok, good selection. staff very good, polite and very helpful. i would not stay again. although the location was good, there was not anything else about the hotel that warranted the cost. at the end of the day i like value for money and i did not feel that the rembrandt offered that at all. it simply relies on where it is. shame, as i like a bit more for my hard earned money.

London Guest House,"'''i booked this online from australia and did not want to pay a fortune. also as i was driving i did not want to pay the congestion charge or attempt to drive right into the city centre. parking was very limited and i think i was probably one of the lucky few who got a spot. the staff could not have been more friendly and it was very clean. broom cupboard is what springs to mind for the bedroom but at the price....... very straightforward 5 - 10 minute walk to the tube station but i realise many people nowadays find that a challenge. breakfast was simple but adequate......if you want a full english breakfast this is not the place for you. acton high street is only 10 minutes walk away so plenty of places to eat and only a 20 minute tube ride into central london. although it is not the best place i have stayed in by any stretch of the imagination i would be more than happy to recommend it for people on a budget, who do not mind very small rooms and a basic brekky.'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''finishing up a multi-night stay at the legendary dorchester... | plusses | - great location | - class and $$ pervade at every corner (a fleet of luxury vehicles surrounds the front entrance) | - attendants at seemingly every turn wishing you a ""cheery"" good day | - room very nicely appointed with high quality furnishings (four phones?) | negatives | - some carpeting and other areas looking a little tired | - work out area highly outdated (small, cramped, no windows, but decent equipment) | - had breakfast, twice. english breakfast way overpriced at 34 pounds. on the second time, literally nothing ordered was brought correctly. couple next to us was to the moon with frustration on timeliness and quality of service. really quite amazing at how bad it was. it is breakfast for goodness sake, and at 34 pounds, at a place like the dorchester, it should be more than right.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''went to the savoy hotel london on the18th january 2014 for dinner. we were early, so we went to the american bar for a drink beforehand. we queued to get in, not for long,,but long enough for me to ask the the girl on the desk to contact kaspers restaurant to tell them that we were in the hotel bar and would be about 15 mins late. we wanted to ensure that they knew we were in the hotel bar so that we did not loose our table .the young lady that served us in the american bar was brilliant, the desk staff not good. we were walking to kaspers when my mobile went to find out if we still needed our table. the desk staff at the american bar had not informed the front of house of kaspers. he was not happy!! | any way the meal and service was very good despite a small problem with my meal which was sorted without any problem. | the biggest problem was trying to get a drink afterwards! we went to the bar by the restaurant | only to be told that we had to queue again for a table, and it was a long queue. they refused to serve us in seats facing the bar, there were loads empty, as we were not staying at the hotel. we explained that we had just left our dinner table at kaspers and just wanted a after dinner drink, it was only 23.30.the front of house at the bar was extremely snotty about it, eating at the kaspers and spending well over 200 carries no weight. if this is the hotel's rule they should make it clear when you are sat at your table. it is a shame because we liked the hotel and have had lunch their many times and we were thinking of staying their next time, but we will not be back again.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the comments on here about chris and maria are spot on. they are lovely people and very helpful. | the rooms vary in quality. i cannot remember the number but there is a room with a pergo (simulated wood) bathroom floor, which is where we spent two nights. this room needs renovation. the beds were uncomfortable and the room generally on the shabby side. on return to london from the continent, we asked for 216 after formerly getting a peek from a nice older couple who were using it. it is a ""superior"" room and costs more but has a new bath with a spa tub and a balcony. i liked this room a lot. in closing, we would consider staying there again, but also note that there are many hotels in the area, many on the quieter squares, which should be investigated as options.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''the hotel is just ok, the breakfast is nice but the room we were was too small . and it smells abit. there was just one small soap for two people. if you are muslim , there are plenty of halal restaurants around there,'''",1
The Savoy,"'''stayed at the savoy on valentines night in a superior room - to say it was a tiny room would be an understatement, it was a case of get out of bed manoeuvre across the wall, walk round the bed hit knees off dressing table then reach the bathroom (very nice bathroom actually) my other half booked the savoy because he was going to propose (he did i said yes) as a special treat but i would have preferred the grosvenor hotel where we have stayed before because of the lovely rooms and the service. at the grosvenor if you want tea and coffee the send you a tea and coffee tray - at the savoy that is classed as room service and charged as such. | the big issue for me was the tiny little hole in the roof called a superior room - god alone knows what a standard room looks like!? | breakfast although expensive was very good'''",1

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i am so disappointed that i am not able to give the corinthia a rave review. i have been waiting to stay there since i first toured the property in may, 2011. i was so thrilled to finally be staying at a luxury property in london. previous stays in the city were at a b&amp;b back when i was in college, the royal national twice 12/13 yrs ago (scary!) &amp; the metropolitan (so not impressed) in 2011. i read &amp; reread the reviews every day &amp; the anticipation was palpitating. | but the reality...it is been a couple of days since i checked out of the corinthia &amp; luckily my back has started to feel better. why did my back hurt? because the mattresses at the corinthia are much too firm. do they have any sort of foam egg crates or thicker mattress pads that could be put on the bed? no. | i simply cannot be the only person who has ever asked for a foam egg crate or complained about the mattress. i believe they promote the mattress as some sort of specialty brand. not a brand i would ever buy. the mattress is not hard like ones you may find in thailand (napasai on koh samui comes to mind), it is just very firm. maybe it is too new? i do not know. considering the bed is an integral part of a hotel stay, i will not be able to stay at the corinthia again unless they begin providing some sort of pad that makes the bed softer. | the other main issue i had with my room was it smelled quite musty. it literally took my breath away when i first walked in. i turned up the air conditioning &amp; let it run, but the underlying odor was still there. | also, the much lauded floor heating in the bathroom either did not work or was not on. sure, it is august &amp; warm outside but my feet love a nice warm bathroom floor. | the good. housekeeping was fantastic. efficient &amp; always left plenty of towels &amp; toiletries. i will have to say the turndown chocolates are almost the best i have ever had (the truffles at fearrington house in nc are the best). | i also appreciated the easy to use lighting system. | whatever problems they may have had in the past with the internet service seems to have been resolved. it was fast enough that i could use skype &amp; download video. | i also have to say that breakfast at the northall is really, really expensive. i am usually of the mind that if you can afford to stay at a hotel like the corinthia you can afford to eat in their restaurant. however, in this case i really do think they are gouging the guest. the buffet is 32.00 (about $50.00). the a la carte menu is a little more reasonable except coffee beverages &amp; tea are 5.50 - that is about $8.50. sorry, but that is crazy. if you exit the hotel by the side door near the harrods &amp; turn left, there is a garfunkel's restaurant that opens at 7:00 am. there is also a costa coffee in the waterstones across the street from garfunkel's. it is on the first floor. | in short, if you need a soft mattress this is not the hotel for you (at this time).'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''great location, service and decor could be better. service is standard but could be better considering this is supposed to be one of the best hotels. | the london manadrin is overpriced compared to a few of the others. | good rooms, i think they should all have fantastic views but sadly do not. good spa, but | again very expensive. i consider myself fairly well off but the prices were shocking. nice bar area. | if you want to be in knightsbridge and have a good amount to spend then this is for you. although, for tourists wanting to experience | the 'real' london atmosphere then consider another area, such as, london bridge, covent garden or shoreditch as knightsbridge is overrun with wealthy foreigners, | where the typical sights of london many come to see has been lost.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the hotel was just minutes away by black cab from paddington station, so we were in our room within 90 minutes of landing at heathrow. it is location is really it is only strength - a short stroll to south kensington tube station, in the heart of museum/gallery territory, lovely cafes and a couple of minutes walk form harrods etc. | our room was comfortable, clean, but the noise form outside permeated obtrusively at night and the floor creaked badly, as did the rooms directly above us. | breakfast was grim - a tepid affair of poor choice (especially the continental section) and the staff in the breakfast room were finding it hard to be happy, efficient, or polite. we stayed at easter and the hotel was very busy, the result being that we were sent to an adjoining conference room for breakfast - quite shabby conference tables for eating breakfast, and nasty paper napkins in a '4 star' hotel.... we will find another place for our next visit.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''look elsewhere for a hotel there are many great ones in london and this is no longer one of them. this hotel is pretty shocking for the price and was definitely not up to the standard you expect from the mandarin group. the atmosphere although friendly is pretty complacent. our room was stuffy airless and smelt smoky. the hotel charges 6 an hour for the internet. say no more. the bathroom had been partly refurbished, but the enamel on our bath was peeling and the bath generally looked dirty and in need of re-enamelling. the shower screen had lost its silicone edging so the shower water flooded the bathroom floor. our duvet cover had holes in it (yes this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel), and the aircon was noisy. on the plus side the carpet was smart, but overall the room felt tired and in dire need of refurbishment. to cap it all at breakfast my partner had the smoked haddock which smelt very strongly when it arrived. the portion was large and there were two pieces of fish, one of which was all right the other tasted and smelt poor, and was not eaten. when the waitress asked if all was ok with our meal we mentioned the fish, and were told 'do not worry all our fish is smelly!'. she checked with the kitchen who merely said both pieces of fish came from the same box. no apology. no offer of an alternative, or even an offer not to charge for the inedible fish. by this stage we were pretty fed up with breakfast anyway (how can they charge 7 for a single crumpet!!) and it did not add to our joyless overall experience. my advice? stay at the connaught, claridges or browns where the guest still comes first and none of the above occurs.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the hotel foyer is messy, climbing the stairs to my room i had to climb over building material and tools, door was paper thin and i could hear every grunt and groan from the next door occupants. the staff were very friendly and helpful. i had two nights here as i could not be bothered to move, but found a nearby hotel for my second visit the following week. the room was smaller than tiny, for the money paid i think it was overpriced.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at the rembrandt 10 years ago and had fond memories of it, so i booked us a 4 night stay when we were in london prior to our cruise. this time our impressions were more mixed. we arrived about 3pm after our flight from sfo. the main entrance was closed due to work being done on it and we had to walk up a steep ramp. our baggage was carried in for us. i stood at the desk for a couple of minutes before being acknowledged by any of the people working there. eventually someone acknowledged me and checked us in. a very nice man (celio?) took our bags up and oriented us to the room, which was comfortably laid out and clean. i remember our previous room here as being larger and the bed a king rather than a queen, but the bed size was immaterial. it was very comfortable. the bathroom had marble tile floors that were heated a little bit when the lights were on and the bathtub was a good size w/ handles to help getting in and out safely. | breakfast is included in the room price. i have pleasant memories of it from the past, but like the hotel itself, breakfast this time was more mixed. scrambled eggs on a breakfast buffet are always a dicey proposition, but these were among the worst i have tried. one bite and done. the sausage embodied the worst of british breakfast sausages in both texture and taste. there were pale potato-like things i did not try and beans i did not try either. but the fresh fruit was terrific. surprisingly sweet watermelon and crenshaw melon, adequate orange slices and excellent green apples. there was an assortment of decent if unadventurous packaged cheeses. they also had a selection of canned apricot and other canned fruits. there were pastries and cereals and juices and other offerings. we had two breakfasts there, having overslept breakfast hours two of the mornings. the second breakfast i chose more carefully, avoiding the cooked foods in favor or the fruit, cheeses and yogurt. | most annoyingly, saturday the maid cleaning the room tossed out my wife's contact lens case. i cannot understand how or why she did that. she discovered it when she went to take her lenses out. she called the front desk and reported it, to an audible gasp at the other end. soon a woman named karen knocked on our door w/ two small ramekins to store her lenses overnight, which worked just fine. we talked about going to boots the next day to pick up a new case and she said she would reimburse us. the next morning we went downstairs and the concierge called boots and reached a recording saying they were closed. he found another drugstore, harvey's, i think, and i confirmed that they had cases. harvey's was a bit of a trek, so we took a taxi over and back. the case was 2 and the taxi 11 total. we returned to the hotel and alan, who had kept receipts for both, asked to be reimbursed. the staff called karen, who reimbursed us for the case, but explained she was not authorized to reimburse for taxis. that was ok. what was not ok was that she chided us for not having pushed to have someone on staff go over to pick up the case, which we had not known was an option. | a final irritation was that when our driver came yesterday morning to take us to southampton to meet the ship, he was there about 15 minutes early w/o the front desk staff telling us. there was no effort to connect us w/ him and it was only by good fortune that we did connect when we came down to the lobby w/ the bellman and our luggage. happily the driver was patient and persistent in coming in to the lobby repeatedly and did not just leave. in all, if was not attentive or accommodating service and we would not stay here again, despite the excellent location and the comfortable room. all in all, i do not feel it was at all a good value for the price.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we booked a suite with the full butler service experience. however, due to an oversight the butler element was missed and the room category over exaggerated. i appreciate problems happen - you cannot possibly run a hotel of this size without a few errors in service etc. however, my concern here is thatt when things did start to go wrong and we questioned why we were not receiving the butler service it felt as if all the front desk attendant was interested in was telling me that the issue rested with our misunderstanding and their recent change in how they categorise the rooms (that is not as per website or in-room documentation). it was only by walking downstairs to see one one face to face and that they eventually agreed they had failed to deliver as per our reservation. when then assured us they would correct the situation, we were disappointed that this failed to happen, eventually things started to get better but it was too little too late. | they of course apologised again, but a true 5 star hotel would not keep getting it wrong. we did however have a few items removed from our bill and a few free drinks as way of an apology, but to be honest when you are paying 600+ per night, a few pounds refund is immaterial, it is the experience we wanted and very willing to pay for. | very comfortable bed, great pool and gym and lovely room service - top quality food. | i imagine this could be a great place to stay providing nothing goes wrong, as if it does the default position will be the customers error followed by an admission of blame but with little substance. a 'good news only' hotel i think. | also, we booked the 'couples harmony massage' and this was not completed together but instead in two separate treatment rooms. when we challenged this we were told that it is not meant to be in the same room! i have travelled all over the world and a spa treatment titled 'harmony couples massage' is without exception completed side by side in the same room! i would have had more sympathy if they had admitted to double booking the couples room or an admin error in booking etc as opposed to making question my sanity! | we had moved from the mayfair hotel, especially to experience the savoy, i wish we had remained at the mayfair!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''badly designed bath and toilet, toiletries and biscuits not refreshed, wineglasses not washed. each time we have visited, it has cost more, and we seem to get less. biscuits used to be of quality, now they are cheap. four night stay saves money on laundry, admin etc., but no biscuits after the first night.

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''this hotel's rankings of #207 overall and #137 for luxury properties, pretty well sums up the situation. the building looks great and the location is excellent, so why the low rankings? | first, the high prices because the guest to have some expectation for service and facilities | that is rarely met. at these prices, one can easily stay in a top 10 ranked hotel in london. | overall very inconsistent service at all levels, each stay is a new adventure that may be | ok or very unpleasant. the other impression one quickly gets is that management and | staff really do not care. | on my last stay ( and this was my final stay), i was having an unpleasant check-in and | asked for the manager, i was told he was busy and he would contact me shortly, | checking out 2 days later,i had never been contacted. do not waste your money at this hotel, | so many better options available.'''",1
London Guest House,"'''we stayed at the lgh in april-whilst travelling to a gig at the scala.its positioning was ideal for easy movement around london-without having to pay any congestion charge.we literally arrived,parked and used the tube,which is only a short walk away-to either the acton or north acton station-dependent on where you want to visit. | our stay was only for a couple of days and we were allocated an upstairs room on the top floor. | the only issues that we had were,initially,the head room in the room that we were initially given (i think it was number 304?) -it was a bit too low for us as it sloped,meaning that you had to crouch.over a period of time,this would have been a bit of a pain. | our stay in this room was short lived as the toilet in our room became blocked and nearly overflowed-other than a minor inconvenience,this itself was not a problem,because of the way that the issue was dealt with-quickly and decisively by the staff. | by this,i mean,we were moved to an alternative room straight away-bottom floor(this was a nicer room as it had more headroom!).i personally,would not have been happy staying in the initial room whilst someone unblocked the toilet-for obvious reasons! | this in itself showed me a good level of customer service and would make me return to this hotel. | the only other,small issue that i had was the cleanliness of the bathroom in the first room.i looked into the sink and there was a creamy coloured slime inside the plug hole and on the back of the plug-i do not know what it was,but it did not look very nice and i cleaned this myself... | there is a small parking area-which appears to be exclusive to the hotel.it is semi-secure as the 24 hr reception backs onto the office.this is a real bonus for a hotel-especially in london! | the room does have wi-fi but you hae to pay for this-no dramas... | all in all,i would recommend this hotel for its location,customer service,off road parking price. | i found our stay very good and your hotel was very well situated for our visit.with its locality to the acton tube station,this was ideal for us. | the only issues that we had were,initially,the head room in the room that we were initially given (i think it was number 304?) -was a bit too low for us.over a period of time,this would have been a bit of a pain. | you may be aware that the toilet in our room became blocked and nearly overflowed-other than a minor inconvenience,this itself was not a problem,because of the way that the issue was dealt with-quickly and decisively. | by this,i mean,we were moved to an alternative room straight away-bottom floor(this was a nicer room as it had more space+headroom!).i personally,would not have been happy staying in the initial room whilst someone unblocked the toilet-for obvious reasons! | this in itself showed me a good level of customer service and would make me return to your hotel. | the only other,small issue that i had was the cleanliness of the bathroom in the first room.i looked into the sink and there was a creamy coloured slime inside the plug hole and on the back of the plug-not very nice and i cleaned this myself... | so,to conclude-7 out of 10-raised because of the customer service re the issue with the toilet!'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed one night (sat) at the mondrian for our anniversary and although the hotel is great from an ambience and decor perspective, my experience suggests that there are quite a few things missing to make it worth the cost @ 299 for the night. | here is the abbreviated version. | nice hotel, looks good, has a big hotel price for a small hotel way of thinking. | service as a hotel guest, sucks. | for the longer version, feel free to read on. | location wise the hotel is in a good spot - near to a overland train (blackfriars), an underground (southwark) and right on the river. the styling of the hotel is for sure worthy of the name they really have put the work in and succeeded in the mood setting through styling. | there were a few things that we found frustrating. | i contacted someone at guest services when i booked to let them know it was a special occasion and received a message back giving me the schpeil that they would look after us. i did not ask for anything except to get a room with a nice view of the river. | on the internet you can find lots of good guest images of the rooms with nice views (on this website too) so that was what i was hoping to get. | what i got was an ok view (at best) - you can judge for yourself (see pics) if you think the room i got was good enough considering i told them it was an occasion. | i did not think so personally. i thought they could have done better. | guest services did leave us a little letter (see pics) offering 2 free drinks in any of their bars. a nice touch for sure, but you have to get in to their bars first. more on that later. | the room decor was nice (see pics) and the hotel itself is well styled but the room itself was a bit of a frustration for me. | first the bathroom door did not lock. | also - the shower (which was a big rainfall and very nice) was medium warm and when i turned the tap across to h, it somehow got, colder. | let me remind you again this is no cheap hotel. | believe it or not, considering the prices, you had to put a key card in to turn the lights and air-con on. now some might say that is about being environmentally conscious, but in my experience of visiting hotels all around the world - that is about one thing, saving money. i found it annoying when i wanted to charge my phone while i was out and we like to have a nice cold room to return to, but we turn off the air con when we are in the room. can you get around it with more than one key card - yes - but when you pay above average rates for your room, i do not think that tallies with that experience, personally. | i paid for a superior room which comes with a 'queen' bed (superior = queen bed, erm?). and the bed is at best a queen, i am 6ft, with my head about 4-5 inches from the headboard, my feet were off the end of the bed. so if you are used to a us style 'queen', no chance. | you can also have a look at the mini-bar charges for yourself (see pic) - i thought 12 for airplane size alcohol was a bit cheeky personally. | check-in was slow, queued for ~10 mins and it took at least 10 mins for me to be checked in through their laborious process. i also am not a fan of the 100 card charge on every room immediately at check-in. that is a small hotel attitude for a business that wants to be a 'big hotel' or, at least is charging as one. ask for a card, sure, but taking cash right off i find quite cheap. | also check-out cannot be done on the phone. the leave some little card asking you to put your email and they will auto check you out and you can just drop your key. | in fact. guest services cannot do much. | called them to organise rr, they had to call that department. | asked for a second key when i realised the key = air con situation. they had to call the front desk. | called them to check out. they said they could not do anything themselves. | must be a great job - not having to actually do anything. may as well just call them - switchboard - would be more accurate. | our biggest annoyance by far was the service as a hotel guest though. | when i booked the guest services team offered (i did not ask) to get us a table at one of their bars, i picked the rumpus room on the top floor and asked for a window seat as it is rooftop bar with good views. again, they knew the occasion. | they came right back to me, the first time, but then i had to chase them to get confirmation of the booking. eventually i got a phone call - they did the usual ""we will do our best to accommodate you"" thing to give them some deniability. i should have known from then what would happen, but i hoped. | our dinner reservation moved, so when i checked in i asked to move the rr booking from 2230 to 2300 as they will only hold a table for 15 mins. front desk called the rr, and was promptly told ""no"". consider, that is a 15 minute delta. straight no, i could tell from the poor girl on the desk stuttering with her team on the phone. remember again, she is calling for a hotel guest paying a not exactly small amount for a room. did not matter. | luckily we made it on time, went up to the rr, fairly long queue - none of whom were guests. we were guests though, so we would not have to queue would we?... ha, of course we did, because the fact were guests is of no consequence. | when we got to the check-in person, i asked if we had a window seat. nope. the guy was very curt as if my asking was me taking the p, when i mentioned i asked and booked a couple days back, his swift and demeaning response was that ""people book their tables 6 months to a year in advance"". now, let me be clear, this rooftop bar is nice, but to be booked a year in advance, i do not think so. you can book the place online. | either way, again, i am a guest, he knows that, the booking tells him that, he does not care. | so, if you are thinking because you are paying the hotel a fairly hefty amount you are going to get treated better than the person who walked in off the street. guess again. | and that is probably why it is highly unlikely we will go back to the mondrian. | their service does not come close to the styling and for me, i pay for service first, not a nice looking chair in my room.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,'''the hotel is a short walk fromm goodge street underground on the northern line. i had a lovely greeting on arrival. the room was adequate for my needs. with no air conditioning the window was open which allowed the noise of the busy street in. no toiletries for the shower. good breakfast with attentive staff.''',1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''real shame! i have stayed at a lot of their brands around the world, new york, miami and all the others in london. this was a complete joke! | i know it is new but you would think some basic knowledge training for all staff would have been a must? | bear with me with this review, it might be long but you will see why. | i paid for a patio room hoping for some extra space but alas no! the view from the patio of a half completed hotel and the building site opposite was a nice surprise. the rooms were small at best, decorated well though and the bathrooms looked cool. but man, my cat swinging, was completely limited in that room! | it was the staff that let the place down. great receptionist but then it went down hill. we found our rooms, eventually, threw the cases in and decided a drink from the newest coolest bar was a must. we knew it was up top somewhere. we raced to the lift and waited and waited and waited! in fact over the 24 hour period we ended up spending nearly 20 minutes waiting for lifts in corridors! we went to the top floor and realised we might be a floor too high. we asked a chamber maid, pointing out of the huge glass window to what we thought was the bar below. ""no"", she said, ""that is the swimming pool, i do not know where the bar is"". okay, let us go down to the ground floor again and ask. waited for a lift to arrive, went and found a guy behind a desk, it was not the pool after all, it was the bar we wanted but we were too high. ""it opens at midday"" he said. great, off we went, right floor this time, waited for the lift ( there is a theme emerging here) went to the correct floor, found the bar, door locked! waited for the lift, back down to the ground floor, different guy, bar opens when? 18.00!!! | ""where is another bar?"" ""ground floor."" "" is it open"" he says, yes! great. by now i needed a beer. very cool bar it was, sat down, looked at the 8 draft pumps. my mouth now so dry with all the running around, the anticipation of the amber nectar was at its maximum. ""a pint of your finest draft beer please"", i said, ""we do not have any""' said the barman! ""what?"" ""you have 8 pumps!"", i said, ""they are for show"" he said! had a bottle of beer and ordered a burger. it was a great burger, really really good. | whilst waiting, we went to mr concierge and asked for a car in ninety minutes time to take us to twickenham. all good, time to relax. ninety minutes later, no car and no concierge either. shift change, no notes and no booking. saw original concierge leaving the hotel on his way home, asked him where our car was, that cheeky happy concierge, wait for it...""oh, i forgot to order it""! cannot explain the proceeding conversation as it will not get printed here. ended up being fifteen minutes late for the kick off! | late that night back to the top floor bar, or swimming pool, depending which staff member you ask. spent literally fifteen minutes sat at the bar waiting for a drink, fifteen minutes, and we were thirty centimetres away from the staff, it took a slight toy throwing moment to get served! had one drink as i was fast losing the will to live. | went to bed in my tiny room. comfy bed. slept. | the next day must be a better day, a hearty breakfast was required. it was good food overall. | but get this. i order the full english, but then they have the audacity to charge extra for everything else that goes with it. to eat toast with your full english is extra, orange juice, extra, coffee well that is extra too. hells bells! | so am i going back? i will give it one more go but not for a year. hopefully they would have fired all the incompetent people by then and maybe the management might have got a grip. i hope so, it could be great. a hotel cannot survive just because it tries to be cool, it needs warm knowledgeable people to make it happen. | shame, i was really looking forward to it.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we went after watching the refurbishment programme on t.v. the foyer was impressive but where we sat and had our tea was a huge disappointment. there was a horrendous stain on the carpet right next to our table. the food was ok but certainly no quirky little extras that other plush hotels offer(check out claridges). the waiting staff were polite but seemed more interested in the americans. it was supposed to be smart dress but the yanks,obviously staying in the hotel were all in their t shirts and trainers just come in from a day trekking around the city. they were loud and spoiled our visit. we save hard for this sort of trip and felt let down. there were also people with pushchairs in there. definitely a no no in my opinion. high tea is high tea. but that is how the other half live i guess.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we stayed one night for our 5th anniversary. we had booked the romantic package. we had travelled up in the morning and expected to be in our room by 2pm to freshen up and be ready for our show at 3pm. on arriving we were told our room was not ready even though we were there at 1.55, and we had been moved to an edwardian room instead of the art deco one we had booked. we went to the american bar for a coffee and to say i was happy was an understatement. we could not sit where we wanted to and were sat almost on top of another couple we may just as well been with them. i wen to the ladies and noticed lifts and corridors leading off here and there. just as well as the man who booked us in gave us our cards to the room and said can you find your own way. we found the lift went up to our room and would you believe no cases . by this time we did not have much time to do anything but freshen up just as well i did not need anything our of my case. we also noticed there was no champagne in the room which was part of the package. having enjoyed a great show the highlight for me was simpsons in the strand never let us you down had a wonderful dinner there as we have done many times. the room was very nice and the bed was very comfortable had a great nights sleep. the breakfast i cannot fault and great service. that morning we also noticed we had no flowers that should have been part of the package. would i stay there again no. we are going to eat at kaspers in may and i am hoping it does not let us down it has some great reviews.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''king beds are very hard to come by in london, so our hotel choices were somewhat limited. stayed two nights in april 2011 with my husband and our 8-year old. the room we got was not one of the nicer-looking rooms shown on the website, but it had a pretty view over a quiet garden space. overall the hotel was quiet. aesthetically i would sum it up as faded grandeur. a bit worn but overall decent. i suspect it is mostly a business hotel. definitely not romantic and not family-friendly in particular, despite the website's claims. | breakfast, despite what i would read in other reviews, could not be faulted. it was more than plentiful (truly restaurant-style), hot and run efficiently if rather brusquely. the breakfast definitely added value to our stay. we paid 269 pounds/night. | hotel was under 10 minute walk from s. kensington tube stop - but a bit tricky to find the first time out, as the tube empties onto a very busy roundabout and it is anyone's guess which way to thurloe place. | on the negative side: service at the front is not exactly up to standard. i was travelling alone with my daughter (husband joining us the next day) and was wheeling two suitcases and a backpack. the doorman took a look at me on the sidewalk - and walked away leaving me to navigate a small staircase and doorway unassisted. not so great. front desk staff perfunctory at best. no one really smiled or acknowledged us as we came or went, despite the hotel lobby being very small. it is a small point, perhaps, if you are looking for value and location this hotel is good. service disappoints. | we also felt a bit ripped off by the additional charge to use the swimming pool. it is a nice (albeit basement level) pool but the charge of 7 pounds per person is not worth it. kids only allowed in until 5:00, so we could not use the pool in the evening after sight-seeing. | i would not not recommend. but i would not stay again unless i needed to be in the immediate area. we walked to harrod's in about 20 minutes, and all of the amazing, free london museums are quite literally at the doorstep.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''whilst i cannot fault front of house, location, quality of fittings, cleanliness etc even as a petite 5 foot 3 i struggled with the shower room. the folding door only opened half way due to the loo, making it almost impossible to turn the shower on without getting in it and risking that first freezing blast of water. although advertised as a double and, to be fair contained a double bed, it was up against a wall on one side meaning a scramble over the other person or a slither to the bottom to get in or out. sorry, but not worth the price i paid for room only.'''",1

Newham Hotel,"'''we were looking for a hotel or b&amp;b in and around stratford area when we chanced upon the newham hotel. just needed a place to crash and have breakfast as we were to spend most of our time outside. booked a quadruple room for 3 of us as it was costing just a bit more than the triple room and offered more value. | the hotel is a 10 min bus ride from stratford with buses running every 5-10 min. also, there is a round-the-clock direct bus route 25 that will take you to oxford circus in about an hour. the hotel building and rooms were old and showed their age. however, the carpets across the hotel seemed refurbished recently. rooms and bathrooms were spacious and reasonably clean; nothing gross or unsightly. breakfast was served from 6:30 am which was a huge advantage whenever we needed to leave early; adequate variety as well. wi-fi was free and worked well most of the times. | most of the staff was friendly and helpful with the exception of 1 or 2 who seemed disinterested. the heater in our room did not work on the first day and it was quite cold. provided a replacement heater temporarily and the room heater too was fixed in a couple of days. water pressure in the shower was feeble and the shower doors did not close completely leading to a ""flooded"" dry area after a shower. only 1 room key card was provided. | this is an economy category accommodation where all things were functional. worked out well for us though this might not be the case every time.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the rhodes hotel was a bit shabbier than we expected. we booked a double deluxe room - room 227. other reviews on tripadvisor said glowing things, so i think i just expected something better. i hear this is good quality for this amount of money in london, though. the bathroom was smallish, but very clean and not uncomfortable. the room was large with a couch, comfy bed, flat screen tv - but there were strange stains on one wall, one of the coffee mugs was dirty, and the carpet was very, very cheaply laid (buckling and bubbling as you walk on it). all in all, not bad - but like i said, rough around the edges and not the ""gem"" as i would heard it described on this site. | location was great. close to paddington station and the lancaster gate tube station and close to many restaurants and small shops. | when we closed the window, it blocked out all the street noise below and we slept great (which i had not expected). | rhodes hotel has free wireless internet, which is a huge plus in my book. even some of the chain hotels do not offer that! | breakfast was decent. warm toast was delivered right to our table as we sat down - fruit, cereal, tea, coffee, etc was available.'''",1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''my friend and i booked this hotel for a 10 day stay and to save on cost we opted to share. we booked a standard twin room and while i had read reviews was unprepared for how small the room really was. with two people with four cases there was no way we were going to fit, luckily we were able to negotiate for an upgrade to the deluxe twin room at a reasonable rate and while this was small also it at least had a couch we could use for luggage and it had a bath tub. i would recommend that the standard room might be ok for a single traveller with minimal luggage but for two people then get the larger room. | the staff in the hotel were lovely and very helpful, the doormen were very knowledgable and we received tiny cakes every night when we got back. | i did not partake of the restaurant as i was out and about as soon as possible and often back quite late. there is also a bar in the lobby. the room facilities were good but there is no fridge if you need to store medication (there is not room for one really). an in room tablet was supplied but we unplugged it as we needed the powerpoint for device charging. | the location is about four blocks from gloucester road tube station in the kensington area. it is within walking distance of kensington palace, the natural history museum, royal albert hall and the v &amp; a museums. there is also a supermarket right next door which does generate a bit of noise if you are on that side of the hotel. there are also about 6 italian restaurants within a few blocks if you want to eat out. it is on the blue piccadilly line, green district line and yellow circle lines so getting about is easy if you have an underground map. | one unfortunate incident was the fire alarms going off at 9:30pm one night and when i went to ask if there was a problem was told they were being tested. i understand fire alarms are very important but not notifying guests that it is a test and not an actual emergency was unsettling.'''",1
The Dorchester,'''as part of my mums visits to see me in london we have been trying afternoon tea and cocktails at various hotels. this time we decided that cocktails at the dorchester were in order. whilst the hotel is lovely it can lookma little more tired than some of it is counterparts and is more understated. the bar i would say is too modern and does not fit in with the atmosphere of the hotel. the barmen were friendly and the cocktails were delicious if quite small for the price however there is no getting away from the lack of atmosphere that you get at other bars such as the bar at the savoy.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''when we arrived at the mondrian hotel the staff were fantastic, very polite and professional. our room was lovely and spacious but the light switches were all over the place! we had a business meeting at the hotel later on that afternoon and the hotel staff service there was great too. we had booked into the mondrian restaurant for our evening meal due to it being my birthday and did not fancy going out. we got seated at a window table in the restaurant with a fab view of lit up london. a waiter took our drinks order only to be told 5 minutes later ""i am sorry the waiter who took your order is new here and he did not understand what you wanted"" come on a susie q cocktail and a bottle of samuel adams.....we opted for the set menu at a cost of 30, which we were later told gives you smaller portions as the price is reduced! so beware a steak main meal gave us two small long thin pieces of steak on a tablespoon of puree'd carrot, bonemeal gratin (a large bone with crumbled bonemarrow on) and couple of hard sprouts....... | our nights sleep was lovely and quiet none of the usual noise from guests up and down the corridors, doors banging, toilets flushing etc.........breakfast in the restaurant was average, staff a little run off their feet.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''i usually go to the berkeley just across the road but love the mandarin oriental in hong kong and kuala lumpur so thought ill try the one in london. unfortunately they do not compare. the rooms at the mo in london are old fashioned and lack the style of the berkeley. the bar is not that spectacular either although the opening of bar boulud will make a great difference. its a nice enough hotel but i am not sure its worth the money unless you want the convenience of being right by hyde park and knightsbridge.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''you cannot beat the location, especially for business. being in such a noteworthy building, i had high hopes for the interior treatment. the lobby is fun. upstairs, the hallways are dark and the rooms are small. i get what the hotel is going for in terms of trying to be hip, but they are missing the mark as it is. | my room was not dirty, but it was not clean, either. it was very dusty and the floor showed evidence of going awhile since its last vacuuming. | would i return? yes. the staff was very friendly and i am sure the restaurant will get better. even at that, if you need to be in the south bank area around blackfriars, it is a good choice.'''",1

Newham Hotel,"'''it was totally a mistake to choose this hotel and that place at all. i am so disappointed this time of london!!! around this hotel for all my stay i have not seen any european face!!! nightmare. i know there are a lot of migrants in london - but i did not know there are places where there are only them for many kilometers. also, all the road to stratford metro station is a long row of some sort of damned little transparent barber shops for blacks - so i needed to see all their damned hair cut and shaved all the time for all my way. look - it almost made me vomity. the place itself is so veeeery good-looking by its architecture - but where are normal londoners??? where on earth did they go? | the hotel was not so bad -only they lied about that there was wi-fi in the rooms (which i needed very much to know the details of my trip!), then they said it did not work temporarily... but later i read comments on the other site that it had not worked either. it cannot be always out of servise!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here for one night as a last minute booking, booked via secret escapes so got this stay at a discounted price so glad i did not pay full price. staff were welcoming on arrival, we went straight up to room, you need to scan your card to get to the level you want which is good. the room was clean and tidy with nice new decor, lovely bath even with jets. tea, coffee, bottles of water, iron bard etc available. could not hear much noise which is always a bonus. but the bed was so uncomfortable, which let the hotel down. nothing worse, in the morning i did not feel like i had a goo nights sleep. breakfast was included and had a wide variety. waitress was available to get drinks and deal with any requests. this is a nice hotel and well furbished but i just think its over priced, your paying for the postcode. good area to stay in, only 5 minutes walk from harrods, 10 minutes from hyde park, royal albert hall. across the road from the v&amp;a museaum.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''my partner wanted to take me here as part of my ' significant' birthday celebration! not an overnight stay but a couple of cocktails before dinner with the family! he rang ahead and the american bar did not take reservations. we arrived at 6pm and we had to go on a waiting list which was approx 40 minutes....but we could have a drink at the standing bar whilst we waited.... we were clearly a party of 4 - 2 adults over 50 and 2 teenage girls 17+. having waited patiently for 30 minutes plus we approached the bar reception but we were then asked for id for the girls! being an international hotel this felt a little odd....but rules are rules... it would have been far better to have told us this when we asked for a table! when we asked if there was anywhere else in the hotel where we could all sit together to have a drink ( they were on lemonade!,) they suggested we left and go elsewhere.....such a shame but our girls are incredibly resilient and feel quite proud of the fact that they were asked to leave the savoy!'''",1
The Savoy,'''we were not told about the renovation and the noise. they moved us upon our complaint. | we have informed them about our change of arrival but they did not release our 1st night and charge us. they told us because we did not inform them to release the 1st night. what is the purpose of informing them the change of arrival date and still being charged. | breakfast was nice. the staff was attentive. | bell boy is friendly and chatty. | front office needs a training.''',1
The Rembrandt,"'''i paid for a club room on booking.com and when i got my room (room 666) the photos did not match the ones on booking.com. i was told to complain to booking.com about it but the photos are still up on the site and i feel if the rembrandt are going to be available on booking.com they should take some responsibility and make sure it is correct. i was moved begrudgingly to a better room but it had soft, decaying apples on the table and the bathroom was small. the rooms seriously need a renovation if someone is paying more than au$600 per night - i chose the rembrandt imagining i would get an elite hotel and found it old and tired. i tried to print out a book contract on the computers in the lobby and the printer had run out of ink. i had to organise to get someone from the front desk to print it. none of this suggests a hotel with as many stars or costs as much as it does. the breakfast was pretty bad - the eggs overcooked (not runny), the tomatoes waterlogged and the juice containers appeared dirty and had drip tray saucers underneath, again, i would not expect this from a hotel like the rembrandt. the bar/lounge was ok but, again, i would not expect to have televisions playing in there. i am afraid i was really disappointed in the experience and will stay somewhere else next time. just as a note: a club room should only be called a club room if you have a club lounge. i booked this room also believing i would have access to a club room for the extra money it is deceptive and i was told many other people had mistaken the same thing. call it something else!'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed at the mondrian for one night for a weekend shopping trip in london. a couple of days before my stay i received an email offering an upgrade for 35. the information was a bit basic but i clicked to enquire and booked it unknowingly. during check in they charged another 7 vat ontop of this which was not mentioned on the website (if it was it was incredibly small print). | check in was ok, but the member of staff was not particularly welcoming - not what you expect when paying 250 a night. | the room was nice and modern, well decorated apart from the splash of paint ""art"" on the wall which was not to taste. after we arrived in the room someone spent 2-3 minutes trying to get it. after getting fed up of him pulling the handle and scanning his card i told him he would got the wrong room. he insisted he was given this room and went back to reception, no idea what happened but he did not return. | the view from the room was not great and i did not really find value in the 35 (42) upgrade. i was disappointed i paid it, thinking i would have a much better scape of the city. | generally the hotel is nice and modern, clean throughout. i probably would stay here again if i got a good deal, but would not pay the extra for a ""view"" as it is not worth it.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i can tell, our room was very small and two people can be difficult to navigate but televisor lcd was great. the bed is big and comfortable. the bathroom is a miniature but nice and clean. in the closet, we had electric tea maker and refrigerator. our room is located in the building where the reception was, so we had breakfast on the walk 70 meters every day the same monotonous breakfast, toast, butter, one kind of salami and one kind of cheese, cereal, yogurt, coffee, tea and fruit. the hotel staff was ok.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''booked this hotel on 28th december for a surprise birthday treat for my husband. check in was fine. we were given a voucher for a complimentary drink as it was a special trip. paid an addtional 45 for a room overlooking the thames. went to the bar around 2pm to be told we could not enter as we did not have a reservation so we went out. came back later and changed for a show i had booked. after the show we returned to the hotel at around 10.45pm as we thought we would redeem our voucher and have a few more drinks to complete our lovely evening. went to the bar to be told....no reservation, no entry...again!!! we sat in the coffee area to be told we could not get a drink or coffee as that area was now closed!!!!! incredibly upset by now, i spoke to the duty manager who was very apologetic and offered us a complimentary breakfast. he did offer us a coffee but it was too late by then and we wanted to finish our evening in the bar. not possible! | breakfast was a sham. more staff than you could imagine but waited over 5 minutes to be offered a coffee. the food was ok but trying to get a refill of a hot drink seemed impossible. we asked 2 waiters and was ignored both times. we were then presented with a bill for 45.00 for 2 breakfasts!! again i had to explain to the restaurant manager this was supposed to be complimentary. such a lack of communication. | overall the mondrian hotel was a massive let down and spoilt the end of a lovely day for my husbands birthday. i will not be recommending this hotel to my friends.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we came here for our honeymoon, and i have to say, this was unfortunately the damp squib of the whole trip. i have been to many a grande luxe property, and the common areas are really beautiful and charming, but the room was really nondescript. we had sort of been hoping for a nice view, as i know that a few of the junior suites and suites have river views. but we got sort of rooftop air-conditioning unit views a bit. the room was not some palatial, sumptuous lap of luxury either. it was fine; the bed was comfortable and very nice; but the rest of the room was not that much. i have had better at half the price. | since it was the off-season, and it was our honeymoon, i had allowed myself to hope for a bit of an upgrade; but there was none. they did leave a couple of miniature chocolate cakes in honor of the honeymoon, but that was it. other hotels on the trip did upgrades and other such things to help us out. that is not the bulk of my complaint, i just mean this paragraph as a tiny aside; i hate to be a whinger who complains about their special occasion not getting much recognition. but it felt a little bit muted, considering what other hotels on our trip did. and we sure could have done with a nicer view than the one our king room offered. | the main thing, really, was simply the cost--this would be a fine hotel if it were 200, even a few hundred pounds per night. the room service was just fine; good food. the service was fine. the location in town cannot be beat, and of course it is a bit of a historic hotel. but this is just simply too pricey for what you get. there is better in town. sorry to say it.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''charging for wifi and morning paper and no tea/coffee facilities in the room looks cheap. i love the savoy and all it is history but someone needs to sort this. you can get free wifi by joining a website, but the signal in the hotel is to weak to do this without wifi... which you cannot get on. |'''",1

The Savoy,"'''we booked a champagne afternoon tea as a treat on a trip to london in february. | we were a little early, but were told that our table was ready, and were seated on a two seater settee directly opposite the entrance to the room, with a rather low table set in front. there were cushions, which helped us to maintain a fairly upright posture, although it was not the most comfortable. as a result of the location of the table, we are now pictured in rather a lot of tourist photographs as they stood at the top of the steps to catch the image of the room!! ha ha. | our waiter introduced himself and served the champagne which was superb and in the most beautiful champagne flutes, but i am a sucker for lovely glassware! | the sandwiches and scones were then served and, whilst the scones were delicious - really light - the bread on the finger sandwiches was a little 'crusty' around the edges as if they had been prepared some time earlier. this was a bit surprising when considering the cost of the experience. some were also very bland and lacking in seasoning. | anyway, the second batch as provided a little while later were fresh and tasted a lot better. | in the meantime, the waiter asked us for our tea selection and we went for the savoy afternoon blend. he went on to tell us that the savoy use their own blend and then gave us a jug of milk each that 'they had made earlier that morning"" (??). odd! | when he came to pour the tea, he decided to use an interesting technique by trying the raise the teapot as far away from the cup and strainer as possible resulting in a stream of tea from spout to cup. this had the unfortunate result of spattering the tea leaves all around the edge of the cup, which i had to remove myself. he repeated the technique with my husbands cup, although this was slightly more successful with less tea leaf straying than before. | following the tea and scones, we were offered the pastries and i chose a macaroon which 'exploded' as soon as he tried to put it onto my plate. some of it went onto the plate and some onto me. despite this, i was not offered a fresh plate (mine being covered in meringue detritus) and he simply placed another macaroon next to the destroyed one. | after having so much tea and sugar, we could not fit any more cakes in so decided to pay. the waiter did actually ask if we wanted to take some cake with us, which we declined. | all in all, it was an experience that we wanted to try, although the premium inherent from a cost perspective was not justified in terms of the food and service and it was not as good as we expected it to be.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we arrived by foot as we travel relatively light and had things to do before check in. we seemed invisible to the doormen who did not greet us and were preoccupied with the taxis. this is fine, but on arrival to the lobby there was nobody intersted in helping us and we felt rather lost, not the 5 star welcome we were expecting. eventually someone did spot us struggling and we were shown to the room. other than this the good points were: excellent views and large room, helpful concierge and housekeeping. the downsides really were the doormen and lobby staff who throughout the stay seemed to focus on older guests (we are a young couple) and the lack of a personal touch.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i booked this as a surprise for my wife's 40th (a weekend in london). i mentioned this on booking.com who i booked with and understand this may not have been passed on to the hotel. | however upon checking in i explained why we were here and they could see that we have stayed a few times before. we we offered upgraded rooms but only for a price. ok it is a busy weekend i understand. what i find a little disappointing is that there was never any chocolates, wine, a flower.. anything from the hotel to acknowledge it was a special occasion. i booked sea containers on line for dinner one of the evenings and mentioned it was a special birthday and they brought out a cake and candle etc at the end (i would actually forgot i would mentioned it to them as booked weeks before) - this is how it should be done. | my main other main grievance is once again the rumpus room on saturday night was closed for a private party. that is twice now out of 3 times it is been closed and one of the main reasons i booked to stay. to make matters worse it is a roof top bar that does not open on a sunday afternoon. what a waste...we taxied over to montcalm hotel to sit drinking in the sun on their roof top bar all sunday afternoon. honestly mondrian you are missing a trick here. | lastly - the bluetooth would not pair with my phone so could not play music through the tv as it should do. it worked on our very first visit last year but on our last two visits (two different rooms) did not work. | overall.. just ""mah""... lovely hotel but will probably try others for a while next time we are visiting london.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''when my husband and i stayed at the dorchester we were very disappointed. we have stayed in many hotels in london and thought staying here would mean no problems, good service and everything as it should be - but it was not. when we first arrived the doorman and the lady at reception were very welcoming but during our stay we found some staff, especially in the breakfast and dining room were just indifferent. our superier king room was large, chintzy and a little old fashioned and we have certainly been in better. what did surprise us was the lack of tea making facilities. i would have thought, especially to 'the english' that would be important! almost all hotels in uk have such a facility even though in other parts of europe they do not. we did eventually have a tea tray well over two hours later but with only a huge (not very clean) kettle on it as if it had been taken from the staff room, two lovely tiny china teacups and nothing else! only to find the whole thing was taken away by the turn down service while we were at dinner. no morning cuppa then! i realise there is room service but there is no point in ringing for them as by the time the tea arrives at the door it would be cold or stewed. throughout our stay little things kept going wrong which on there own would not have been a problem but all together annoyed us. i think the hotel was too large for us as on our arrival the reception area was chaos, filled with people as there seemed to be several events going on as well as the whole of london drifting in and out or having afternoon tea. our dining experience in the grill which was a very cold room both for dinner and breakfast was very disappointing and breakfast was ordinary. | that visit will be our one and only stay at this hotel. having said all that i emailed the hotel after our stay and asked for the managers personal email address which was sent to me immediately. i then emailed my complaints and concerns about our stay at the dorchester and had a response almost by return email from john scanlon who responed well to my critisims. i have to give them ten out of ten for that.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i booked a junior suite at this hotel at a price of 810.90 for 1 night for my birthday. we arrived early as wanted todo some shopping in london, checked in and put our bags into hold as the room was not ready yet said we would be back around 2ish. came back at 2pm room was still not ready to be fair checkin stated was 3pm, waitied around then sat in the lobby. guy came over at 3:20pm and said he will now take us to our room. i was staying in room 226 (2nd floor) on aug 18th. we walked a few feet from the lift and he opned the door, as soon as we walked into the room there was a drastic change in smell, the guy seemed embarrsed after waiting around for over an hour we just wanted to get into the room. | he left and both me and my wife said at the same time it smells of smoke. the room smelt like an old london pub like everything had been sat in a smoking room for a few days, that musky nicotine smell you just cannot get rid of. instantly we opened the balcony doors and turned the fan/aircon to make to try and make it go away. | hugley disapointed after paying over 800 for 1 night in this room to be presented with this. | we are not really a moaning couple so decided that maybe with the doors open the smell would go+aircon. decided to get ready for a birthday dinner out. after coming back the smell was slightly better but it was late and just wanted to go to bed. | in the morning we both woke up with sore throats, and our new clothes which had been hanging in the room smelt of smoke. | it seems that either people smoke in this room due to the balcony or being on the 2nd floor the smoke from the courtyard goes into the room (maybe the aircon sucks it in or something) | another gripe was being so close to the lift shaft you could hear the lifts going up and down all night long....again not something i would expect to be placed next to for 800/night in a 5 star hotel. | i travel allot so have a good view of what a decent 5 star 1k/night should be - sadly this was not it.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i went for a massage during the weekend. the whole design and facilities are very impressive and clean. it even has a quite room for you to have a short nap! had a great massage from a skilled masseuse. service is great. the only suggestion i would like to give is to provide herbal/infusion tea instead of iced water right after the massage so that the body could be kept warm. overall, i will want to come back again for a spa! | after a very relaxing spa, i went to the lobby to have afternoon tea with my husband. we started around 5.40pm, however, we only managed to finish at 8.30pm due to the slowness of the service. we did not eat a lot, as the sandwiches are quite dry and desserts are too sweet. it was not a great experience because we had to wait for a long time for each food service (apart from the normal set, we only ordered one extra round of sandwiches and 3 extra desserts). the back door was opened by guests coming into the hotel from time to time, and there was no doorman looking after it so where we sit was sometimes very cold (my husband had to go and close it at least twice). i would really hope the hotel could have enough staff to look after the guests at the lobby and make sure that the service is smooth and attentive, to meet its 5-star standard.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''just returned for a weekend at the rembrandt with my husband. let us start with the positives. excellent location, room great and cleaned well. the handy phone provided is an excellent idea and i applaud the hotel for this idea. concierge guys so helpful and friendly, particularly the yorkshireman from whitby, sorry did not get his name but he is a credit to the hotel! | what we were not impressed with was the service received from other staff members, the receptionist who checked us in was probably the most miserable we have ever encountered. we had a 70 food credit included on the rate we had booked. the service was bad from start to finish. menu plonked down and when we ordered mussels then told they were not available, why not mention it when placing the menu? my husbands steak was ok but he had to leave half of it as he had requested medium rare and as half steak was quite thin the second half was well over cooked. it took about 20 minutes for our dirty plates to be removed and when they were my husband commented on the reason he had not been able to eat half of his steak. response i will mention it to chef that was it! bill brought over and no apology. we felt generally it was the staff that left the hotel down. a smile would go a long way and knowing how to deal with any negative comment essential.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''my partner and i stayed at the dorchester on jan 1st and 2nd. we checked in as usual and the receptionist (male) took us on a tour as it was our first visit, and one i was really looking forward to. he advised us of the signature restaurants at the hotel namely china tsang and alain ducasse. we went for a nap in the evening and as we rose late around 9pm we decided to eat at the china tsang which had been recommended. we were badly received and had to signal to the waiter to come and take our order.my partner ordered hot and sour soup &amp;lemon chicked and i ordered prawn stir fry. we knew the moment we got our dishes that it would be disappointing. the soup was like glue. my partner tried a few spoons hoping it would get better but it did not. the chicken was old and of the plastic type you get in very cheap chinese. my prawn dish was tasteless and covered in some clear gluey texture again with a side portion of the worst black bean sauce i have ever had. as we were very hungry we actually ate a few bites, once again hoping it would get better. it did not. it was awful. we did not complain at the restaurant as we are not complainers by nature. we went upstairs to the hotel bar to have a few drinks. however we had to ask for soda water and my partner had to go and walk outside for an hour to relieve himself of severe indigestion and upset tummy. the following morning we were still not feeling well and we had to have further upset tummy remedies. later that afternoon i decided i should say something to a manager as we had suffered so much. i asked the receptionist could i see a manager. she sent out a duty manager to me ( cannot remember his name but he had blond hair) i advised him of our experience. all he said was ""oh china tsang has nothing to do with the hotel they just rent the hotel space"" i advised him that it was recommended when we checked in as one of the hotel restaurants. he had no response. i actually grew up in the hotel business so i would have dealt with instances in my experience. the normal practice would be to apologise | profusely and make an attempt to compensate for the dissatisfaction the guest has experienced. this did not happen. we heard nothing more from management and check out the following day. we had arranged to stay on in london another few nights and we would have gladly extended our stay had we been treated properly so we checked into another hotel nearby and had a wonderful stay. my advice is to stay at claridges or the levin. management is competent and reacts to guests needs/preferences. | i would not be able to recommend this hotel to anyone.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''this apex is not as nice as the one at temple court, but good for business district. the rooms are modern and clean and the staff is great! i rated it lower, as the restaurant is just ok and the bar is non-friendly for socializing. it is also located in an alley, so the atmosphere outside is less than desirable.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''great luxurious hotel institution on one of london's best locations. the hotel overall is very nice designed and you can even feel the old glamour of this world famous hotel - in a perfect contemporary way. | we had booked a junior suite with themse view, nevertheless they first showed us a junior suite with a seperate living room. not bad, but the view was more than terrible: i would not recommend to book a junior suite facing the courtyard as this is one of london's worst views. so we showed our ""butler"" the confirmation of the junior suite themse and got the right one after 15 minutes waiting. there was no real apologize. when we finally arrived in our junior suite we were impressed by the view and the interior of the room - to be honest, i saw some larger junior suites! just a sofa added into the room is not worth the title junior suite, although the bathroom was impeccable and stocked with excellent le labo amenities and a huge separate rain shower. | after a while the butler asked us for some welcome drink, so we ordered tea and a coke. the best thing is, that we found it on our bill the next day. it is surprising that these high prices do not even include a small welcome drink. after that the butler left us and we never saw him or any kind of butler again !?! that is not the way a savoy butler service should work! | the spa was old-fashioned and the pool too cold. the changing room with sauna, steam bath and showers was nice with some great aromatherapy associates products. the fitness was also not that bad, just a bit small. | the most disappointing thing during our stay was the breakfast. for about 36 gbp per person, such an offer of continental breakfast is more than unpolite!! of course scrambled eggs are at an additional 8 gbp. | when we wanted to request a late check-out, they told us it would be free of charge until 1 pm. | i stayed at several leading hotels yet and there was never any problem for a late check-out until 2 or 3 pm. there was also nobody taking care when we arrived or left, we had to take our luggage by ourselfs. | when i compare the savoy to the corinthia, where i stayed in february 2012, i have to say that for the same price, the savoy did not fulfill my expectations. the corinthia had a better spa, service was more personal and of course the 24 hours check-in/check-out!'''",1

"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''cigar smoke has been mentioned as an issue, but during our stay we never noticed it upon entering the lobby. we did have a problem with the air conditioning in that it stopped working one night, was repaired and stopped working the following night as well. given the heat in london, and limited window opening due to security locks on windows, ac was required. the team relocated us to a larger room within the same category which we thought was an ""upgrade"" until we saw the room. it was larger but located on a lower floor and adjacent to another building. for this reason a privacy film was fixed to all windows (floor to ceiling, wall to wall ) with the exception of maybe a 12 inch space across the top. so you could not see out the windows. this was unfortunate. the other thing about this room (number 207) is that there is very limited drawer space for clothes storage. we were on a one week holiday and it would have been nice to actually unpack our clothes as opposed to living from a suitcase for the remainder of our stay. there is certainly ample space to include a small chest of drawers and perhaps management should consider this option. for one person on a weekend trip the storage is probably adequate but for for more guests staying longer it is not. when we shared our concerns (no way to see outside, no storage) with the front desk staff they did seem to listen. but unfortunately did not take, in our opinion, appropriate action. in fact some members of the front desk team appeared to avoid eye contact with us and not engage in conversation. in a hotel of this calibre, despite a guest voicing concerns, the staff should be trained to continue to offer the same level of professional and friendly service. this was also unfortunate as the onus was on the guests who were inconvenienced to reach out to the front desk staff. we did eventually speak with the rooms manager who, once he understood the full story, was very understanding and apologetic for our issues. | he regained our confidence in the team and offered a complimentary transfer to the airport as a good-will gesture, this was was much appreciated. concierge staff were amazing, especially david. drivers were also amazing, as were the restaurant staff especially paula. dinner in the jazz club was well worth it and a very relaxed atmosphere. butler service was amazing and wake up calls were followed with a delivery of complimentary coffee/tea if requested. a nice touch. leo the doorman was awesome and tenacious at hailing down a cab on a very busy street!'''",1
The Savoy,"'''having stayed at the ritz, the dorchester and claridges, we eagerly awaited our arrival at the savoy. there is little point going in to detail as life is too short!! though in summary, very disappointing experience. whilst many of the staff were attentive and helpful, others sadly were just not. i found the staff to be exceptionally snobby which i have never felt in the aforementioned hotels. i understand the hotel was fully booked the night we stayed which may have added to everyone is stress, but clearly the hotel could not cope. it cannot be denied, the hotel is fabulously appointed and as a 4 star hotel would have received an excellent' from me, but it is just not in the same category as the aforementioned hotels. | i understand the savoy is owned by the fairmont group. we had already booked to stay at the the fairmont on the palm, dubai in the april. after stopping here though we cancelled it and booked in to the atlantis instead. | were unlikely to be back.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel is a 5 star hotel with a 3 star service. amazing building but it is quite evident that they neither have enough staff nor the caliber of staff to match the category of hotel they are charging for. we spent a weekend there. spending more that $4k usd over two days. on arrival we were given a room that had a major swage issue. on opening the door, the smell hit us hard and filled the corridor with the most awful stink. i only managed to walk in, call the reception and wait in the corridor. after one more call and a a 20 minute wait, they walked up with with a new key, a gave us a much smaller room witch thankfully did not smell. the manager was apologetic, but i insisted on him coming up with me to the room and was asking him, how does something like this would pass the housekeeping, the people who left the fresh fruit there and ..........he did send us a bottle of champagne and a written apology but we had already started on the wrong foot. things were not great in the hotel, the spa never picks up the phone. i tried 6 times directly, called reception and they tried and we all gave up. their suggestion was, i should just go there! the spa was great once we got there and that went a long way to recover the bad hotel service. after we checked out, i realised i left my fitbit in the room. i called them back and they had thankfully found it. i asked them to have it at the concierge and i will return on wednesday to collect it. they confirmed this is what they will do. returned on wednesday, no sign of it and lost and found was closed. concierge took my card and promised that they would call me and send it to me the next day! no calls, yes you guessed it. called today, it is with lost and found and they wanted me to pay for postage (somehow?) and write to them so they can send it back. pathetic service. it all looks very nice, but trust me, the service is really bad in this hotel.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the location for this hotel is excellent, there is a harvey nichols across the road and you can get to hyde park very quickly. the restaurants are great with bar bouloud serving one of the best burgers. however, the rooms need renovation as soon as possible. the air conditioning unit is quite loud. the bathtub's handle keeps falling off whenever you touch it. there are several places that need to be cleaned up such as the ceiling's speaker, doors and windows' hinges . it is an excellent hotel but i do not think it is worth the money.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''stayed for two nights. the hotel was obviously not full and there was some attempt to upgrade your room at check in ( at your own expense of course). check in experience was civilised and the room adequate although the bathroom was very cold for the whole period we were there. there was no attempt to re-fill the mini bar (not even the water), a reminder had to be phoned through - not really what you expect. ate at kaspers restaurant at the hotel on first evening and the food was excellent to be fair, would recommend this restaurant. breakfast was equally good the next morning at a good table overlooking the thames. | there is a propensity for staff to tell you that there is always a waiting time to be allowed into either of the bars but once you make clear that you are a resident we were not kept waiting at all. | the service in the american bar was slow to say the least, we were so unsure as to whether our drinks were ever going to arrive on one occasion that we ordered them twice from different servers. | the second evening was somewhat challenging as there had been some sort of private party in another part of the hotel but as we attempted to get the lift to our room there was a commotion with an obviously drunk person sleeping on the stairs. it appeared that the staff were at something of a loss as to how to handle this, although it must be said that other staff members probably caused it by continuing to serve someone alcohol that was obviously inebriated. by doing this they set up every one of their other guests for a floor show that was not on anyone's agenda. furthermore once we did get to our floor (next floor up) it was obvious that said drunkard had been taken ""short"" all over the floor. after tip toeing our way through that it was reported. | we have stayed here several times before but on consideration would probably pick one of the many other 5 star hotels in london for a future stay.'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''ok, the rooms are hideous, unless you like that sort of thing, they are certainly overpriced, but then it is in the centre of london and they do charge for the internet which really bugs me and they do not include breakfast, but they do assure you that if you have breakfast before 12 noon you will not have to be offended by being asked to sign the bill! (over 30 for an english) | but those carpets do not come cheap and in many ways it is faultless, so why you may wonder did i ask to see the duty manager as i checked out? | well at 1440 on the previous afternoon i had rung down to the grill to ask for a table for lunch. only to be told that they were absolutely full and, in any case, stopped serving at 1500. but, i was assured should things change i would be called straight away! | at 1455 i tired of waiting and trotted down to the grill, which to my surprise was only some 60% full. i spoke to the same woman, she even reminded me that i had just called down (just was stretching a point but in that timeless atmosphere who is arguing about a few minutes here or there) and then without so much as a blush trotted me straight in to the restaurant and sat me down at a table! i gave myself a very good pinch and tried to work out how it was that i was sitting in the very restaurant i had been told only 15 minutes before was full and fully booked! i am using the singular here and it should, of course, be the plural to which i will now change. | time moved on and 1500 came and went and still people arrived, were shown tables and were served food, in fact when i left at about 1615 they were still coming in and were still being served. i wondered out loud to my companion if we would have been left stranded in the room! | as i pointed out to a very apologetic duty manager the next morning, perhaps they just did not need (or was it want) any more customers. which only goes to prove that even in the best places it is easy to lie over a telephone but not so easy face to face! | by the way it was an excellent lunch! | half a bottle of vin ordinaire chablis in the minibar for 40 (plus plus) was too far for even my exhausted amex card! | would i go back? probably, but i would leave my glasses behind'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''having lived in london for nine years in the past, id always assumed that central budget hotels were fleapits. as a result, i was pleasantly surprised at the ridgemount on gower st. whilst it has clearly been there for some years, the staff were unfailingly helpful, and the facilities good. | with a main bus stop virtually opposite, and goodge st station a few minutes walk away, the location is excellent, meaning that you can be in the thick of the west end in minutes. | having made our booking a little later than planned, we had a twin room with shared bathroom (rather than the planned ensuite double), but experienced few problems waiting for the facilities. | the tv reception was woeful, but this was not exactly a priority with so much on the doorstep. our compact room was surprisingly warm at night, so the desktop fan proved very useful. | all up, the ridgemount was great value for money, and wed happily stay there again on a future visit.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''to be honest i was a little disappointed it was my 50 birthday treat but the room did not look anything like the web site suggested. although very clean and spacious. the hotel restaurant was being refurbished and we did not know until arrival. sunday night we had to sit in bar and eat which was fine as its a lovely bar but they were still trying to get restaurant finished for opening next morning so we were listening to banging etc and lots work guys busying about at midnight still. bar staff were disorganised and seemed to be falling out amongst themselves and the food was very average, i asked for a medium rare steak but it was more like a sandwich well done one sadly. they forgot drinks and service were slow, it was all a bit disjointed. did not want to complain as everyone was very preoccupied with what was going on with the refurbishment. reception staff were efficient and friendly and neil in reception was very chatty and helpful. they add a service charge to be bar/restaurant charge when you check out which you can decline and i did because of the lack of efficiency in bar.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we visited the savoy to try the temptation wheel which pairs desserts and cocktails. the thames foyer is beautiful, a perfect setting, it was both a lovely occasion to get dressed up but also a relaxed fun evening. | the desserts are stunning! there is a good selection and the ones we chose were so pretty. the cocktails... it really let the experience down unfortunately. the cocktail i chose, described as 'light, salted caramel and chocolate' was so strong it was unpleasant and i could not have more than one slip. similarly my friend's cocktail was so floral it was not nice, again very strong. | i would say it is worth a visit for the desserts, but instead of paying 16 for, in my opinion, an unpleasant cocktail, i would recommend paying 2 more and enjoy your dessert with a glass of champagne!'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''stayed here for 2 nights with the winter warmer offer. the room was not as grand as we expected from all the glowing reviews. a bit dark and a big table squeezed on one side of the bed which made it quite difficult to move around. there was a function in the courtyard, which is supposed to be so very quiet, and since it was very hot in the room (air conditioning did not work), tried to sleep with open windows but due to the noise from the courtyard, i called reception. was told that this would stop at 10 p.m. and since it was still going on at around 11 p.m. we were eventually moved to a very quiet and more spacious room. if we had stayed in this second room, which was an executive room i believe, we would have rated this hotel as one of the best we have stayed, but with the above-mentioned issues our stay was not as care-free as expected. all staff members (except the invisible 'manager' at reception, who never came to the phone and obviously lied to us about the party ending at 10 p.m.) were perfect, very friendly and helpful, the meals we had in the restaurant were very good and nicely presented, the northhall restaurant is a grand place. breakfast was crowded, not as good as expected, seating too cramped.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this was in celebration for my mother's birthday and gathering with my auntie. | the venue is lovely and cosy, overall we did enjoy the experience as it was a nice gathering for mum and auntie. | the disappointment which we did not expect to experience within a 5 star hotel for a 5 star afternoon tea is that we felt short changed and overcharged for what we received. we ordered the 3 wimbledon afternoon tea sets at the cost of 45pp and when it was served it was not 3 full sets and for most of the cakes it was either one or 2 of each kind (we looked at each other and said, should we be sharing some of these cakes as we did not get one each). i questioned the waitress that there seem to be some cakes missing should we not get one of each cake per person? was not sure if she understood what i mean and then she went away and came back with a few more cakes but still not complete the 3 sets. we felt uncomfortable to ask her again to complete the set because she already brought over 3 more cakes, and it would look like we were being greedy for asking more cakes when we had not even started. the principle of things is that we ordered 3 sets therefore 3 full sets should be served and we should not feel that we are sharing 2 afternoon tea sets between 3 persons and paying for 3! | although we can request for more cakes but it should only be if we want extra not because cakes were missing from our set. therefore, we did not feel satisfied that we did not receive the full set for the full price we paid. consequently have been overcharged. | would advise that if you do go for the afternoon tea and if there is more than one of you, check that you have received the full sets each and should not be the case that you have to share the cakes!'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''exceptionally friendly staff, beautifully designed hotel in general, but the room quality is poor. the tv did not work for the duration of our stay, the air conditioning was terrible, the room was extremely humid, so much so that we did not sleep. this is my third stay and each time there has problems with the room. love tom dixon which is what has always encouraged me to use the hotel, but after our most recent experience i would not return. |'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i would not recommend this hotel to anybody, as soon as we got here we was asked for an extra 100 pound deposit for the mini bar even though we were sure that we would not be touching this! the rooms were very small the best thing about it was the telly. the view out of our window was basically another wall, the only thing that was fairly nice was the bar on the upper level with great views but only if the weather is nice. very expensive and not worth a penny.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''having read several recent good reviews of the savoy, we are wondering if we stayed in the wrong hotel. | my husband and nine year old son and i decided to stay three nights whilst visiting the paralympic games and other various attractions london has to offer. | we arrived before arrival checking time and was greeted out of the taxi by the doorman. unfortnately, as we had arrived early they did ask our names, which in turn was repeated via ear piece to the lady waiting for us inside. our luggage was taken from us, no guided tour was given at the hotel as others have mentioned, just finger pointing on the spot to the various areas. | we were lead into the reception area to check in, as our room was not ready (we did not expect it to be) we said we would collect our paralympic tickets and have a look around london, no problem. we did receive a telephone call whilst out informing us that our room was ready. | upon arrival back to the hotel we were shown up to our room. the room as expected was in the traditional style art deco and lovely black and white bathroom. the view out of the window was facing other rooms, which we were fully aware of when we booked. our bed and pillows as previous comments were heaven. i had forgotten to pack my mobile phone charger and after a telephone call to reception they kindly collected my phone and charged it for me. | however, after this the service we felt went down hill. after returning late to our room the first night, my son mentioned that the mattress was hurting him. after checking this myself i noted that you could feel the mattress springs through the material, it was awful. we made a more comfortable bed for him on the floor and contacted reception the next morning. as they quite rightly pointed out to me, i should of contacted them that evening and not waited until the next morning. i had to agree, that was my fault, after all that is the service you pay for. they said they would bring a replacement mattress and was apologetic. when we arrived back to the room they had changed the mattress and left a voice mail message asking if we were happy with the replacement, i acknowledged this. | however, my husband and i did expect perhaps a little something complementary for my son in the room for the trouble caused. maybe our expectations of this hotel were too high. | we did not eat in the hotel as all three days we have planned events so we had breakfast en route to the events rather than rushing eating the breakfast at the savoy. we had made various bookings for dinner, including the ivy. the one thing we noted was the lack of tea &amp; coffee facilities in the room, just the mini bar and the complementary water on the second night when housekeeping carried out the turn down service, and the complementary morning newspaper. wifi was 10.00 for 24 hours unless a member. | our last day we had housekeeping knock on our door at 8.45am to ask what time we where leaving. we have showered and dressed and had an event booked for that morning so we thought we would check out before the 12pm deadline leaving our luggage at the hotel until our train departed that evening. whether it was to liase back for luggage collection we are not sure. we said we where leaving in half an hour but, no one came to collect the luggage, so we presumed it was housekeeping that wanted to know when to come back to clean the room. | when we arrived back later that afternoon the hotel was very busy with people arriving for afternoon tea. we decided that it would be nice to have a cup of tea and a piece of cake from the savoy tea shop and relax and watch the world go by for an hour or so. we asked the lady if it was possible to have a piece of cake and tea at the empty tables dotted around the foyer, she went off to ask someone and came back and said no it was not possible. | we felt so uncomfortable at the point we collected our luggage and left. we are not people that expect fuss, however, we felt the service was very unwelcoming, perhaps it would of been different if we have stayed longer or booked one of the superior rooms. | we have stayed in many superior hotels, i myself at the waldorf astoria in new york and the service was impeccable. we have also stayed in three star hotels en route to our holiday destinations and we have never been made to feel as we did at the savoy. | the hotel is full of history, and beautiful, but, we shall remember the savoy for the wrong reasons.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''the rooms are ok, and the staff is very nice (especially the lithuanian receptionist and another receptionist by the name of alam). the only thing is that is not in a nice area. by the night, there are a lot of drunk people around and ""bad faces"". however, i would return to this hotel!'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i have waited some time to write this review. i stayed in august 2015 on a sunday nigh package to include dinner. having spent some time reading reviews and checking information on the website i booked a mini suite as a treat for my husbands birthday and because the website indicated you could access a butler, complimentary drink, etc. i double checked by ringing the hotel before booking. i was so excited. on arrival we had to wait in a queue to be checked in, even though i understood suite had in room check in. we were taken to our room, small and not really a suite, to find somone working in the bathroom. we were then offered a free drink in the bar because of the inconvenience. no sooner had we got to the bar than the room was ready, but we still had our complimentary drink. when we got back to the room i noticed that there was not any bottled water, as per the package details so i checked the website again and rang reception. i queried whether i was in a suite, initially told i was not and then told i was. i asked about tea/coffe (supposed to be complimentary) and heat was ordered. eventually i spoke to a manager who told me that the butler, complimentary drink etc were not included in the package. when i read from the website to her, she was also looking at it, she acknowledged that it could be seen as misleading and agreed to honour what was included! she then offered to show me another room. this was much bigger and nicer so we agreed to move. having said someone would come for the luggage and bring a key, we repacked and waited. eventually i rang again asking for the key. this eventually came and we moved ourselves to the new room. having so looked forward to this treat, it had been lessened by the experiences we had. dinner at kaspars was lovely, attentive good food and service. breakfast the next morning was not so good. we ate in the atrium. taking our initial order was slow. there was a long wait for it to arrive, and they then forgot my husbands order. we had to wait for cutlery and milk once we had managed to attract someone is attention. as i sat watching other guests, it was clear the service was not what it should be. i really wanted to be cocooned in the savoy experience, it was a special birthday treat and it was not what it should or could have been. i have experienced much better service in hotels with no stars. it was not a good 24hrs at the savoy and when we asked for an umbrella because it was raining we were told they had all been sold! with sincere regret i would not recommend the savoy.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''travelling to london for the first time with 4 teenaged girls, i was looking for a hotel that was reasonably priced and would accomodate five women in one room. rhodes hotel was one of the very few that would sleep 5 in a reasonable price range. the room was a decent size, especially considering it had a double bed, a single bed and a set of bunk beds in it. there was a mid-sized armoire and desk, as well as a refridgerator and coffee maker. the bathroom was quite small, and rather old, but clean. there was not much room for the large amount of luggage we had, but we made do. we travelled in august and it was warm, but at night we would put the air on and the room would cool off within a reasonable amount of time. there was a bit of street noise in the early night, but it was generally quiet thoughout the night. we were on the third floor and there were alot of stairs and no elevator, but honestly, we were not in the room much so we avoided extra trips by thinking ahead. the breakfast room was in the basement, so it was a bit of a hike up and down in the morning to breakfast, but the food was very good and the owner made for interesting conversation. there was also a computer available for guests next to the breakfast room which was a nice bonus. | the owners were very helpful and watchful. maria offered alot of suggestions on buses and tube routes, as well as general info on nice places to visit. we travelled to london 4 weeks after the first tube bombing in july of 2005, so safety was a big concern for us, but the hotel itself offered a nice safe atmosphere. the neighborhood also seemed safe, any crime in the area may have been attributed to all the police being on the subway. the tubes were very well guarded, and while i had originally thought of avoiding them, we ended up riding them every day and we felt quite safe. while i would not say this was a fancy hotel, it was decent and it did house the five of us at a reasonable rate.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''staff were very friendly and helpful. property is very clean. there is no elevator and there are 6 floors. however, not worth 149 pounds per night. breakfast was adequate, but could not say it was good. felt like the griswalds. bathroom was in a closet. not rec for an extended stay in london'''",1
Newham Hotel,'''i am suprised at reading these terrible reviews !!! i thought our room was clean and fairly new looking. bathroom was ok too. we only stayed for one night whilst we attended love box festival but it served its purpose(comfortable sleep &amp; breakfast). staff seemed friendley. for the money and what we wanted it for it was fine !!!''',1
The Rembrandt,"'''we arrived in london after docking in dover. we had been on a crystal cruise on the symphony. we were originally a bit disappointed at the sight greeting us. the front entrance was being redone and we were concerned that there would be further work going on inside. that did not prove to be the case. our rooms were not ready, we had booked two. the front desk people seemed to be confused as one told us they were ready, another said they were not. we should go to lunch and they would contact us when the rooms were available. so we did just that and sure enough a text came through that said we could check in. back to the hotel. no, that was an error. the rooms still were not available. we walked around for a bit and finally when we returned, we were able to get into our rooms. ours was quite large, with three big windows that actually opened. but we could not open them as they were right next to some type of generators and the smell was awful. so, no fresh air and no view. but that is not what we came to london for anyway so we decided it was not a big deal. our friends changed their room because the mattress squeaked so loudly even when they sat on it that they knew they would not get any sleep. i know, so far this sounds bad, but trust me, we enjoyed our stay. the lobby is very nondescript, almost stark and shabby. but if you go up a few stairs to the glass double doors and go inside there is a lovely seating area with a bar. this is also where breakfast was served and it was always very good with lots of typical choices. the only thing missing was eggs cooked to order. the wait staff was efficient and pleasant. while on this trip i developed a nasty bacterial infection which kept me from going out and about as much as i would have liked to. so a lot of my time was spent in the sitting room where i had lunch, read a book, enjoyed a glass of wine, or eavesdropped on conversations around me. nosy, i know. our bed was not squeaky and was very comfortable. the room is equipped with a cute little beverage compartment for making tea, coffee or hot chocolate. also a stocked refrigerator and the bottled water was free! also free wifi, a must these days. we stayed 4 nights, only had cookies in our beverage compartment for one day. the maid did not get as big a tip as she would have gotten if we had cookies every morning! also if we had not had to sneak into the hallway and snatch a roll of toilet tissue off the maids cart. they were a bit stingy with kleenex and toilet tissue. the bathroom was large with a whirlpool tub which i could not figure out how to use. the amenities were very nice, everything was neat as a pin. if you are short, like me, or not as agile as you used to be,(unfortunately, also like me) the tub is very difficult to get in and out of to take a shower. it is very high off the ground so keep that in mind and hang on to something tightly on your way in and out. we liked the location. it is about 3 blocks from the tube station, right across the street is the victoria and albert museum and about one block further is the natural history museum. there are plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants in walking distance and it is easy to get a taxi or hop on a bus. this was not the nicest hotel we have stayed in, but it suited our purposes. i would have to say that the biggest disappointment was the staff at the front desk. very busy, busy, busy on the phone, while lines of actual, living people are waiting to check in or ask a question. probably understaffed.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''the lobby area and bar/restaurant are vast and mood lighting everywhere..very stylish. rooms however felt a bit industrial with quirky attempts at modern art that did not really work for me. mini bar extortionate but probably comparable to most 5 star hotels...location ok on the river but if you are looking for a central location i think there are better alternatives. very expensive for the room also. check out was very slow but this was a thursday when most business commuters are leaving. | would i stay there again?? probably not''',1
The Savoy,"'''the savoy is in a great location and first impression when you walk through the door is of seclusion and exclusivity. however because of its central location the rooms, while decorated tastefully are a little on the small size for 5-star luxury. the breakfast is amazing though and the hotel really is beautifully decorated but they were booked out weeks in advance for afternoon tea and you could not simply walk down to the lounging room and have a coffee or tea in the afternoon without a booking which was disappointing. also, the noise levels, which cannot be helped given its location, disrupted sleep somewhat. however, the staff are wonderful and it is an experience but i do not know if i will return.'''",1
The Savoy,'''some time ago under the old management access to the american bar was evening dress. last night the fairmont have reached a new pinnacle by allowing shorts and flip flops. if you are celebrating a special occasion perhaps it is better to give this venue a miss. the very high prices and decor should give you a sense of occasion but the hotel devalues it with a 'any' dress code!''',1
The Savoy,"'''i have heard of this hotel for years and finally go to stay here. the building remolded multiple time is beautiful. the service and food quality,not so hot! | first we checked in and were told our room was not ready. it would take about 2 hours. 2 cups of coffee and lunch i finally went to ask. it had been 4 hours. if i had not asked, how long would we have waited? | second, i contacted the concierge for dinner reservations. we talked and he was going to call me back. never happened. | today, it took nearly 40 minutes to get our breakfast served. very disappointed.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''fabulous location, nice interior, great bars, decent gym, staff generally energetic and friendly. | rooms a little small, beds a little hard, breakfast not offered, mould on bathroom beading, one security staff officious, unhelpful and a little arrogant. | on balance, a good stay - would stay again. | in the absence of an affordable breakfast, waitrose is around the corner to the south of the hotel, near blackfriars bridge.'''",1
The Savoy,'''disappointed to have a river view suite on the 4th floor where you cannot see the river due to the tress (as beautiful as they are). room should be discounted during summer months when trees are full. complained to the hotel and there was only downgrades available with a river view.''',1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''nice place but it cannot really wear the title ""hotel"". it is a nice b&amp;b but not really more than that. | we booked a double room with a private bathroom and the place has many rooms with shared bathroom. the price difference is huge but i do not really get who would want to use a shared bathroom on a vacation. the room we got was very small which is ok although it is the bed and the luggage and no more space left. | what really bugged me is that except a very small tv there is nothing else in the room. no fridge no safe and no hot water kettle which i find all 3 of them essential for a place calls itself a hotel. also the bed was terrible. the mattress was absolutely beaten, lumpy and squeaky. my back did not enjoy it at all. | there is a coffee/tea machine downstairs but it really bad. also there is aside machine for 50p. both of them in a lounge which is quite small and no inviting when crowded. they do have 2 pc station for guest use which is good. | it do has some good features. the best of them is the location (which is why we chose it). 5 minutes walking from the british museum and 3 tube stations on 2 lines and 1 overground (euston) that will easily take you anywhere and one of them on the piccadilly line that will take you straight to and from heathrow without the need to change trains. | the rooms and toilets are kept very clean. | also the breakfast is good. it in the basement and becomes quite crowded towards 9am but the great staff will help you fond a place quickly. | the manager is also very helpful to find anything you need. hangouts, restaurants and laundry service if you need it. use him he is very nice. | bottom line, i am definitely not saying do not go there but do set your expectations straight when you booking this ""hotel"".'''",1
The Savoy,"'''lovely hotel , friendly easy check in . | we had a dinner bed and breakfast package, we had dinner in simpsons on the strand included which was nice but it was quite noticeable the staff were far more interested in the paying customers off the street than people with vouchers or packages like us. the food was ok , but not great , a lovely venue with a big open fireplace and a amazing surround only to be spoiled by puting a table right next to it so cannot use, i can only imagine this is to bring more money in but really spoils it, i would not recommend to friends which is a shame as would be so easy to make lovely with few touches. | we stayed on 8th floor in a standard room, which was spacious with original character but in need of a bit tlc ie new light bulbs as some were out, tile falling off wall in bathroom, shower screen loose and also needed cleaning more as was stains next to toilet running down wall gross, i did mention this when we got there but they did not send anyone till we were leaving room next day, the maids took our champagne out the bucket and put in the bin even though it still had couple glasses in it they cleared the bucket and glasses whilst we were at breakfast but left everything else in the room very strange coming in just for bucket and glass i guess there was someone more important that needed it. however they did send up a couple of fresh glasses of champagne as a apology which was nice of them. all these things really spoiled our anniversary and i would not recommend this hotel , they also tried to over charge me only a little amount but really not good enough for such a established hotel very upsetting all in all.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''so a five star hotel...hmmmm. nope | door staff are helpful but their attire is as casual as could be. i am not kidding i thought it was a scammer trying to steal my bag. | the room was 'okay'. nothing more than a normal chain hotel. they will try to up sell you to superior room or a river view. and it are not cheap. | location is brilliant. | bar is extortionate | overall under impressed and over priced.''',1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",'''i have read the less complimentary reviews and i think they are a bit harsh. our room faced the sun so was bright and airy. the bathroom was bright and spotless. yes the reviewer mentioned cream carpets not a good idea. yes our room was very small if we were there for a long time or had travelled long haul there would be no room for large suitcases. the small classic rooms are only suitable for a couple of days. i do think it was a bit pricey for such a small room. no iron too which was a surprise. the hotel staff were extremely nice and eager to please. the hotel bar and foyer modern and funky. one problem was solved immediately which was the kettle boiled over spilling water everywhere we tried less water but still boiled leaving lid open solved the problem until replacement was brought. sink plug did close so shaved in running water. we are quite laid back people so it was all not such a big deal however i have never stayed in such a small room so unless we get a good deal for a larger room cannot see us going back which is a shame''',1

(so dbl bed took up five feet, leaving only 3 feet of space, which also had to hold our suitcases.) noise from street was loud, but then this is london, and that is what you need to expect. | breakfast was an extra flight of stairs in to the basement, also very narrow. | place is very clean! so even if the carpet might be torn in places, and the narrow stairs tilted a little, they were all immaculate. sheets of a nice quality. | breakfast served by a couple who were older and english, supported by a team of younger people who seemed polish. service was good, except for the english tend to still cover their mouth with their hands when they sneeze, and then they pick up your plate and hand it to you, with the same hand they used to cover their mouth. they need to be taught to sneeze in to their arm, and not to use hands as kleenexes. breakfast was a full english breakfast every day, and was included, when some hotels charge extra for anything beyond toast. breakfast food seemed to be re-heated, and not always cooked fresh. | i would reccomend this hotel for a person who does not want to stay in a hostel, but can not afford a nicer hotel. would be excellent for a group on a school trip, and assign the teachers and chaperones the rooms that are en suite, and allow the kids to use the rooms with shared hallway facilities.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i stayed for a single night recently, costing 85 including breakfast. you cannot really argue with what it offers for the price. | i stayed for easy access to the heathrow express train and jumped on the 05:10 train first thing in the morning so cannot comment on breakfast. paddington station is just over 5 mins away. | room (single) turned out to be a triple with a sofa, so had plenty of room. bathroom is small, but for this price lots of places do not even offer en-suites. the hallways are a bit ""student halls"", and the rooms are not exactly plush - but again, you would not expect them to be. | free wifi, tea facilities in room and you can borrow an ironing board. large tv in the room as well. | close to transport links at paddington.'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''my wife and i stay regularly at london hotels and have stayed several times at the dorchester in the past, although recently we have preferred both claridges and the savoy. anyway we got a good deal on a 3 night stay in an executive deluxe king which promised, according to the hotel's own publicity, mayfair or hyde park views and a walk-in shower. however, on arrival my wife was shown to a room (240) with a view of air-conditioning units and a shower perched over the bath. the room also contained a hand-written note welcoming somebody else to their stay at the dorchester. he presumably had not wanted room 240 either. | a complaint to reception resulted in an immediate transfer to a lovely room (209) overlooking park lane and with a walk-in shower. | breakfast the first day took one hour and 10 minutes to have one bowl of porridge (requested cream missing), two poached eggs on toast, and a cooked english breakfast (requested mushrooms missing). we were asked four times if we wanted a bakery basket by various staff, presumably because they took pity on us sitting there with no food although there was an apology for the long delay. | we had had breakfast the first day in the newly refurbished grill room (which is a major improvement on its dingy predecessor), so on the second morning when asked whether we wanted to have breakfast in the grill room or promenade opted for the promenade only to be told there were no tables available there(why were we asked?). when asked how long a table might be the answer, believe it or not, was a terse ""when somebody leaves"". even allowing for the fact something may get lost in the translation with the almost exclusively foreign staff, and accepting that i might have been in a very slightly grumpy mood, i am afraid this was too much for me. despite being on a breakfast inclusive rate i went out for breakfast - my wife stayed without me and reported no problems with her day two breakfast. | hopefully tomorrow's breakfast will work for both of us!'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i took my mother for afternoon tea as a christmas treat. the service as a whole was very good, but it was the superior attitude of one member of staff that let the whole experience down and it was that abiding memory that will ensure they will not be getting our custom again. to make matters worse, i even e mailed with my complaint, which was acknowledged and passed on to the relevant manager in the thames foyer. as of today, (6 days later) i have received no response which i find breathtakingly arrogant! you may be one of the leading ""luxury"" hotels in the capital, but with the poor approach to guest recovery and particularly given the current financial climate, your customers will start voting with their feet, and will go to a hotel that treats them with a little more respect and a little less ""attitude""'''",1

The Rembrandt,'''this hotel is across the street from the museum and close to kensington palace and harrods. i only stayed one night so i did not get to go to the museum or see the whole neighborhood but how can you go wrong in knightsbridge/south kensington. the room was okay but i agree with the other reviewers that the breakfast is not that good. i enjoyed the kensington palace tour and the gardens are beautiful.''',1
The Rembrandt,"'''had a really enjoyable five day stay here in may of this year with my husband - great location, friendly and helpful staff, pleasant and well appointed room. on the back of this, a friend and i stayed for one night in a twin first floor room on saturday 21 september. we were allowed to check in early, which we appreciated. when we got to our room, there was a note informing us that the restaurant would be closed that night due to a private function where there would be musical entertainment and an apology was made in advance for any inconvenience. we naively took this to mean the inconvenience of not being able to use the restaurant that night. when we returned to our room at 11.30pm, we discovered that we were directly above the function room where a party was in full swing with bass heavy dance music being blasted out at an unacceptably loud level. we telephoned reception to complain four times. at every call, we were assured that the party would be ending very shortly and our requests for an alternative room evaded. during the third call we insisted on speaking to the duty manager, as although the volume had been reduced for 10 minutes, it was now louder than ever. we were informed that the duty manager was not there that night and the acting duty manager eventually called us back. he admitted that several complants had been made that night as some people had early flights to catch in the morning. the music stopped abruptly an hour and a quarter after our first call; i can only assume a guest/guests complained in person. | when we were in line to check out, the receptionist asked every guest before us if they had had a pleasant stay, but refrained from asking us the same question - had she been tipped off?! | we cannot understand why these rooms were let to guests not attending the party. a shame as we had such a positive impression of the hotel previously.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''location: excellent location right off strand, minutes from covent gardens. tube stations nearby *****; | hotel: i understand the hotel underwent an extreme makeover and it shows in the public areas *****; | staff: most of the staff was very friendly but lots of security and they give you the once over when you enter. **** | service: varied from excellent to poor. for example one day we had water glasses in our room, the next day none. dirty dishes were left after cleaning. i called for our luggage to be picked up and it took 30 minutes for the porter to arrive and deliver to the taxi making the drive to the airport a rush. this is in my opinion inexcusable for a 5 star hotel **1/2; | room: nice but average. our room showed sign of wear and tear. the carpet was coming away at a doorway. you could not plug in a hair dryer in the small bathroom as there was only an electrical shaver plug. no desk level electrical plugs for computers etc. average furnishing. coffee maker was on request only (there was no place to put it - we had it purched on the dresser in front of the television) as was a stand for a suitcase. we had a river view room but the window was small and there was a chair and floor lamp in front making viewing impossible ***; | savoy grill: we tried to get a reservation for saturday night. restaurant told us they were fully booked. advised we were guests of the hotel, reply: we are an independent restaurant, sorry eat elsewhere. after that treatment we did not try to eat there on another night. the other restaurant in the hotel was pricy as in most other hotels; | internet: wifi throughout hotel, no charge for fairmont gold members. | summary: a hotel with a great history. management needs to improve service and maintenance on rooms. no fairmont branding anywhere. a lot of the little extras that make a hotel great seemed to missing. the hotel seemed to be run by a big corporation rather than a hotelier ***'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''my husband and i stayed here for a week in september 2015. the hotel obviously has several different levels of accommodation. our room was adequate for sure. the bathroom was fantastic and always kept clean. our room faced air conditioning units and i believe fire escapes to other apartments. it was however very quiet. i found the ""matre d"" for lack of a better term in the breakfast room to be a bit pretentious. you could see some favouritism to the obviously wealthy clientele. regardless you have to be away that even thought he breakfast buffet appears open to all if you are on a ""continental"" which i did not realize you are only entitled to bread, cereals and cheese. if you want the rest if's an extra 5 pounds per person. this we did not realize until i was advised of this on day 3 by this person. his attitude i found pretentious. the other servers were quite pleasant. the concierge was great in getting us a vehicle to return to the airport. all this being said. it is across from the victoria and albert but if you want to do the tourist thing like we did perhaps a bit closer to the centre is better. catering more to the tourist trade. i felt this hotel again although pleasant and clean catered more to the business person. .'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''a beautiful hotel, with impeccable decor and brilliant service, but unfortunately all of this was eclipsed by how ripped off we felt! we booked an executive room for 700, arrived and it was really quite a small room in comparison for what you can get elsewhere for that money. horrified to find out that breakfast was not included in that rate! i have never heard of this before and i have stayed in several similiar hotels. breakfast came in at 35 a head and for that it was either continental or english, not the choice of both. a film from the tv was 19, the same price as the cinema! just a real shame.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i booked the hotel on the basis of glowing tripadvisor reviews which on reflection may for once have been a little rose tinted! the hotel is perfectly situated close to 3 tube stations and 10 or 15 minutes from just about any attraction you care to mention. it is also very cheap, i paid 55 for a midweek night including vat and breakfast. the owners and staff are very friendly and keen to accomodate. the room was the smallest i have ever stayed in and the bed the narrowest i have ever slept in but it was all clean and functional. the overall impression of the hotel is tired. there is no telephone in the rooms and only the most basic tv and the hotel is very close to ucl and there was quite a lot of street noise. for 1 night in london it did the trick. if you want very very basic at low cost with absolutely no frills then for the money it is fine. what you get is a fair reflection of what you pay.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''stayed at the dorchester on 31st october for 2 nights with my husband and 2 yr old daughter and i will make it brief.the room was gorgeous really classy and old style decorated but super massive marble bathrooms, with excellent floris toiletries, although we had a few niggles with the room the sound system did not work very well and was too loud so you also could not turn it down so you had to leave it switched off, so told the front desk a few times and it took them 3 hrs before anyone appered to fix it, although they did not they just switched the speakers off so we only had sound from the tv and not the sound in the bathroom and our lobby? | the promenade is lovely and spotless with loads of staff but very slow in parts and it sometimes was very hard to get a table here as lots of people not booked into the hotel would while there afternoons here at the promenade which was a problem for us as if we wanted a drink to celebrate our 10yrs wedding anniversary we had to try for a table here as our daughter was not allowed in the bar. also at breakfast although very nice was slow and had to ask about 4-5 people and wait around 20 mins before we would get a highchair? | during our stay here our daughter hurt her arm and was screaming in pain with it but they said they could not help so i had to get a taxi there and back to a chemist somewhere in london on saturady night just to get calpol childrens paracetamol they said they could not get this for me? | overall the hotel is good but the service is not great at all, well not 5 stars anyway andit is also a little impersonal i think if they can sort out some of the niggles then they would truly be deserving of there 5 stars but when you pay 300 pounds + a night you expect a lot more than this. | i would try somewhere else next time, and having stayed at the chesterfield and the milestone these hotels were far better in service standards so the dorchester could learn from these hotels!!!'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we spent all afternoon waiting to check in. | we arrived from paris with a large group on a tour. they arranged a reception room for our check in which included champagne and fiinger food. all very nice except they had trouble finding a room for four of us. amazing considering the trip had been booked months in advance. we had to go to afternoon tea with out being able to freshen up. spoilt the whole occassion which was a hightlight of our tour. on top of that family had arranged to visit me and i could not spend time with them due to waiting around for check in. | they obviously have problems with checking in large groups. no problems at all at the plaza, new york, westin europa &amp; regina, venice, hotel le bristol,, paris les crayeres chateau, reims.'''",1
The Savoy,'''took my wife for her 30 birthday as a special treat but i found the savoy to be anything but special. having stayed at other various 5 star hotels in london we had high expectations of the savoy. we stayed in a one bedroom suite. the carpets looked like they had been layed around 30 years ago by blind men. the toilet did not want to flush. the bed was small and as soft as a marshmellow and dipped in the centre. we both had back pain in the morning. the bath and a chip in the middle. the room needs fully refurbishing. we had dinner in the thames foyer at around 9. the restaurant was very quite but while the staff were friendly they was very slow. we did not recieve the attention we thought we would considering the place was empty and costly. overall the staff were helpful but i left this hotel wishing i had gone somewhere else.''',1
Ridgemount Hotel,'''had a family room on top floor with no lift. very basic. small double bed and two singles all in one room with small ensure. 150 including breakfast which was basic. staff very friendly allowed us to leave bags next day. 5 minutes walk to tube or bus.''',1
The Savoy,"'''we stayed at the savoy from november 26 to 29 and were not particularly impressed. check-in was efficient. while the public spaces in the hotel are beautiful, we were escorted to our room and were very disappointed. although our reservation specified a room upgrade based on availability, they claimed there was nothing available. the room was fairly small and not as posh as we had expected given the cost per night. in fact, it was downright tired-looking. the bathroom was nice but always chilly. the bedroom was tired-looking and faced a construction site with partial view of the river. the noise from the shower in the room next door was intrusive. breakfast was included in our rate and was, perhaps, the highlight of the stay both in terms of service and quality of food. dinner at kasper's was fair; pricey for what it was. we had barely finished our plates before the dishes were whisked away. it definitely seemed they were anxious for us to finish so they could serve the next group of diners. | on our last night at the hotel, a group of people walking down the hall from the elevator was so loud they must have awakened the entire floor. | we would definitely not reserve here again. there are far better places to stay in this price range.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''one night stay in a deluxe twin room (415) despite its location there was minimal traffic noise. | stylish and comfortable reception room, hotel opened a couple of weeks ago and as expected spotlessly clean. | bathroom or rather shower room was tiny, it was not possible to walk into it without either straddling the wc or standing in the shower. towels were large, white and fluffy with l'occtaine products provided. bed was comfortable although duvet quite thick for time of year with two polyester pillow which were not great. no semi skimmed milk at the hotel for my evening drink. tablet only worked intermittently. | discussion with management regarding the room size/facility against cost paid which garnered an acknowledgment that the bathroom was not ideal and an offer of an alternative room which, in my option was no better (or worse) than the original from allocated. | for the price paid we were very disappointed and did not feel enveloped in the generous and supremely comfortable space advertised on the hotels website.'''",1
The Savoy,'''rooms near elevator very noisy. front desk. do not honor amex upgrade. you need to be aggressive and ask for manager-not what i expected to do at a fairmont hotel. great location. the staff will not let you take a drink or ice cream to room. you must sit in bar/rest or call room service. never had that at fairmont plaza in nyc. or any four seasons or ritz i have stayed in.''',1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''rhodes is located in a great place, close to the very heart of london. tube is few minutes walk away, as well as many busses. nice and polite staff, and extra plus for the owner: he is great! helpful and very nice person with whom you can also have a very nice chat. | i was though little surprised by the hype that rhodes have received in here. i was, unfortunately, not lucky enough to be located in one of the renovated rooms. my room was very basic: bed, plasma, closet. it was a bit warned, so i understand why they are renovating the rooms. basic bathroom (though sink was very little), clean. water pressure could be a little better, also had some trouble with hot/cold water. noise from the street can be heard, could be a problem for someone. this time it did not disturb me this much as i only came deadly tired to the hotel to get few hours of sleep. hairdryer caused me trouble as it did not work properly. | breakfast was, as described, good. nice variety, i think everyone is going to find something for themselves, + eggs on request included in the continental breakfast. warm, tasty and fresh! | overall, nice place (especially if you get lucky to be in the renovated room), but i think it is a bit overrated.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''before i start can i just say it not about the money that i am writing this it is about principle | as anyone that has stayed at the dorchester will know it is a beautiful hotel and the location is very good, but why do i have to pay 4 delivery service for a room service cheese burger when they are charging me 26 for it already?? | and then they want to charge me 19-50 a day for wifi which i can get in starbucks or mcdonalds for free oh and there is another 12.5% added as "" discretionary "" for everything you get | other than the penny pinching what they should do is put an extra amount on the cost of the stay then make you feel better by saying all these things are complimentary anyway that is just my point of view.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the staff is super friendly and the location is pretty good. i think the quality of the rooms lined up with the cost, so do not expect too much, but it was fine. the only thing i did not like was that my room was on the top floor of the annex building and there is no elevator. i wish i had booked at the beginning of my three week trip instead of at the end because by then i was exhausted and it made it less convenient to go in and out at will.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed two nights at this hotel. nothing can beat the location. easy to get to and also get around central london. harrods and the metro is few hundred metres away. | reception - staff were ok, no smiles but efficient. there was a portuguese lady at the desk who was very nice - i cannot remember her name. | room - room on the 4th floor close to the fire exit. needs an update. pretty average for the price but i suppose that is how it is in central london. wifi was also weak which was a bit annoying.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''location is excellent, super convenient. the hotel is contemporary and very clean. the room was comfortable and relatively large. the bathroom was spacious also. however, they only gave us 2 towels. the staff was adequate. the rating is 5 star i believe. however, the customer is not led to feel in anyway special here. you certainly feel anonymous. no turn down service. there is a lot of activity at the hotel and a beautiful rooftop bar upstairs. nothing that would particularly compel you to return, apart from if they are offering reasonable rates.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''i stayed in this hotel for 4 nighst during the easter holidays (16.4.-20.4.) with my mom, bro and his girlfriend. first of all, after our arrival to the stratford station, we could not find our hotel because none knew where the number 349 is. it is far away from the city center and we did not even have a map of this area so we spent two hours looking for this hotel. you always nee to take a bus to the stratford station and from there a tube to the city center so you spend a lot of money just for travlling. the room was quite clea and small but we just needed a place to sleep, to have a shover and breakfast in the morning. the mattress was terrible-when the person next to you moves you feel like it is an earthquake but it was quiet and you can sleep well. the bathroom was ok, the shower door did not close properly, so it looked like small floods there. also there was just one towel for a person and the ventilator blows half an hour more after you switched it off. the corridor smelled weird and looked a bit dirty. everyday the breakfast if the same - typical english breakfast:sausages, beans, eggs. there was some fruit, bread but you have to wait a reaaly long time for the bread and eggs. wifi was without problems. | i think that this hotel was fine/avarage but anyway i think it could be a bit cheaper. i recommend this place if you look for somewhere to sleep and to have a shower.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''a beautifully-designed hotel, which is very impressive on entry. the reception area, and restaurant/bar area are all very well presented and make a great first impression. then the queuing begins... i think we stayed on a rather busy weekend, but even so, waiting to check in for 10 minutes kind of puts a dampner on the originally very impressive entrance. the room was perfectly nice, well decorated and comfy bed, the bathroom was compact. the view was rather un-inspiring of some buildings close up, but we could just about see the london eye. we had pre-drinks in the bar before we left which were yummy. | then came breakfast, which we were really disappointed with. we were taken to our table, which was still being cleaned from the previous people who sat here. it took so long to be offered tea or coffee, and milk(!). we then got up and chose some bits from the buffet, only to come back to the waiter giving our table to another couple!! my boyfriend had to explain we would already been given this table! we sat back down, and low and behold i was missing a spoon. it took so long to ever get the waiters attention for things like cutlery, or salt and pepper, that everything starts getting cold (drinks and food). in one word it was manic, which is the complete opposite of what everyone want's a sunday morning breakfast to be. we were really disappointed, and after waiting 10 minutes once again to check out, i let the receptionist know about our breakfast experience, and she apologised and said they were extremely busy. i am sorry, but you being extremely busy should in no way affect the quality of my stay? over all, funky exterior, good location for certain attractions, but the running of this hotel needs addressing...'''",1
The Savoy,"'''my girlfriend and i travel worldwide on business and on vacation and have stayed in good hotels on every continent. we chose to stay at the savoy for a theatre night out in london's west end we were hoping for that something special. the booking experience was good and we were asked if there was anything in particular we wanted from our room. we asked only for a room with a nice view. on arrival the car valet service was prompt and engaging. a good start. entering the lobby there was no clear direction. many staff milling about but none prepared to engage and assist. maybe they have a problem with tourists just walking in from the street? but we had bags ready to check in so we should not have been mistaken. once we found someone we were kindly shown our room and a polite and private check-in was conducted in the room. it was dark so the room had been turned down with the curtains drawn. the room itself was a good standard but nothing special. certainly no more than the equivalent of any of the good hotels in dubai, asia or in the usa. other london hotels offer a much more characterful and high class experience. after an evening at the theatre we returned to the savoy beaufort cocktail bar for a drink. as we approached the ""bouncer"" guarding the bar entrance did not engage and when we we said we would like to go in said we would have to wait outside. we were not offered a drink. when we took out our room card suddenly there was a table and we were ushered in and seated. no-one had left during this period!! the cocktails were great and lived up to their reputation and we were given the recipes as well. when we asked for the bill we were told it had already been applied to our room. we left a good cash tip for the staff there. unfortunately on check out the following morning we found that the hotel had also kindly added on their own 15% service charge for the bar service!! in the morning we opened the curtains to be greeted by the pleasant view of a brick wall. disappointing. on check out we had to debate the presence of other charges for the restaurant that we had not visited. they had also conveniently forgotten the 100 gift voucher that we had presented on check in. all in all we were left with the impression of a good high class hotel, with ordinary rooms, staffed predominantly by foreign workers, adept at ensuring the highest bill possible on check out (ours was over 700 for one night and some cocktails), and not able to deliver the special something that sort of money could buy at hundreds of venues elsewhere and many within a mile of the savoy! we will be searching for that special experience somewhere else next time.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we stayed here on a 1 night spa break and were left disappointed by the way we were treated in the bar. on returning from a gorgeous dinner we decided to have a nightcap. on arrival we were asked if we would like to sit at the bar or on a lounging sofa. we opted for bar but were then very gruffly told there were not any seats! astonishing really given that we had just been offered them. then to add insult to injury we were taken to share a tiny table with another couple. not really the sort of service you would expect at this sort of hotel, the member of staff was totally rude and we observed this rudeness on other guests too. i would not go back. | spa was divine though and rest of staff helpful so a shame really but there are plenty of other hotels.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''my husband and i stayed here for three days in may in an executive room. we checked in after 5 pm and the receptionist had to call housekeeping to see if our room was ready. it was and she handed us a key and directed us to take the elevator down a floor, to the basement. granted the rooms down there have windows but i do not book through the hotel and pay full price to stay half below street level in london. | we returned to the lobby and were given a room on the third floor. room was lovely but tiny. the executive rooms are larger but are also accommodating a larger bed so there is not much floor space. neither executive room had a sofa (or space for one) per the hotel's website description of the room. | the hotel also advertises on its website that executive and deluxe room guests get ""access to the lounge serving complimentary light refreshments between 5pm and 7pm daily."" this was not told to us at reception and when we went to investigate, did not exist. | my husband and i chose to go to the lounge and buy our own drinks only to find that the wine i wanted was not recommended by the bartender and the next two i chose were not yet in stock. my husband got a gin and tonic that was served with flat tonic; he took it back and the bartender made him a fresh one opening a new bottle of tonic that was still half flat. | service is also spotty. we got turn down service two out of our three nights and one day housekeeping took all of our towels but did not replace them so we had to phone down to reception after dinner to ask for towels. we also had to ask for fresh toiletries on day three since they were never refreshed and while the l'occitane products are lovely, the bottles are small and should be refreshed daily. | could be a nice hotel over time but at the moment, i would not pay anywhere near full price to stay here.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we reserved this hotel because of the low price per night and it is location. the neighborhood is very friendly and safe and clean. the hotel staff are very sweet, and the location is very good (only a 5 minute walk to the goodge street tube station). i have read many reviews in various publications &amp; websites about this hotel, and how people love it &amp; come back year after year. with that said, i am not so sure i would stay here again. our room had shared toilet and shower facilities, and we were a little let down with the cleanliness and functioning of them. the shower on our floor took a very long time to get hot water, and the toilet did not always flush properly. if we had toilet &amp; shower facilities in our room we may have felt differently, i suppose. i am not suggesting you do not stay here, just be prepared to wait for hot water in the shower. definitely get a room with private toilet and shower facilities en suite. overall i would say this hotel is 'ok' at best.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i am a 59 year old man on my second visit; i need a hip replacement and therefore have an obvious limp. we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and decided to finish in the dandelyan bar after 3 to 4 drinks elsewhere. a doorman refused me entry saying "" i had too much to drink "", he embarrassed me a hell of a lot. another doorman let us in after i told him i was a resident. groups of people already in the bar had a lot more to drink than us, we had 1 drink and left due to our treatment. the hotel had given us complimentary cocktails but we did not use them as we would not use the bar facility again after the embarrassment we encountered. the general staff failed to acknowledge/notice you and often stepped right in front of you without a word or an excuse me. staff training in customer relations let it down the cooked breakfast was poor the other breakfast items where very nice. this hotel could be really good if the issues of staff/customer relations was dealt with.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the mondrian is chic, friendly and modern, though pretentious and so some will see it as both over-priced and over-rated. it is a great location on the river and a pleasure to have a leisurely breakfast looking over the water to st paul's. public areas are spacious, corridors are dark, and as is often the case in london, standard bedrooms are small. they are decorated in modern style with some flourishes such as artwork that you will either find interesting or truly awful - livery bordering modern airport style. beds are comfortable but you may get a view over a building site. bathrooms have a nice walk-in shower but the water pressure was a bit dribbly. the tube is 6-7 minutes' walk away.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''arrived at hotel - reception area etc impressive with model ships etc. the service was a little over familiar for my liking but some may like the really friendly matey type service. bit embarrassing as the receptionist said he would do what he could for us for an upgrade, found one, offered it to us, we said great thanks ! only then for him to say that will be 35 on top. could not really say no so just went with it. (i stay in hotels a lot and never paid for an offered upgrade ever). | room looked like the one i had booked on the website, think the upgrade was a view which was hugely distorted by the building in front - could just see the top of london eye and river. room was immaculate and very modern however, just not especially big. | had drinks in both the bottom bar (on the river) which had a lovely view, nice feel to the bar (was busy but still relaxed for a saturday night) and great service from the bar tender. | we then moved upstairs to the top bar and it was a different story. it was like it was in a different building all together, really unfriendly, grumpy and rude service. the bar was really busy with non hotel residents, which i get as its a great view, but it is just annoying when you have spent a lot of money to stay somewhere. | breakfast was chaotic - stood around for ages before being seated, were seated, left, after a while someone came over and asked if it had been explained how it worked etc which we had not. selection ok but have had much better. hot self service which i am not keen on, especially in 5*. eventually got a coffee but could not get anyone's attention for a second cup later on and gave up. really unrelaxing. | all areas of hotel seemed busy with non residents (it is right on river walk, which is handy in some ways and not in others). unfortunately had a really disappointing time and would not recommend / want to return. this is a shame as i wanted to try the others in the group in london.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''first time stay here but sadly not impressed. | on the plus side we did have the river thames view (room 481) and the hotel was in a good location. on arrival we found the overall appearance dark especially the corridors,meals &amp; drinks were very expensive, so we dined close by instead. we did venture up to the rumpus roof top bar but could not even get a seat, very over crowded | would not return'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''when we arrived all staff were helpful and very friendly. the hotel room and hotel itself were immaculate, could not of asked for anything better! we only stayed for one night and we had our evening meal and breakfast at the sea containers restaurant. at our evening meal the food was nice, was not great! but the staff's service towards us was not good at all. they were good bringing food out to us but when we finished our deserts it took the waitress twenty plus minutes to approach us and present the bill to us. we waited patiently but we did not want to be sitting watching the young gentleman waiting on the table full of young women next to us! in the end i had to approach him politely and he replied with 'wait one second' and pointed his finger at me which i found extremely rude. then when we paid the bill we had to approach him to give it to him also, he did not seem bothered in the slightest and had a rude manner towards us! then at breakfast we had to approach the waiter again as he did not seem bothered. would not recommend the sea containers restaurant at all, there is not a great deal of choice on the menu either. would of rather gone into the city centre and ate somewhere else. apart from this everything about the hotel was everything you could ask for!'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''this hotel was difficult to find, even with a sat nav because you have to travel down some small alley ways to get to it. the hotel had only been opened a week and it was a nice hotel, however they did not have a pillow menu and i found it difficult to sleep with the super soft pillows. the front desk had a difficult time understanding that i was requesting firmer pillows and heard ""foam"" pillows. they suggested i stuff my pillow with towels to make it harder. sounds of late night club goers could be heard inside our room in the middle of the night and making it even harder to sleep. the restaurant service was very slow, but the food was excellent.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''not impressed with the accommodation. room at the top of the building, felt claustrophobic and started to wonder if there was a fire how would i get out as the windows would only open a few inches due to a lock on them (health and safety locks on them, ha ha) but, forgetting the disapointing room, the public areas and bars were great in the evening, open fires (albeit fake in the lounges) and wonderful ambience in the bars in the evening made up for the grim room. would return, if given a room on a lower floor.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i was explicit. in writing. and i mentioned it twice during check in: i want a premium room that is is nice and very quiet. i got the gorgeous premium room. with the wonderful bed, view and shower. but i also got drilling and hammering. when i approached the front desk, i was told that it was not their fault they were renovating. talked to the manager who said that there were two options: downgrade room (14th floor is quiet), or pay for an upgrade. nope, not happening. the cheese and wine i found in the room post running did not make up for the drilling, unless, of course, they expect me to plug my ears with the cheese and drink myself into sleep. the 50% price reduction at the end might have made me reconsider. however, the mediocre breakfast buffet finally convinced me that the management needs a replacement. especially, because the servers were incredibly rude and inefficient. too bad, the place is perfectly located (especially if you like to walk/run) and the premises are wonderful. i do not plan to be back.'''",1
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''this boutique hotel is lovely and perfectly art deco. the feel is decadent and opulent when in the foyer - though, only to arrive with no one to help open the entrance doors nor with our luggage as we entered into the lobby, and to top it off, no one was there to greet us until the concierge who looked surprised to see people in the foyer said to us ...'oh, i was not expecting an arrival this early in the morning'! well, that did make us question how the rest of our stay was going to be like. i must say, first impressions do stick - i am sure everyone in the hospitality industry knows about first impressions! | moving on, check in was an overwhelming joint effort of several people wanting to help us with our requests, questions and figuring out what we could do until our room was ready for check-in. maybe this was overcompensation for not being there upon entering but the girl checking us in was not made to feel in control and in hindsight compromised her systematic check in approach with us. despite this, the great, friendly service was always certainly there and quite helpful but sometimes the feeling of too many people jointly helping was at times off putting or created the impression that just one person could not deal with the query. as others have reviewed, if you are the only ones in the breakfast room, the feeling of several staff waiting on you or hovering can be quite uncomfortable - especially when you have taken your last sip of orange juice or coffee and you are asked if you want another one, with what seems like it was asked even before you put the cup down! i understand that some customers are quite demanding with service delivery (and did hear of some demanding requests re service whilst there) so maybe some people who stay in 5 star places expect that - but being able to read if a little bit of space or relaxation is needed when on holidays can also be what 5 star service means. i guess it is a fine line but maybe i am just not fussed about being fussed over. in saying all of that, it was the best breakfast we ever had in comparison to everywhere else we have ever stayed - the best orange juice, great coffee made exactly like we do at home and eggs cooked exactly to our liking consistently over 3 days!!! this has never happened anywhere where we have stayed!!!!! very impressed! the rolls royce service was a nice touch, though it would be good at check-in to have it explained when, where and how it can be utilised instead of being made to feel like we were asking to be dropped off to places when it was not actually meant to be in service. the three times we asked to use the service (over three days), twice we were taken being told that it was a gesture outside of service times and the third we were not able to due to luggage issues. this was not explained to us so when checking out we politely made our concerns heard and they were surprised it was not explained to us upon check-in! perhaps the website information is slightly misleading or not comprehensive enough. | overall, our stay was definitely worth the while and purpose of our visit, special for the occasion but for a routine stay or longer holiday, perhaps not the kind of hotel we could stay at for too long. | situated in a great area close to many touristic locations in westminster, close to transport and easy to walk to places of interest which is great.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''my husband booked the dorchester up for a surprise 10th anniversary weekend away and we were both very excited about staying for three nights. we arrived at around 19:30 and were efficiently checked into our suite overlooking park lane. the suite is superbly appointed, with a separate living / dining room, a marbled bathroom with a deep tub and plush furnishings throughout. | we were quite hungry by the time we had settled in so opted for in room dining. we ordered fish and chips for my husband and a salad for myself. when the food arrived, they would only prepared for one cover (even though i clearly pointed out that my husband was having the fish and i was having the salad) so a second set of cutlery was missing as were the mushy peas to the fish course. we just grabbed the cutlery that was out for the fruit basket and tucked in. we were too tired to call up re the missing peas so just enjoyed what was a superb meal. | on going to bed we noticed that the street noise was quite audible, despite the attempt of dampening the sound by having internal sliding windows in place. these did not join up, so did little to keep the traffic noise out. | we turned in at around 21:30 and put the do not disturb sign on. as the suite is in fact made up of two interconnecting rooms, we did not realise that we would have had to put the privacy light on at both doors, would have assumed this would have been activated both ends when hitting one button. so at just past 21:30 we had a persistent ring at the door that did not have the light on, making us crawl out of bed to ask re the turn down service. | surely if you know that a suite has two entrances you check both doors before knocking on the door at that time of the night? also is not this rather late for a turn down service. | on waking up the next morning, we noticed that the nespresso capsules had not been replenished, nor was there any milk available. there were only two capsules left, so clearly had not been checked before our arrival. | made our way down to breakfast but before then checked at the front desk re making dinner reservations in the inhouse restaurant for the same night. the staff on the desk seemed to be very confused as to what times the restaurants were open and when we enquired about the breakfast options (buffet vs la carte) more confusion abounded. | breakfast at the grill was hands down one of the best we have ever had in a 5 star hotel. selection, quality, service we are outstanding. very impressive indeed and the highlight of our stay. | we ambled into town soon after and arrived back at around 11:00. just as we were about to leave again, a staff member checked in re our stay. we asked her to please replenish the nespresso coffee capsules as well as re stock the mini bar which we would tucked in the night before. she assured us this would be done. | 4 hours later we arrived back at the hotel to find that the above had not been actioned on. my husband called housekeeping to ask to have the mini bar re stocked as well as the coffee capsules replenished! 30 mins later, we were given two cups with a couple of sachets of instant coffee!!! slightly confused, we communicate to the staff member that this is not what we would asked for and pointless to boot as we did not have a kettle in the room. | 10 minutes later the staff member returns with a kettle!! by this point my husband was getting rather annoyed. all we wanted was the nespresso capsules and mini bar restocked!!! we must have had three more interruptions of various staff members to come in, take away the kettle and bits we would never asked for and finally deliver what we would wanted in the first place. by the time this was sorted, it was around 16:30! even then, some items on the mini bar were still not delivered. by then we would given up on calling yet again!!! tiresome and all down to not being listened to. our requests were clearly communicated and very very basic! come on the dorchester, the devil's in the detail and all of the above irritations were down to in room dining not listening to our simple requests or not passing on the correct information internally. | the next day, we left the hotel at 09:30 and arrived back at around 15:00 with last nights mini bar still not having been replenished. we were tired and just wanted a quiet few hours in without a potential ring on the door again later on. also, by this time my husband had had enough and went to talk to the guest relations manager. he informed her of all the shortcoming mentioned above and to her credit she listened carefully, without becoming defensive. but, as i am writing this review the morning after, our mini bar still has not been checked or filled up again!!!!! | we got an apology from in room dining re the kettle and room service sloppiness which we appreciate. | in summary, all i can say is, pay more attention to detail, it is sloppy and careless behaviour that soon ads up and tarnishes a stay that should have been perfect. | that is what we paid a vast amount of money for after all!!! | based on the above, i would take my money elsewhere next time and would not recommend the hotel to any of my friends or business connections. what a shame the dorchester'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed for one night only, so maybe we did not get the full picture, but... | having stayed in 5 stars all over the world, including london, this is really only a 4 star. the room we had was ok, small, clean but fairly basic. wine and cocktails were out on the side, but not complementary. view of the river, but noisy air con / heating so when you looked out of the window you were blasted with air. | hotel is trying to be achingly trendy. rumpus room was slightly odd in that it was not a fun bar, more like a stand around and look at me place. the hotel is very conveniently located for the globe etc though. | breakfast was fairly basic compared to other hotels. nothing really worth mentioning. | staff were very efficient but lacking real warmth. we did not feel inspired to return on any level and were quite disappointed considering the price for the room.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the hotel is in the center of london near harrods and many other attractions are nearby. | the rooms are small but ok, breakfast is ok but the breakfast room is much to small and very noisy. though in total a good hotel. but be careful when you settle your invoice at the end of the visit. | they included many amounts which we have not consumed and which is even worse, the promised discount for hotel guests for the wellness facility was not accepted by the lady at the reception.

The Savoy,"'''hard to know where to start for such a top hotel. we were are group of six (couples). my husband and i arrived first and we waited for over 30 minutes to check in.we were shown up to our room which i can only say was ok. there was nowhere to sit apart from one (desk) chair. this was supposed to be a 'special break'. when our friends arrived our rooms were so different, even thought we were paying the same price. we then arranged to join each other in the cocktail bar, but there were no seats, so we just stood around for ages. could not book a table for six. the staff were fantastic and apologetic. we had a table booked at eight pm for dinner. the menu was complicated such in we did not know if we could pay extra for the main menu. the food was ok, but not much choice for me.(i do not eat meat). after dinner we again waited for ages to get a table for for six in the cocktail bar. the drinks took ages to arrive, but again the staff were good. but the most awful disappoint was breakfast. we waited for 40 minutes to be seated together, when we were shown to own tables we had booths. after much complaint we were eventually seated together (2 tables pushed together). i do realise that maybe the staff were under pressure, but that really should not be our concern. i did phone the manager and was told the shethe night manager'she said she would pass on my concerns. i then recieved a phone call from another'manager' to state if we were to book again we would get a free upgrade! just to say this was the most awful experience. it was my 50th birthday, and i can never get that back. and again we waited ages to book out.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''perfectly located for visiting museums, hyde park and shopping at and near harrod's. very comfortable bed, and decent gym next door. but if staying more than a night, be prepared for their peculiar policy, demanding that you pay for your full stay as soon as you arrive, a policy they put in place a year ago (when i told the clerk that i would never heard of such a policy he assured me it was normal); one has to wonder if they need a loan to stay afloat.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''a beautiful hotel and the 2 night stay in a suite was definitely a bucket list experience. no faulting the hotel itself; it was absolutely beautiful. however as an everyday aussie couple we found the service stilted and slightly aloof. we had the services of a personal butler and on arriving fairly late (complimentary chaffeur pick up from airport was fabulous!) the first night we nfound the butler very welcoming and helpful- however it all seemed to stop after that first night. having not been to london in 30 year (the first time i went i was only 20 and tipping was the norm),as it was our first day in the city, i asked the morning butler discreetly what the protocol was in regard to tipping in london in general- bad mistake; i felt embarrassed that i had asked after receiving a withering look and a ""that is up to you madam"". we ate breakfast in the dining room the first morning and had 2 interactions- one was a nice little waitress who took our order, the other was the waiter who plopped my breakfast plate down and instructed me to be careful of the small bones in the kippers. after that we were on our own. staff pushing past our table without acknowledgement- actually brushing into empty plates on our table without even taking them away (when we stayed at the ritz the plates were discreetly removed without us even realising!) the 2nd morning we decided to have breakfast in a much friendlier cafe around the corner (and the food was half the price and just as nice). we had been advised that we were able to use the chaffeured vehicle as part of our suite stay if it was available. unfortunately when we went to the theatre we were told in the morning that we were not allowed to pre book the car but if it was available we could use it. however that night we enquired only to be told the car was booked by someone else. the staff were deferential and polite, but on the whole we felt like they did not think we should be there. (unlike the ritz who made our whole stay feel special). very sad as it was meant to be a real bucket list highlight of london and i was pretty sure my dad (who is no longer with us) worked there in the 40's after the war (did ask staff whether this could be checked out but did not hear back). do not regret staying but been there done that, do not need to do it again...'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,'''stayed here one night in a double en-suite. fairly dated room which needs a much needed refresh/paint. room cramped with an basic/average breakfast. good location for paddington and hyde park. only bonus was that the room i was in had a small balcony - but i am not sure if all rooms do. it was also fairly noises due to thin walls etc. for the price paid (&lt;100 gbp) it is just about ok - but i will not be staying there again as i would sooner pay a little more and get a better room.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we visited the hotel during july on a rare child free evening and from the start were unsure about our experience, firstly the room was not ready so we were ushered through to the cocktail bar with a voucher for free drinks,which was fabulous! | once the room was ready we headed up to get ready for the evening and were disappointed again,what was advertised as a superior room in our opinion was a standard room. | our evening was spent in central london and our next experience in the hotel was breakfast which was a real treat, i especially liked sitting out on the hampton's terrace and enjoyed the views whilst eating breakfast, which was great, there was a good selection and a freshly cooked option also. | we did venture down to the spa but found it to be very detached and having separate steam rooms for us was a bit pointless, the spa design was interesting but i am not sure how relaxing it was! | so our experience was like a roller coaster of disappointment and then a squeeze of magic?!?'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''as we were attending a huge wedding at the dorchester we decided to stay the night. check in was fine and we were taken to our room which was adequate. all ok so far and the wedding was absolutely fabulous so full marks to the dorchester for such a great venue. after midnight the lifts only work when you use your key. what we did not realise was that you can only access the floor that you are staying on - so three couples, staying on three different floors after a very merry wedding found that tricky. did the night porter help - did he heck he was rude and very unhelpful. when i returned to our room to sleep it was impossible due to the noise of a generator outside. i phoned reception to say that it was impossible to sleep due to the noise, which obviously had not been evident when we arrived due to us running baths, watching tv etc. reception insisted on sending up security? someone arrived after 15 minutes so we stood awkwardly listening to the noise which he acknowledged and said he would report back. enough - this was plainly ridiculous so i again phoned reception who agreed to give me another room to sleep in, clearly we were not going to pack up at 3am and move. the other room was pretty dreadful but quieter so managed some sleep. when we tried to get back into our original room in the morning we found all our keys had been cancelled. a security measure apparently - fine perhaps if someone had told us but we looked like we had done the walk of shame lurking outside a room, dressed in last nights gear with a toothbrush in hand trying to find someone to help. we had breakfast, staff were eager but just did not really seem to have a clue. another couple dining with us had to ask for a latte four times before it arrived and getting milk with my tea seemed a feat to say the least - i could go on but i guess you are getting the picture. | there are some very good people on the staff but overall i was completely underwhelmed with the attitude and level of service on offer. it all summed it up for me when the bellboy putting our luggage in the car took my carefully hung full length suit carrier with my ball gown in screwed it up and threw it in the back of the car whilst sticking his hand out for a tip - words fail me.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''this review is about my second stay at the refurbished savoy. stayed at an art deco room which was a deluxe, but small and just right only for a single traveller. beautiful details of the original savoy interior. overall i was sorry to find out that there are huge lacks regarding service levels: | 1) reception: staff meets arriving guest mostly in the lobby, approaching them informal. that is ok and gave me a nice and welcoming feeling. | if they miss you in the lobby, you get into the receiption area and it happens that nobody is there and it requires to look arround and wait for someone. | 2) during my one night stay my key refused me to get into the room five times. needless to say that this was very annoying because it required to go down to reception ... see 1) | 3) once a staff member of cleaning staff opend the door as he was arround when my key did not work again. he found out that there was no electricity in the room. very annoying, because it was already dark and i wanted to change for an opera visit. staff member tried to call someone over his phone for minutes but without success - as other mentioned already in previous reviews - they obviously have no phone answer-policy. so i went down to reception (see 1) asking for support. | 4) once i entered the hotel from back side, was late afternoon. no staff was at the back entrance. so i could enter the hotel, walked through the building and finally reached the lobby (where i was greated by a receptionist). i think that is quite a security issue that back entrance is without any attendance by a securitiy or at least a porter. | 3) afternoon tea was delicious, service very nice but badly trained. | 3) nice staff during night in bar areas but also not adequately trained. | 4) breakfast service was - as during my first stay two month earlier and short after opening - a disaster, in regard of service and food offer (eg. i orded a certain style of breakfast which is described in detail on the menu but they kept on asking for this and that so i wonder why the offer a breakfast menu? | i can quite good understand all of the bad reviews here, i experienced some of the mentioned inssued during my stays. nevertheless: the savoy is an experience, and not the worst one.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''but staff could do with tips in customer service. also was listed as swimming pool but nothing about having to pay to use it. our room was tiny but adequate and had everything we needed. staff did not like it when my sister did not like her raw burger and sent it back, manageress replied she should go to mcdonald's !! no one expects a raw burger unless described as that . the breakfast was substantial and so much choice but cooked option was all cold and over cooked. saying that a couple of the staff were fantastic and even managed to get my sister half price theatre tickets . the location we could not fault and so easy to get around. but incredibly pricey for the room and most of the service. | would not go back'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''having not been to london in years i painstakingly researched my top choices: the lanesborough, dorchester, and mandarin. i ended up booking a junior suite at the madarin after numerous recommendations raving about its location, service, etc. many people discouraged the lanesborough saying it was too stuffy. others discouraged the dorchester citing an inferior location, to which i somewhat agree after walking over there-but to me it was splitting hairs, sort of like comparing different locations in midtown manhattan-all three were within walking distance. however, i was so dissappointed in the room at the mandarin that i checked out after the first night. it was so old and creaky that it just felt dirty and old. the hallways felt dark and dingy as well. the bathroom was so antiquated, with a little plastic fan cut into the window and an old iron tub with a shower curtain that leaked water all over the floor. so i went to the lanesborough and was much happier. while it is very quiet and formal, the rooms and baths seem new and fresh. to be realistic and fair, the mandarin was built literally in the 1800's and it feels like it, so if that is what you want just beware. the lanesborugh, while in an old building was basically rebuilt new on the inside in the mid 1990's so you will get a room and bath 100 years younger!'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''this year to celebrate our wedding anniversary &amp; my 51st birthday we returned to the dorchester, upon check-in we were presented with a complimentary room upgrade, a bottle of champagne &amp; mini birthday cake in room; very special touch! | disappointingly the rest of our four day stay was not quite up to standard with very slow service at breakfast, hard poached eggs &amp; cool to warm food. upon drawing this to the staff's attention we were told all the food is cooked fresh &amp; comes straight to table. | i then ordered one pancake to replace my cold, hard eggs; which sadly after a further 15mins never arrived. | i shared our breakfast experience with one of the 4 hostesses at reception who immediately apologised &amp; promised to follow up &amp; at the very least remove the charge from our final bill. | we arrived back in our room later that afternoon to a very apologetic handwritten note with another bottle of champagne together with a lovely selection of cheeses. | upon checkout we were told the guest relations manager did want to speak with us but was busy with other guests &amp; that the hotel was fully booked &amp; rather stretched. | we have always adored the dorchester &amp; very much look forward to spending time in their lovely hotel, however based on this visit we are seriously considering the ritz or one of london's other luxury hotels for our celebrations next year. | max hilton jenvey &amp; andrew badohu'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed in rembrandt hotel for 2 nights and i need to say it was not worth the money. | the hotel is clean and staff is friendly but the room is pretty small (we had the executive room, i really wonder how the regular rooms are). | at our arrival we could not find any slippers in the room and we asked to reception on our way out the hotel. | coming back, i was really looking forward to get my shoes off but we had not received the slippers so i had to ask the reception again (the second time was a success, we did receive what we had asked for). | next thing i really really disliked is that when going to the spa we found out at the entrance that we have to pay extra(!!!). | the price was 7 per person per day. leaving aside the price (that i find high) what i really found bothering is that after paying about 500 for 2 nights stay, we were to pay again for a service that in my opinion should be free of charge for hotel guests. | we asked to enter and see the facilities prior to paying and we have decided that it was actually not worth the time or money; | the gym is well equipped but very small, the pool is small and the saunas are separate, therefore you cannot enjoy it as a couple. | location of the hotel: very central and close to museums. | breakfast: good, fresh, high quality food/products and okish variety. | overall, in my opinion, the hotel is not worth the money. i do expect more from a hotel that charges 250 per night, even in london.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''came here for my birthday and the hotel itself is beautiful. was shown to our room and we had requested the pink version of the executive king but instead got green. did not complain it was still nice. next day we visited the spa which is lovely then when we were heading out of the hotel asked for an iron and board to be sent to the room, when we returned hours later no iron and had to go back down to reception to ask again. | when we checked in we paid our bill in full so checking out should be simple enough. when we got to the desk they wanted the full balance again. had to show them the bank app on the phone with the large sum being taken out on our first day. they said no that is not right we had only been here one night and stood and argued with us that we had not paid or been there for two nights in the same room. 3 of them round the computer making us feel like we had done something wrong with a queue of people behind us all listening! very embarrassing. | in the end we had paid in full and had been there for two nights so instead of an apology we got 'that is that sorted then!' | we asked for our bag to be kept for a few hours before returning to the airport then called the hotel to say we would be coming in a taxi and could they have it ready, this was too much to comprehend so in the end we just had to let the taxi run and go in and get it. | a very lovely hotel but not 5* service on check out which i see a few people have mentioned (with the exception of the door men who are all lovely and friendly). we will not be back.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''my reception experience was great as it was quick and the staff new their job. the room was spacious, clean, quiet but cold. i had to call reception in order to enable the air-condition for some heat. my check out experience was good too. quick, easy with a smile. i would go back.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''great hotel and location but very noisy pipes/plumbing problems and missing lighbulbs in the room were unexpected at this level of quality. i do not think this is likely to be the norm for most guests so i will put it down to bad luck and would encourage anyone to try this place, it is something special. for a bad nights sleep however i cannot go above three starts, hopefully better luck next time for me.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''i book this hotel last minute and paid 260 (room only, corporate rate, not a particularly busy night). the receptionist described my room as ""one of our more spacious rooms""; i cannot imagine how small the normal rooms were. | the location is great for the city, the rooms are clean, the staff are extremely friendly and the gym is not bad. however, i have stayed in lots of london and this place is pretty poor value.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i stayed at the savoy hotel in june 2011 for one week. the hotel is centrally located, within walking distance of covent garden and trafalgar square. my room had modern furniture that looked like it was in a hotel, though i understand there are rooms that are more traditionally decorated. there were quality of service issues e.g. my room had 3 bathrobes, but on one day the cotton swabs were not replenished. the gym was open from 6:30 - 9 p.m. (not convenient for business travelers). the wi-fi is not free. given the name, i was expecting more.'''",1
Marble Arch Hotel,"'''the hotel is located centrally walking distance to london's tourist sights. a couple of good pubs around, in the same building there is a disco. this is an advantage if you do not want to pay for the wifi. you can go on the club's internet free of charge. | the bell staff was always busy, a little unorganized, the reception was very strict in registration. despite we have paid all the room charges in advance they wanted to have a huge deposit for incidentals, what i found inflexible. | rooms were average. i tried to arrange an upgrade, the reception was willing to give me a junior suite but it did not worth for more money, i preferred to keep the oxford street view. | the breakfast was very rich and delicious.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''we stayed at the dorchester for two nights, courtesy of the bafta awards. the front desk staff was not very accommodating. when we were shown to our room i have to say i was a bit shocked. the hallways were very dismal and claustrophobic. our room was unremarkable. the view out the one small window was of a roof sandwiched in between an alcove of the exterior of the hotel. in other words we had no view and no light coming in the room. the carpet was dirty and basically the furnishings felt very worn. i asked the front desk if they could switch us to another room and they said no. we offered to pay the difference for an upgrade and again they said no. so we settled in and i basically spent my time in the room asleep or in the wonderful big marble bath tub. we visited two other rooms while we were in the hotel. one was far worse than ours. the other was absolutely gorgeous. i suppose it is typical of older hotels for the rooms to vary so much. but all i could think about was the crummy room we were stuck in and the gorgeous one we could have had. | i do have to say that the location was great and the concierge was one of the nicest i have ever come across. i would, however, stay at the claridges down the street and around a few corners. that was a great hotel.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we had never stayed at the savoy before due to the extraordinary prices but we booked it for a special birthday visit for my wife. whilst there is nothing wrong with it, for the amount charged it did not really offer anything special. even though i had told them about the birthday they did not appear to be aware of it or offer any congratulations etc. which is the least i would have expected. | the room was fine but just that. breakfast was good but is priced accordingly (we booked a package price), although to be fair the restaurant is very elegant. we had dinner at the savoy grill which was a major disappointment - again for the prices it simply is not that special an experience.. | annoyingly the hotel overcharged us at the end, adding over 200 for items we had already paid for plus one additional spurious charge for good luck. all were removed but with proper management this should not happen in the first place. | so overall for an iconic hotel i would conclude that they are resting on their laurels and not really trying, or maybe they are not really interested in ordinary guests like us. not sure we will be back and i would be wary of booking this hotel for the wow factor.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i was looking forward to my stay at the dorchester but was rather disappointed. the two main issues were: | 1) they were renovating some of the corridors and for some obscure reason they decided it would be a good idea to place me and one of our business partners in that section: this meant that from 7am there was noise from the workmen re-doing the wallpaper. on my last morning it also seemed like they were renovating the bathroom in the room above mine as there was very lound ongoing noise of building work. complaints to the hotel manager seems to have had little effect although at the end they did provide a discount. surely for a hotel of their standing they should close the wings they are renovating and place customers in the quiet part: secret of a good hotel? a good night's sleep. | 2) the service at breakfast was really very poor, especially on the 2nd day when the waiter kept forgetting most of the order, and then the easiest of the orders (a salmon bagel) took nearly 30' to arrive but then it was cold. promptly we sent it back and asked to have a different waiter, the 2nd was much better but at some stage all appeared to have gone on a breack and there was no one around. | also, the place is just incredibly busy that it is difficult to find it a relaxing place. the rooms on the whole were very good although the decor is a bit dated. do not be misled by the video on the website, it is only the most exclusive suits which have yet had the refurbishment. although the batrooms are very nice and spacious. the minibar was also well stocked although it is beyond me why they cannot provide a kettle and tea/coffee facilities. | we tried most of the restaurants in the hotel and the bar. the food is good without being spectacular (only the bill is), but the cocktails are excellent. i recommend trying the bar of china tang which does superb lychee martinis. | overall, if i have the choice i will not stay here again.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''it was part of a theatre break, so perhaps this was the reason why we were in a tiny room with a view of the back of the hotel. the bathroom was tiny, no bidet, and we were required to pay 9.94 for 24hrs of wifi access - a major downer! service was fab - they remembered our names each time we spoke to anyone on the phone, the hostess at the american bar arranged to have our coats sent up to the room so we could go straight in. we had friends visit us - they gave me a bunch of flowers - which the concierge was meant to send up to the room - they were never seen again, but were replaced with another bunch from the hotel after we enquired about them the next morning. | scrambled eggs runny - had to be sent back, even though i had asked specifically for a 'medium' cook - service at breakfast indifferent - we had the same english breakfast on two mornings - one day my husband got 2 sausages and 2 rashers of bacon, the next we got one sausage and a tray of pastries and a muffin - that had not come to the table the day before. | housekeeping kept tidying up after us - every time they went in the room all my cosmetics were re arranged, the birthday cake that i had been sent and was keeping to eat later had been removed from the room, cups we were using to make tea in were removed but not replaced - each time we had to make a phone call and wait ten minutes for the cups to make an appearance which was quite annoying. | the pillows were very soft, and the mattress protectors made the bed lumpy and it sloped inwards, making for a poor nights sleep - we got better pillows the next night, but the bed still sloped inwards! | service at the american bar was great, though we had to wait 20 mins to get in, the hostess came and found us sitting outside the chocolatier - the drinks were expensive, but we did not have a problem with that - the atmosphere was lovely and relaxed with the jazz pianist. | we have stayed at the ritz and the dorchester and both of them were much better than the savoy - people we met in the lifts said the same! we were disappointed, i have to say, having expected so much more from a prestigious place.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the hotel is being refurbished and this may have affected my experience. the staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful. the room was small though perfectly presented, with a fabulous bed. considering the cost i would have expected some nicer complimentary touches in the room such as tea/coffee &amp; biscuits, some nicer toiletries and at breakfast the option of access to the continental buffet . very good location but i did not feel we experienced anything particularly special, which i would expect for this for type of stay.'''",1

Rhodes Hotel,'''this b&amp;b was a great value for the money. it is not far from oxford street and very close to the tube and train station paddington. bed in this b&amp;b was the most comfortable from hotels i ever slept in. i was happy that there was no old carpet. they had wooden parkets instead and bathroom was newly renovated. i had a single room and it was very little. but ok for 2 nights stay because i have not spent so much time there. only one disadvantage was that you do not have the so much space to put your clothes and that my room was above the kitchen and i could here the owners already at 5 a.m. preparing breakfast. | if you are travelling on budget and do not want to spend huge money for hotels go here. it had better standard than most of the london hotels. | taxi from victoria station costs ca 13 pund.''',1
The Savoy,"'''well, having book in a palace of the fermont hotels, you expect an amaury exprience. reality is far from. entering your room, you recognize the fairmont style and furniture (i was in the people's hotel in shanghai a few weeks ago).... but not the service.... spontaneous service is absent, leaving the field free for service against tip. in such cases of hotel, tip should be a result and never a condition. amenities were surprisingly missing in the bathroom. after some time, the room service corrected the mistake. once more, tipping was clearly expected. this excepted, the room was quite correct, with excellent beds. breakfast was according expectation, qualitative and generous. staying in a fairmont hotel, you think you will have the opportunity of taking a nice cocktail in a cozy bar. nothing of that! all places are crowded by outsiders, with no or very poor opportunity left for hotel guests. as an addition, a large portion of such outsiders do not match the style or education you associate with the strand. no question of discrimination, well of harmonization.'''",1
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''lots of positives: | - great location, especially for access to hyde park, green park and st james park / buckingham palace, and knightsbridge shopping | - new, high quality fixtures and fittings, and beautiful looking suite, especially the bathroom | - attitude of staff, who attempted to be as helpful as possible | - lots of nice service touches, such as shoe shine and post-arrival clothes pressing, plus the offer of butler service to unpack or pack as required | - excellent food in the restaurant | all of the above contributed to a feeling that the hotel has aspirations appropriate for 5 star status. | but it did not quite feel like they are there yet: | - one bath towel per person may be ecologically friendly, but does not feel like 5 star service | - the bathroom in the suite may be easy on the eye initially, but sadly not once the guest occupies the room. there were no storage shelves or drawers, so toiletries were scattered everywhere | - noise from the housekeeping staff mid-morning: there are not many rooms on each floor, yet on both days the housekeeping staff managed to open (and more importantly allow to close) room doors incessantly every few seconds from mid-morning onwards. not ideal for late sleepers (such as those battling jet-lag, having arrived from the us) | - housekeeping twice knocked on the door despite a do not disturb light being lit for the turn-down service. this was an hour before we were booked to eat in the hotel's own restaurant, so it would not have been difficult to re-time this service, though this did not happen. | - several of the tv channels were incorrectly tuned. a relatively popular multi-day sporting event, the ryder cup, was being televised, and the channel in question was not working. this problem was solved eventually, but then recurred on each subsequent day. other channels that did not work included that showing premiership football, which might be also quite popular. | - the main customer lift was out of action for most of the weekend on which we stayed. that our key card would not operate the service elevator was not initially explained, and the wait each time for it to arrive once we were able to access it was considerable. we ended up walking the five flights to the fourth floor multiple times, which may not be ideal for all guests... | - the wine list is impressive and well-heeled oenophiles and hedonists will enjoy the selection, but the mark-ups felt just a little high. this does take the edge off the enjoyment slightly (though the unusual burgundy glasses were a positive). | - the jazz singer happened to have something of an off night health-wise, though this could happen to anyone, so not such a big issue in itself.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''my wife and i just returned from a one night stay. we have stayed many times and try to visit 1 or 2 times a year. | as a regular fairmont traveller i have stayed at many of their hotels over the years and in the top loyalty category in the presidents club. the savoy is one of the best hotels in the group but sadly the restaurant service in kaspers seafood and grill has let them down with very poor service and rude staff. | for the positives, the check in is so smooth and you are taken straight to your room. our room was faultless and i have never sleep in such comfortable beds. all the staff made a point of saying hello to you regardless to where you are in the hotel, except of course the kaspers staff who seem to do the opposite and just glare at you. | our problems started when i booked a package which included a 'pasta party dinner'. despite numerous emails to the presidents club concierge, they could not find out from the hotel what this dinner was. i called the hotel directly and was told the sales team had not finalised it (even though it was only 4 weeks until we arrived). another chaser to the hotel 2 weeks before we arrived and the hotel confirmed it was a 'pasta meal' via the room service that was included. we were happy with that so made no restaurant bookings. upon check in we were advised that a 3 course dinner was included in our package and that someone should have contacted us to make a booking! apparently, it was not for room service. so what this 'pasta party' was, i have no idea but it is a shame we had so much conflicting info. we did not mind what was included and happy to go to the restaurant. to help us decide, menus for the 3 restaurants offering the 3 course menu were sent up to our room and we decided to book kaspers seafood and grill. | upon being seated in the restaurant, we were provided with just the a la carte menu. i asked if this was the correct menu if we were on a package and another menu was then provided. however, this menu was very different to the one reception had given us and had a lot of items missing. i had booked kaspers off the back of the menu and was for example looking to take the seafood platter starter and steak for mains, neither of which was now included. i raised with our waitress that was there another menu and that we had seen a different one? she was quite rude and basically said the menu was always the same and that we were mistaken 'perhaps sir it was the a la carte menu reception gave you'. i wished i had brought the copy with me but i did not want to make a big fuss and embarrass my wife, or go up to the room to get a copy. i was told bluntly if i wanted the steak for example i had to pay the price on the a la carte, so 32. this made us feel uncomfortable. whether it was because we were on a cheaper menu and not ordering a la carte, but after this, our waitress pretty much ignored us and others seem to bring our food. i find it really hard to understand how the staff in this restaurant can be so different to the other restaurants/bars. the waiters/waitresses look like they dint want to be there, no smiling, just glaring at you. there was one guy standing in the thames foyer just looking into kaspers, just staring, looking glum and bored, not sure what his role was. | as for the food, we made other food choices and the food was fantastic, cannot fault it. we had a cocktail each before we ate and again, they were lovely. | for breakfast, we also ate at kaspers, but even worse service. breakfast was so slow, had to queue to get in, for no obvious reason. our waitress was friendly (very different from the staff at dinner) but service amazingly poor. food orders were incorrect - we ordered porridge made with milk, but it came made with water. she asked if we wanted sauces - ketchup etc with hot breakfast but none turned up. we had to pour our own tea. plates were not cleared away, even though we waited almost 30 mins for our hot breakfast. so when the hot food arrived (from a different server) he had to try to remove our plates before leaving the food. we had ordered a small selection of pastries, these did not turn up and as it was impossible to get eye contact with out waitress i had to get up and go and ask her. we end up getting delayed due to the slow service and overall we were there for over 90 mins. | one strange set up is that on the sides of the restaurant there are 3 tables each for 2 people, but they are more like a table for 4 or 6 people as they are so close together. so close that you feel like you are with your neighbours, hardly intimate and again uncomfortable. these need to be move apart or made into a larger group table. | this sort of service in a restaurant is quite surprising for a hotel such as the savoy, so i am not sure what is going on with kaspers. | | i mentioned all of this at check out and they were very apologetic and said they would follow up with the restaurant to ensure this does not happen again. we were offered our drinks we took in the restaurant for free as way of an apology which was not expected but very gratefully received. hopefully next time will be better, although we may stick to the other restaurants where the service seems to be better.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''stayed on a sunday break package. my overall rating takes into account cost and comparisons at similar 5 * london hotels. on arrival waited for an age to be greeted and shown to a very hot reception room. staff i must say are excellent, polite and very professional . we were lucky to receive an upgraded room which was a nice surprise. the room was nicely decorated with quality furnishings, but of a fairly small size, bathroom again small but was pleasing on the eye. all in all nice but expected something a little more wow, but really only a good room at best. i have taken drinks in the american bar some years back, but again this time was disappointed, not great service, staff seemed rushed off feet, drinks fine but nothing out of the ordinary, just standard drinks at very high prices and miserable staff. our package included a set menu at kaspars restaurant and oyster bar , we chose off the a la carte as it was very limited, i can only say it was dreadful. i accept this is a more eat and go , quick bite venue, but for the savoy i have to say really poor, very pleasant staff but incompetent , bringing wrong orders, serving us others meals, bringing us the wrong order when we did get ours, very slow service, could not get anyone's attention, again staff rushed off their feet, when the food came, at best it was just ok and that is being kind. i know it is not the savoy grill (which i think is wonderful) but this experience was very poor. whether we caught a bad night i do not know, because to be fair breakfast back at kaspers was excellent, almost business as usual and expected ! we checked out and after getting our bill re printed due to being overcharged we left feeling really disappointed. i expected a first class experience at this iconic hotel, but got what i could compare to a 4* chain deal. i take breaks and do not mind paying top dollar for the experience, however this time was very poor and forgettable.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''i struggled with the star rating. i could not decide between 3 and 4 stars. it is not that the rembrandt is not a nice place to stay. it is the fact that compared to the last time we stayed there (in 2010) the state of the rooms had dropped significantly and the service was sub par. let me explain: | when we arrived in our room (feb, 20th) nothing worked. power was completely out. i called the front desk and the problem was resolved within 10 minutes. great. (turns out it was a fuse or breaker in the hall). | but then we noticed the stains. when you looked around the room you could clearly see full hand prints, smudges and a few nondescript stains on the wall over the headboard. the hand prints were all over the room but mostly concentrated near the desk. we were not sure whether to complain or not but decided to mention it the next day after breakfast. the front desk manager listened to our comments and told us that she would notify the housekeeping manager. well, nothing was done. the stains were still there when we left and we were offered no other dispensation. | the other thing we noticed that the housekeeping, although thorough, appeared rushed and careless: trash buckets were found on their side, the plug in the sink was left out etc. small but noticeable details. | these were the negatives. on the positive side, the hotel still offers a superb breakfast with mostly attentive staff (although we had to flag one down just to get coffee once). the common areas are clean and generous in size and well appointed. the staff are polite and helpful (at least they listen to your comments). the location is great with easy access to the subway many museums, restaurants and shopping, harrod's and not too far from hyde park. | one interesting addition was the offer of a smartphone to use while there. the ""handy"" is a convenient device for people like us who travel without cell phones. we took with us everywhere. the interface is a little clunky and slow but overall i would call this a useful gadget. just do not lose or damage it. | so, would i stay at the rembrandt again? not sure. unless i found a great deal on the room price i will look elsewhere next time i am in london.'''",1

The Rembrandt,'''stayed two nights here. i booked an executive room which was supposedly larger than their standard. i am glad i did as any smaller is have been unable to move around! the bathroom was generous however. | evening food was nice enough but not outstanding. i chose to eat out on the second night and had a nicer meal and two glasses of wine for less than the meal in-hotel. | the place was well kept and staff were helpful. | breakfast was good. | unfortunately i left a book in the room which went missing in between my checking out and my realising. | overall neither disappointed nor impressed.''',1
The Rembrandt,'''i stayed at the rembrandt for four nights in september. i loved the location...you could walk quickly to the shopping area and the tube station. the only meal i ate was breakfast and it was very adequate. the staff was helpful and courteous. rooms were nice (though a little small). the rooms were made up promptly each morning while we were at breakfast. the elevator took some getting used too. you had to put your room key in and then punch the button. after numerous stops on all floors and lots of laughs we finally got it! did notice we were not the only ones! an enjoyable hotel and would stay again.''',1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i stayed at the mandarin oriental in a courtyard room on saturday and sunday night as i was in london with my sister and her daughter to see justin bieber at hyde park and i was very disappointed with my room, it was incredibly dark, the furniture was very dated, not like the savoy, beautiful and period, more like something your nan would have (and my nans 94!). the room was small, even by london standards and at 1250 for two nights with breakfast and parking it was not exactly cheep! some of the staff are fabulous, remembering you name and saying hi others are not - one doorman on sunday night when we returned from the concert really did not want to let us in - i guess we did not look like mandarin oriental guests it was a bit of a pretty woman moment ""we do not have anything here for you "". we got an email from the mo two days before our arrival asking us for daisy's name and age so they could leave some children's amenities in the room for her, only problem was they did not bother so we had a very disappointed 10 year old. i do wonder why they would bother to send out an email and then not do what they had promised (unless it was to check the third guest was in fact a child, which seems a little underhand!) that said the breakfast was lovely, some of the staff very friendly, location for hyde park unbeatable but we, for three, definitely will not be returning.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''first stay at mondrian was positive overall. the location is great and the check in experience friendly. | the good? | the rooms are clean and smartly decorated. bed extremely comfortable. free wifi a relief. | the bad? | construction noise from 0800 ruined a much anticipated sleep in. the bathroom lights a total mystery. room service quality just average. | consider it.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''so, having just received an email from this hotel asking me to feedback on tripadvisor, i thought i would. | firstly the positives, this hotel location is perfect, with a pleasant outlook from some of the rooms and at breakfast sitting on the south bank of the thames across from st pauls is amazing. the public areas of the hotel are also very smart and in keeping with my expectations of a five star hotel. | sadly, the negatives. on arrival we were asked if we would take a disabled room on the 11th floor, as this would offer us more space and be quieter - we had an 19 month old with us, so this seemed a reasonable compromise given we would only be in the room for a limited time. however, throughout the first night the adjoining room occupants clearly had some sad news, with wailing, screaming and crying keeping us up for most of the evening. the next day we asked to change rooms, which the hotel kindly did. we were given a great room on the 15th floor, with great views. however, the cases, or cot had not been moved as promised in the morning and then again in the afternoon when we spoke to reception to get our new room keys. indeed, i had to go to the old room to collect our luggage and move it myself. please ensure your staff say i do not know or not sure, rather than raising our expectations. finally i felt the quality of the rooms was not five star compared to others i have stayed in previously, no coffee machine, music facilities, average bathroom etc. | in summary, despite the faults above i would happily stay here again for the location, i do however feel there are better quality five star hotels in london that i would consider before recommending this one.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",'''i was quite excited when this hotel came up on my company booking site. i have stayed at one of the autograph hotels before and as i am a gold elite marriott rewards member i thought i would be in for a treat. first the area is not that great. the hotel looks charming once you walk inside and the staff are polite and friendly. the room i had overlooked the front and was very small indeed and cramped. the shower was excellent but using the sink difficult as it was so small and nowhere to put anything. i did not eat in the hotel but breakfast was ok. the size and quality of the rooms did not justify the price i paid.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed here for the first time a month ago. beautiful views, right on the thames. amazing rooftop lounge and excellent restaurant option overlooking the thames on the main floor. weekend was liking being at a nightclub with the party spilling into the lobby (if you are into that sort of thing and i am). room was big but a bit plain. when i checked-in the room was not totally clean from the previous guest which was a turnoff to say the least but it can happen so i will not fault them this time. not a ton of walkout options but a stroll along the thames was nice. i might stay again but other better options in london.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''rhodes hotel is conveniently located on sussex gardens in the heart of the city. upon check in, our family of four were herded to another building on susex place around the corner. we were taken to a cramped basement room where 4 beds could barely be accommodated with little space to move around, we felt like refugees cramped into claustrophobic quarters despite the price we were paying. the distance from the main block meant that we had to do the walking regardless of the weather for breakfast. the dining room, a flight of creaky stairs up on the first floor, was extremely small too with limited items on offer for breakfast. on the whole , a claustrophobic experience - probably because i am used to large, spacious hotels in asia. never back here again.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''this was a surprise for my husband's birthday and i booked a garden view deluxe double room as the pictures on the internet were exceptional. we had to tell the receptionist that we had not booked a smoking room so there appeared to be a bit of a scramble and we were allocated a room. the room we were given appeared dark and dismal and we overlooked the office opposite. someone had tried to paint the skirting boards and there was paint round the edges of the carpet the hall carpet was grubby. this is not what you expect from a 5* and for a room that costs over 500 a night. when i told the receptionist/porter i was told that ""your comments will be passed on to the management"".........................(this is a sigh)'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,'''my wife and i have stayed in several different b&amp;b in london. we choose to be in city central because we walk a lot and use thetube almost everywhere. you will pay top dollar for location but it is the same all over if you stay in central. places fill up fast so make resv months ahead. the rooms and bath (mostly showers only) are old but that is also the trade off if you do budget hunting. i recommend breakfast. wonderful friendly staff at the breakfast room downstairs. breakfast is excellent.''',1
The Savoy,"'''my wife and i stayed for two nights at the end of june. i should say at this point we normally stay at claridges, so it is hard not to compare the two hotels. | the staff were very helpful and the room nice, however it did not have the ""wow"" factor we were expecting, it felt very much like a chain hotel, which it is (fairmont hotels). maybe we expected more for our money. | our room had not been cleaned very well so the cleaners had to come back, even then it was not very clean. the bathroom soap and shampoo etc are the same as any standard hotel, all cutback to the minimum. where the room was situated was noisy outside late in the night. | the bar is small so you can wait for a table which is not right for a hotel of this standard, however when you get a table it is very nice. | overall i would not stay again which i feel bad saying, however claridges wins in every way.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''i stayed there over christmas and boy was i disappointed. not the room. that was lovely and well appointed, but the food was not really nice and the service took quite long to reach my room. so i moved out earlier and went to brown's hotel, where i was welcomed like a long lost relative. at least when i left the savoy i did not have to pay for the food. so there are no pictures of food but the building and the story of the cat is really cool. | did you know that the function of the cat was in case there were only 13 guests at the table, they would place it as guest number 14. you see the staff at the reception were very kind, therefore it was not a complete disaster just 40%.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''this hotel is old, outmoded and dark. add to that amateurish service and you have a very overrated hotel that falls way short of the quality one would expect from mandarin oriental. | i checked in early morning having booked the room from the night before. there were no bathrobes. they had simply forgotten to replace them. then that evening when i returned to the hotel at 7:30pm my room was not cleaned. once again they had simply forgotten and had no explanation. that same evening when my office called to verify receipt of a fax, they were told that i had never checked in. only when my office called them back with my room number were they able to confirm that i had indeed checked in. | the one good thing about the hotel is it s location as mentioned in the other reviews and the two good restaurants. however, there are several other hotels with good location and after all one does not need to stay in the hotel to enjoy these restaurants.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i think you have to put the hotel xenia in to context. there is a sign outside laying claim to it being one of the best hotels in the world (presumably a somewhat lame attempt to claim affinity with the leading hotels of the world, quite another thing). good things first ; the staff - top class in all respects. the delightful maria (please forgive me if i have got that wrong) from malta, behind the bar. the excellent night staff (particularly my new nigerian football expert friend) and doormen. the reception and decor - all good. less so ; the minuscule bedrooms and bathrooms - paris would be proud. an anorexic dwarf might feel restricted. optimisation of space over room to breathe. no light above the bathroom mirror (not a problem for my ugly mug but my wife would 'die'). given the location ; ok but not great. misleading website presentation and limited and overpriced dining options (sure i was told about a michelin star chef, but that does not compensate for the lack of availability of good quality bar food). i am sure xenia is a profitable model but it is not one that would encourage me to revisit, despite the wonderful staff.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''my partner and i stayed at the savoy last weekend. given that this is one of londons top hotels and is a london legend and given that the cheapest rooms sell for around 800.00 a night our expectations were high! | the reception and welcome were good and the room was lovely with lots of nice little touches. where the hotel falls down is with food service. | we decided to have room service in the evening but it was impossible to reach the room service department. the phone just rang and rang. i called multiple times and also called guest services but they just connected me to the same number which rang out, you could not even leave a message. it was very frustrating and disappointing as we were hungry and now had showered and changed into our bath robes and just wanted to relax. we did not want to have to get dressed again to go out and eat! i stay in 4 star chain hotels like crowne plaza or holiday inn for work all the time and have never had this problem so it was really disappointing to be faced with this at the savoy. basic things like this should be a given and should be slick. eventually the front desk helped us to get through and we ordered. the attendant asked if we wanted him to bring our desert with the main course or afterwards. i told him to bring it all at once as i was not confident in the service and did not want to be having to chase the desert on the phone which they do not answer. when he arrived he had not brought the desert but he did return about 20 minutes later with it. | he told us to call when we were finished and he would take the trolley. i did call but of course they did not answer! i was really fed up at this point so i pushed the trolley out which was quite hard as it was big and heavy and there were lots of bumps to get over. | in the morning we went for breakfast. there was only one host allocating people to tables. the restaurant is huge so each time he took someone to a table he disappeared for a long time. we were 6th in line and we waited about 15 minutes to be shown a table, again i would not expect to wait in a much cheaper, ordinary hotel. everyone in the queue was complaining and some people just walked straight in and seated themselves which made other people even more angry. the atmosphere was not good or relaxing! | the breakfast was served a la carte, it was not a buffet which is what i guess sets it apart from other hotels. the trouble is if you are going to serve like that it has to be slick and again it was not! despite the fact that there were quite a lot of servers it took ages for anyone to take our order and then again ages for the breakfast to come. even in a greasy spoon this would have been poor service. when it came the food was delicious but there is something wrong with the service. | on check out the clerk said he would send the bill to my e mail, a week later i still have not received it. | i think if you are going to charge that type of money for a room and really justify your position as a leading hotel you have to get the basics really slick and well delivered and to be honest they were not and that was disappointing. it was a thrill to stay in such an iconic hotel but as for service i think you would be better of somewhere like intercontinental hyde park corner at a fraction of the price but i guess they have to work that bit harder to bring customers back as they cannot use the legend of the savoy name to attract people.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''we had 4 days / nights in the rembrandt, chosen by my wife for its location and a seemingly good price for a kensington hotel. when we arrived at about 3 p.m. there was only one receptionist on duty serving another client and a few porters hanging around the concierge's desk. so a bit of a wait to get checked in. the first impression was not really very positive - direct lighting, gaudy maroon carpet etc. and as we explored the rest of the hotel it became apparent that the interior designer, whoever that was, was seriously ""aesthetically challenged"". there are four colour changes of patterned carpet going from the reception area, through the lounge, into the dining room and then into the conference room. what a clash of colours and styles. everything smacked of the 1970's with varnished wood and mismatching chairs. the complete effect was extremely ""dowdy"" and run down. | our room itself was good enough with all the usual amenities, tea/coffee in the room, free wifi, decent size bathroom, but with a bath with a shower curtain on a rail. the pillows were like sorbo rubber - hard as a trampoline- giving you a crick in the neck. no nice snuggling down here.... breakfast was a typical british buffet - but with hard fried eggs and tasteless scrambled, dried up sausages and tomatoes which tasted like they had been cooked in some strange fluid. the mushrooms were good though and the fresh-cut oranges and melon slices were delicious. toast and croissants very good. | the reception staff on leaving were extremely helpful and friendly printing off our boarding passes for us. | so, all in all everything was o.k. since we did not spend much time in the hotel, visiting the delights of london by day and dropping exhausted into bed at night. however, we did not get any feel-good factor here. the hotel needs a major makeover to rival some of its 4 star rivals in the area such as the kensington hotel, which we will choose next time.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''we wanted to splurge and stay at the savoy this time while in london, and we were really looking forward to our stay. while both the service (for the most part besides a few issues) and location were great, i cannot really recommend this hotel. it seems to just be existing based on its past reputation and its name. the room was starting to look very worn, the carpets were dirty in the hallways, the internet was extremely poor (which the staff admitted to), the air conditioning did not work well, and all in all we just did not feel like the hotel was worth the price. they missed turn down service one night, and they overcharged us for an upgrade (it was fixed, but i feel a great hotel stay does not have issues to start with). the savoy is certainly a nice hotel and i can see why many people love it, but it certainly was not a wonderful stay for us.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i stayed at the ridgemount hotel in a single en-suite room for 4 nights in mid-november. the room is very small, as most other reviews pointed out. i read about how small hotel rooms are in london, but i must say i was surprised at how tiny this room is. this was my first time in london so i cannot compare how big this room is with rooms in other london hotels. the room is clean so that is a good thing. | there is a closet, desk, and tv in the room. the closet is big enough for most carry-on suitcases/bags. do not know if it will fit anything else bigger than that. the bathroom is slightly raised (about 5 inches/ 13 cm) and in keeping with the rest of the room, is also very small. the shower stall is at most 2 ft by 2 ft (60 cm) so you have to keep your arms close to your body at all times. so this may be a problem if you are a big person. the sink has two faucets, one for hot water and one for cold. i find that peculiar since sometimes i want warm water coming out of the faucet. but this may be the way sinks are in uk/ireland. thank goodness the shower is not like that. unlike one of the reviews, i did not have any problem with hot water. in term of toiletries, you are provided with only a small bar of hand soap. so bring your own, or buy them at nearby stores. | the room is on the 2nd floor (or 1st floor if you want to use the european style) right above the office, so only one flight of stairs. as mentioned elsewhere, this hotel does not have a lift so if you have problem with stairs or have heavy bags, you may want to get a room closer to the ground floor. i did not have any problem with street noise since this room faces the garden. i did hear people talking in the office on occasion, though not loud enough to be a bother. on the other hand, i can clearly hear the loud buzzer to the main entrance. you get a key to the main door once you are checked in, but for the people just arriving, they have to buzz to be let in. | breakfast is included. the selection is small (juices, coffee/tea, cereals, eggs, ham, bacon, and a few other things). for me, that is more than enough. it is not self-serve. you sit at your table and one of the staff members come over and recite what is available for the day and bring what your want. | there is free wifi but you have to ask for the password. the wifi signal is decent. there are also two computers available for use in the common room. they also have a vending machine and free coffee/tea, as well as some other stuff in the room. if you need to print something (like your boarding pass), you can also do this from one of the computers, but it will cost you 30 pence per page. the printer is located in the office so you want someone in the office when you do this. there is always someone there so it should not be a problem. | the location of the hotel is great. its only a few blocks away from the british museum and several underground stations, as well as many bus stops. also near enough to walk to many attractions if you like to walk, like i do. for places further away, like greenwich, there is a bus stop at russell square that goes directly there. | i did not have a lot of interaction with the staff, but the few times that i did, they were all very nice. | if you are paying with credit card, you have the option of paying in us dollar or british pound (maybe euro too). i made the mistake of paying in dollar. there is a 3.5% conversion for this. you may get a better conversion deal with your credit card.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''spent our anniversary on a saturday night there and had dinner. | overall a beautiful hotel but a little let down by corridors and lobbies upstairs which are frankly just boring. rooms are well equipped but nothing as spectacular as public spaces. the marble threshold to the bathroom is dangerous to catch your toe on as being all white you do not notice it is raised. the huge shower cubicle disappoints with its lack of power. | restaurant. overall good but thought menu was very restricted in its selection of main courses. the celeriac with my octopus was over salty and the whole sea bass was the same. | once the design wow has been got over they will have to do a lot more to keep up with the competition.''',1

The Savoy,"'''i recently stayed for two nights on a business related trip. in summary: | positive | 1) elegant hotel throughout. looks and feels like a 5 star hotel. | 2) welcomed on entering, fast check-in process. | 3) reasonably spacious room (for london), had all amenities, plus a comfortable bed. the decor was classical, but obviously that is part of the set-up and works well in such a hotel. | 4) powerful shower with plenty of hot water (albeit strangely i had to let it run for 30 seconds before any hot water came). | 5) breakfast options reasonable. i never ate dinner at the hotel. | 6) good location for both business and tourism. | 7) deputy manager on departure had the grace to apologize, although considering the nightly room rate, this hardly compensated for the issue i experienced (see below). | negatives | 1) i could not sleep. the hotel, for reasons that could not be explained, decided to organize a removal truck to do moving at 1am in the morning (right outside my hotel room). it was noisy and relentless. after calling to ask the hotel to stop the activity, the reply was while it was a mistake to have been booked (by the hotel), since they had now started, then they would not ask them to stop. instead i was offered another room (so i needed to pack up and move at 2am in the morning). honestly not what you would expect from such a hotel and not what i would regard as customer focused service. it did not help that i had important meetings that morning. | ultimately you can only judge what you see and experience. i can see how you would enjoy your stay at the savoy as it is a beautiful hotel, but unfortunately, i did not enjoy my stay due to the poor customer experience i received.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''great location for everything. clean, big room and comfy enormous bed, in fact you could have had a party in our room. loved the funky bathroom with the blue floor lights, tv was almost cinema size. breakfast was adequate in a continental way in a very small basement with friendly ladies but a climb of 102 steps that seem to get even steeper the higher you go back to our room (247). even though we had a view over the road that was full of road works there was not much noise even with the window open- the room did get very hot at night. forget showering or bathing between 7 and 9 in the morning as water pressure was highly reduced by fellow travellers keeping themselves clean! | i would stay here again but would ask for a room not so high up.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''i have just returned from a one night stay at the savoy. the room- costing 400 a night admittedly from booking.com it was not a cheap stay. the furnishings are beautiful and the art deco theme runs throughout and attention to this detail magnificent. the room however was cramped and we had a view over the air-conditioning units. on our arrival we asked for tea making facilities in our room as i was feeling a little under the weather and wished to take a short nap. nothing appeared, we rang again and an hour later we gave up and went downstairs. we later called reception and asked for a toothbrush and additional toiletries as i had forgotten some of mine :( nothing arrived so we called down again. | we ate at kaspars with no pre-reservation and the food and service faultless. the waiters were attentive and responsive to my nieces nut allergy and the food divine. | taxis were hailed with ease and the whole ambience first class. on arrival after our theatre visit we went to the american cocktail bar to be told it was an hours wait for a table. as a hotel guest paying 400 for a bed as our rate did not include breakfast i found this disappointing. | we had asked for a times for sunday morning which duly arrived with no supplements, so we called down and were assured they would be brought up. they appeared nearly two hours later when we returned from breakfast. | the bed and bedding were excellent and we all had a good nights sleep. | breakfast was well received, the service again attentive and food of excellent quality as one would expect. | to summarise- it is lovely london luxury but the attention to detail is lacking from a room service angle. it is frustrating to keep having to call down, perhaps if we had booked a suite or more expensive room the service would have been quicker. there are a lot of staff circulating on the ground floor but communication does not appear to be joined up.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i live in london so never need to stay in one of our hotels, i just dropped in here for dessert as there was a gas leak at the pre-theatre restaurant i was using, we were all chucked out, and i missed my pudding! popped into the corinthia and ordered their eton mess and churchill tea. the tea was a lapsang souchong, loose leaf and served in white china - totally perfect. the eton mess had meringue like a rock, tinned fruit, and, am pretty sure, canned cream. ah well, at least the theatre afterwards was very good. maureen lipman, you are a goddess!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the hotel is located in a central area. it offers easy access to the tube. staff is very friendly. best of all, it is across the street from the v&amp;a musuem and a block from museum of natural history. breakfast was nice, but modest.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''just returned from a 5-day stay with our kid. we booked a triple and therefore got a fairly large room with a single-sized sofa bed. hotels here generally count kids as room occupants, unlike you.s. where kids stay free. the hotel is older and has a classic, but somewhat worn feel to it. they have floors of non-smoking rooms. our queen-sized bed was quite springy - but turned out to be comfortable. sheets are medium/good quality. the fold-out sofa bed was one of those awful, uneven springy kinds, but any kid will be happy with it (mine was). the bathroom was tiny - tight for even one person. but it was recently fully tiled and therefore felt antiseptically clean. fixtures (faucets, shower head) were high quality friedriche grohe, much better than you get in you.s. hotels. it had a large, deep bathtub. room furniture was cheap, light-weight quality. no drawer space. ours had trousers press, iron/board, hot water kettle with tea bags and instant coffee, large electronic in-room safe; no mini-bar but we just put drinks out on the balcony to chill! we were on the back side overlooking a small residential street so there was not much noise - however, it was clear that the double-paned windows provide virtually no soundproofing. i would stay away from the front of the hotel which overlooks a busy street. one nice thing about the rooms is that they have large floor-to-ceiling windows in high-ceiling rooms, so you get lots of light. rooms were well cleaned while we were away during the day but the maid usually forgot to replenish some small item like the coffee or washcloth. | the staff is entirely comprised of immigrants - friendly but not well trained. the concierges were not only incompetent but misleading. both concierges had not only never heard about the golden hinde sailing ship of the 16th century, but they also had no clue who sir francis drake was. he got a phone number and called but there was no answer so he said it was closed. i got the number from him and when i called later, it was the golden hinde restaurant. the actual ship had been open all day. they also said the swimming pool at the adjacent health club was open 7am-5pm for kids but when we showed up they said it was closed until 12:30 due to classes. by the way, the pool is fantastic, like a roman spa; the water is very warm, and the dressing rooms/showers are clean, friendly and during midday you get them all to yourself. but as is typical for london, there is an additional charge: pounds 7.5/2.5 for adult/kid per day. | breakfast is pretty basic quality. no unusually good items, except maybe the fresh melons. the scrambled eggs appear to be from a powder mix, the hash browns are in breaded patties like you get frozen and the fruits are from cans (like canned peaches). get it? the coffee is reasonable - strong. i thought the service was fairly good. the hotel restaurant holds about a third of the guests so if you are late getting there on a crowded weekend there might be a wait. there is a large lounge with fireplace that is comfortable but usually people are smoking. | the hotel charges 35p per minute for local calls but you should buy a phone card from a nearby store and dial out to the 0800 number - there is no hotel phone charge for that. we bought america 1st cards - calls to the you.s. were only 5p per minute! there is supposed to be wireless internet in the common areas but it costs a lot. local internet cafes charge a pound for 15-20 minutes - i recommend the one next to the lamborghini auto dealership (does this say something about the neighborhood?) across the street from the tube station which has a fast connection and lcd monitors (open 9am-9pm). | the rembrandt is across the street from the v&amp;a museum, which is convenient to pop over just for an hour browse. next door are the natural history and science museums - the latter has an imax. all have free admission and interactive activities for the kiddies - my kid even liked the v&amp;a (go to the british rooms). the south kensington tube stop is about 3 blocks away. this is a very convenient station since it is on the green/yellow lines as well as the piccadilly line which takes you direct to the theater district around covent garden. families can get family day passes from the ticket vending machine - one of the few good values in town. the station's in a neighborhood with shops, covenience stores, internet cafes and restaurants. i recommend carluccio's (italian - informal, friendly, great food, not expensive - for desert try the affagato or vanilla gelato with thick fiorentina chocolate), crepes de hampstead for a late night snack, or the thai square. harrod's is a 5-minute walk down the street from the hotel. the surrounding neighborhood is very upscale. we felt safe walking the streets at night. in general, this is not the well-run luxury hotel but it is a good value (by london's expensive standards) especially for families.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i wanted to like this hotel. the nautical/warehouse design of the lobby is fun (albeit noisy and doused in some kind of trendy scent). the dcor is modern and a treat to see. even the bathrooms are worth checking out. however, our room was very small, terrible (no) view, and quite humid at night. i know that the hotel has a nautical motif but our room made me feel as if we were on a cruise ship (and that is not a good thing). the restaurant also had a fun feeling and good food but the service was painfully slow. i found the staff at the hotel to be nice and helpful. i also thought that it was great to stay on the ""other"" side of the river, especially since it is so close to the tate modern and the borough market. my recommendation is that you pay for and make sure that you get a decently sized room with a river view on a high floor.'''",1

The Savoy,'''we ate in the grill a couple of weekends ago and went into the bar in the savoy for a drink beforehand. | we ordered an expensive bottle of wine from the menu assuming we could bring it in with is to the restaurant. the experience had been fine up to the point of moving to the restaurant (in the hotel) and we were told the grill did not like bottles from the bar and proceeded to pour three quarters of a bottle of white wine into our 2 glasses. it all happened before i knew what was going on. the glasses were filled the the brim. i was livid especially as the table beside us brought in an open bottle of wine with them when they arrived for their meal. | as well as this we had to carry our own glasses to the restaurant from the bar. something i am very capable of doing but it just hilighted the lack of service and attention to detail of the staff in the hotel. | we were told in the bar the staff in the grill are seperate to the savoy. i suggest if the savoy wishes to keep up its 'high' standards it should try and poach some of the staff from the grill as they were excellent. | i would not return to the savoy for any special occasion. a complete ruined experience. on saying that the food in the grill was excellent.''',1
The Rembrandt,"'''the location of the rembrandt hotel is perfect. the lobby is nice and the staff is very courteous. however, the single room, booked for only one night, is definitely unsuitable for anyone over 1.80 metres. the well appointed room was so tiny and low that the airconditioning was positioned at the end of the bed! bathroom was new and clean.the view through the window was on the emergency staircase. i am sure the hotel has good rooms too, but be sure to check!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''are there any good hotels in london? i mean for less than 300 a night, i am not sure. anyway the rembrandt at least is trying to be, difficult i know, old buildings, strange room sizes, guess there are not two rooms that are similar | one of the things my wife and i always talk about when home in london, is how no english people seem to be working in london anymore.. reception was indian, consierge was italians, restaurant and bar seemed all to be swedish and house keeping like alwats from the caribbean. | friendly check in, no hassle, two tier lobby with a rather boring looking restaurant, did not even try the breakfast, never pays in london anymore, with all the polish and russian run pub's offering better fry up for half the price anyway | small but comfortable rooms, like always in london room is either to hot or to cold, never seems to be just right. | but all in all not an unpleasent experince, great location across from v&amp;a and most of everything with in walking distance...just the london price that i can not help to have a problem with'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''in november we were gifted a stay at mondrian. having stayed there previously and not been blown-away by it then, i was not surprised to see that nothing had really changed since our last visit, some 18 months prior. | firstly on both occasions the queues at check-in have been quite lengthy and once greeted by staff, no apology given. it may not sound like much but its a tad frustrating. | the main foyer is light and spacious, but littered with the most pointless and impractical furniture. whilst a large blue piece of plastic chain is an undoubtedly a nod to the buildings past, its unnecessary and could be replaced with some seating whilst you are queuing. | the rooms - again, given the average price of a stay at the mondrian which is comparative to other 4/5 star hotels in london, they are not anything special. the same grotesque designs extend into the rooms and an uneven floor in the bathroom meant that water started to flow into the main room after a shower. i was not really compelled to tell the hotel management about this as the carpet looked filthy and as if a bit of water might have actually helped! | the one redeeming feature of our stay was the hotel breakfast. the staff serving in the restaurant were friendly (if not as slow as their colleagues on check in) but the food was of a decent quality. | the bottom line is this hotel is more style than substance and offers nothing that is unique or premium that cannot be obtained in a better hotel in the capital for the same price, or indeed less. | would i stay again? probably not.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''the corinthia oozes history and style. it is undoubtedly in one of the most convenient locations for business or pleasure in london, as well as being a landmark in its own right. the entire property is stunning - as you would expect for the price - and the staff, owners and management take obvious pride in their work. while the rooms are delightfully decorated they have gone just a little bit too far. there are only so many vases, glass bowls and other ornaments that can be tastefully placed in a room and this over-stuffing of every visible space means less storage and living space for the guest. add to this a round desk on which to work makes for simply awkward rooms. agreed, many hotels rooms in london and in particular in this area provide small rooms but the layout and design at the corinthia mean you are getting less room than you otherwise could. if they halved the number of knick-knacks and changed the desk for a square or rectangular one the rooms might make more sense and would not mean squeezing between an overloaded shelf and the bed, or having to try and balance as you wedge yourself in behind the desk to work. the heated flooring and towel racks in the bathroom are lovely touches but in the middle of summer the heat from the floor emanates through the room battling the air-conditioning. the unfortunate thing is that because the room was so impractical we took every opportunity to leave the property and therefore did not eat at any of the hotel's restaurants. having said that the corinthia is in a fantastic location that is easily accessible on foot to buckingham palace, piccadilly, soho and much more.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at this hotel for 5 days and 4 nights. the first reception was good. they were friendly and helpfull. and when we got to our floor ( first floor), we thought it looked very good. but we had room nr 176 and the further we got away from the elevators how worse it became. first there were lovely light with the room numbers in them but at our rooms the further back, there were just some plaques on the door. and then we opened the door, first off : absolutely no view. we had plastic on the window. so we coud not see out of the window . we had to step on a chair too see what was behind it. and there were all metal pipes and stuff. we looked out to a shabby courtyard. then we inspected the room further. under the the window there was a radiator full with dust. a drawer from a table fell out. the closet door did not shut properly. the doorframes in the room were a little shabby. in the bathroom the sink were filthy. al night we had sounds from the pipes of the other rooms when they showered and flushed the toilet. we had to have the door from the bathroom open because otherwise there was terrible creeking all night. so we survived the first night. next morning we had a lovely breakfast. good and lots of food and friendly waiters and waitresses. the next day we discovered a leeking pipe under the sink. we told the reception of this problem and was met with a arrogant man. so then in the evening we wanted to eat in the pallette restaurant. in the room brochure it said open at 6.30 pm. well it was closed for all guest because of a party. they said that we could eat in the lounge instead. there were no places left at all. so in the end it was 7 pm and we ordered room service. and that tasted very good. we had the idea that the staff was very judgemental. they only looked at the outside of a person and you cannot look in there wallet. if we were to stay in london again, then we would not stay here again.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we booked through amex, but were not told about the extensive renovations and construction. initially, we were shown an beautiful suite which, unfortunately overlooked brompton road and even the double pain windows could not keep out the street noises. they then tried to move us to a tiny, crappy room on the top floor. finally, they moved us to a corner room, which did not overlook the main road. it had just been remodeled and smelled of formaldehyde. this is because the furniture in the room appeared to have been supplied by ikea. nevertheless, we took the room. | the problem was that half the hotel was not available due to remodeling and construction. there was scaffolding outside the windows and construction noises during the day. had amex warned us we certainly would have chosen a different hotel. | the hotel does have a good location across fro.m harvey nichols and near harrods. we were able to walk to the royal albert hall for a sunday night concert. hyde park is around the corner and it is not a far walk to piccadilly circus. | in light of the construction they should have lowered their price.'''",1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''it might be very well spending millions of pounds on the fancy stuff, but if the basics are done, then what is the point? | the hotel looks fantastic, and the decor is great. but let me give you a couple of examples and you can take it from there and make up your own mind: | the staff are decked out in fantastic uniform, very smart. but, if they do not know what to do, or cannot handle feedback/complaint then the look is wasted. what is the point in having a doormen in a fancy hat if he does not open the door, or take your case down the steps. | the room was well decked out. fancy samsung tablets, great towels and lovely linen, but someone had forgotten to put glasses in for the water and there was no soap. do you really need a fancy donut when the bed is turned down, or would you rather have the basics? | the breakfast looked lovely, but if you want hot food, be prepared to wait, and wait! what is the point of it all looking fancy when you order eggs benedict, but it comes without any hollindaise, or you order tea, but they do not bring milk or sugar. by know you are getting the picture. there is no substance to this hotel, you can tell it is has been designed well, but the service part has been ignored. let us focus on all the fancy stuff, but inadvertently ignore the core stuff that you expect in a hotel, (milk with your tea, glasses with water etc). | attention to detail was lacking. so, ripped carpets in the hall way on the first floor, you might expect to be fixed within hours, but stayed that way for the entire visit. also, the room numbers kept falling off the door. the doors do not have closers on them (another small detail overlooked) so the doors slam shut. bit annoying when the person in the room next door goes out at 6am. i also noticed that if you followed the fire exit signs, they led back to each other!. | two other things i would mention. you get a lovely bottle of water in your room. but only on the first night of your stay. so when you ask for another it is 4.50. ok, fair enough but i was not too impressed and when challenged the night receptionist he did not handle it well. is it worth cheesing me off for a 1 bottle of water (at cost). he would have been better just giving me a bottle to keep me happy. he did say he was going to do this, but later phoned the room to say he had none left, which was nonsense as they had them at the bar! | small rooms, very small rooms. we were not too bothered as you do not go to london to stay in your room. but in the end, it was getting slightly annoying.'''",1

Newham Hotel,"'''we booked the hotel from a london booking site so never read the reviews 1st, upon reading the reviews we were quite apprehensive about our visit! | the hotel was a good 10 minute walk from the station and there are an array of shops and fast food outlets walking down-all good so far. | upon arriving at the hotel we were booked into the room fast and was pleasantly surprised. we paid a 10 deposit for the room key and remote control. (we did receive back upon departure) we had booked a family room and inside were 2 double beds and 1 single. all really clean. there are tea and coffee making facilities, a fridge and tv. perfect for us with children. the shower did take a knack to get to the right temperature but once there it is a ok shower. you do not receive any complementary shower gels or shampoo but again there are many shops within a few minutes away to purchase. rooms are cleaned/hovered daily and beds are re-made although bedding was not changed (i do not change mine every day at home). new towels are added and bathroom cleaned. | breakfast is served from 7-9 in the mornings offering cereal, toast and a full english, apart from the coffee not being as hot has we like breakfast is perfect. our children love their food and have found breakfast fabulous-they choose to eat has much or has little has they like, the staff made an extra effort to chat with the children and have been pleasant with us. | whole in whole we would recommend this hotel - we are a family of 5 and struggle to book places without having to book 2 rooms. we look for location, price and cleanliness when staying anywhere and was happy with what we received. we will stay here in the future if we are to visit london has a family. i would recommend to people who are happy with a basic room, good breakfast and a cheaper option than booking 2 rooms. most importantly to us everything was clean.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''arrived here at the end of november . very quick check in and shown to rooms by informative staff. decided to have a late lunch and was very surprised to find very little choice for residents! | very close to large knightsbridge stores and shops. clean rooms a little dated to our standard, but ok . lots of seating in comfy chairs and an excellent afternoon tea!! | would we come here again? not to sure.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''spent one night with friends,not satisfied with room provided management changed room immediately and free upgrade for the inconvenience. had dinner in hotel, rather pricey for a carvery but pleasant surroundings, breakfast was what you would expect in a london hotel well cooked and plenty of choice. found staff pleasant and helpful and would use hotel again if in london.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''booked an overnight stay on christmas day with 2 premier rooms and the christmas day lunch for 4 at 1430 at the sea containers restaurant - location and rooms both fantastic, but was disappointed with both the concierge before arriving and the lack of customer service received on the day. we had contacted the hotel several times before we arrived to find out if there was anything ""festive "" happening on christmas day itself and as we were leaving very early on boxing day morning if we could have a grab and go breakfast (breakfast at sea containers was already in our room rate) these simple questions seem to perplex the concierge staff who were at a loss to give any advice or suggestions on anything festive supplied by the hotel or in the area on christmas day and after much prompting we managed to get that we could get a grab and go breakfast from room service at no extra charge - no festivities were supplied by the hotel on christmas day(bah humbug). when we checked in to the hotel we mentioned again about an early checkout and a grab and go breakfast - again we were told no problem we could utilise room service. strangely both rooms were charged for the complimentary room service grab and go breakfast !!!! the sweet guy on reception at 5am boxing day was very apologetic - not the kind of service i would expect from a luxury hotel though !!. the christmas day lunch was quite shabby - our booking was at 1430 - when we arrived we were asked to go to bar area of restaurant as our table was not ready - as there no room at the bar we asked for somewhere else to go and were taken to a lobby area where we waited for 45 minutes - nothing was offered complimentary while we waited, no apologies and we purchased our own drinks and also had to ask a ""host"" if our table was ready. the starters were somewhat weak and the mains and desserts quite good - unfortunately the bill was incorrect and although the ""host"" removed the incorrect drinks, she was not open to making the 2 non alcoholic and 2 alcoholic drinks complimentary despite us having to wait 45 minutes for our table on christmas day - great service - disappointed with the customer experience in both restaurant and hotels - both very average'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''this hotel has plenty of positives to it is name. it is in a great location, with plenty of amenities near by and two tube stations within easy walking distance. the staff were lovely and could not have been more friendly, and the live pianist in reception was a really nice welcome. unfortunately, we did not feel our room was quite up to the same standard. | for positive points, the room was nicely kitted out and was spotlessly clean which is always the first thing i notice, we did have some issues with it though. the biggest issue was the size of the room; it was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in, anywhere. the bed was pushed so close up to the windows that you had to walk sideways to get between them, or just climb over from the other side. the other thing we found a little strange was that the heating vent was a large vent, but with a only a small pipe leading into the centre of it. the rest of the vent opened into some kind of maintenance room above ours that the bathroom lights illuminated... it was just rather odd to peer into that room, and see the door etc. the final negative point was the bed, which we both found particularly hard, but i appreciate that comes down to personal preference. | our rate was a lastminute secret hotel so i do expect to perhaps get whatever room is left, but even paying a cheaper rate, we were both really disappointed, especially since so many people seem to have had great experiences.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''not knowing too much about london on places to stay, i picked this hotel because it was next to paddington station - so it would be easy to get to from heathrow airport with heavy luggage. also picked hotel because of price and free wifi when compared to other hotels. | i was able to get from airport to hotel in less than 30 minutes, hotel very easy walk from station. hotel is also near 2 subway stations - so you have plenty of choices for different lines which came in handy. | now the room is very, very small. my bathroom is at home is bigger than this hotel room. it really did not bother me since i did not spend any free time in the room - just used it to sleep. however, this is no place for suitecase. that is how small room was. the other thing is even though the location was excellent for being near paddington station, it is still 20-30 minutes away by subway to tourist sites of london. so going back to hotel during the day was not an option. i do recommend hotel if you want a hotel near paddington, if you want a hotel closer to the tourist sites in london i would select a different hotel, but expect to pay more for it. there is a free small breakfast, but it was not much and after first day, i skipped it and hate breakfast at other alternatives.'''",1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''first of all - this is an edited version of my original review. as i wrote before i was very disappointed by my last stay in xenia hotel, but what made me really angry was that nobody cared. or it seemed so - i sent a complaint and got no answer. as i learnt later, this was due to a technical issue, not an ignorance. the the chief manager tried to contact me several times but did't reach me (probably some email difficulties). he was very nice and eager to solve my situation and appologize which i do appreciate. this is why i decided to revise a part of my review - the one about communication. concerning other issues: they really happened, but i will be hoping it was just a coincidence. let us see next time. | here they are: | 1. clogged sink in the shower dirty water stayed in the basin till morning | 2. huge noise coming either from inside or outside - construction works probably did not alow me to focus on my work during the whole afternoon. i should have been warned, i had an important stuff to do which i have hardly finished. | 3. at 2:30 a.m. (!) the electronic clock alarm in the room began to ring, although i did not touch it at all (i have my own). it woke me up three times, i even thought it was morning and began dressing me up. very stressful, could not fall asleep after this. (mistake in resetting, as i learnt) | 4. problem with the electricity - when i woke up, there was no light, i tried every lamp on the wall. in the end i found out that at least plugs worked normally, so i used small lamps (but had no light in bathrom). i was too busy to manage it, so i let it be and did not call any assistance.

Newham Hotel,"'''this hotel is really cheap, so for a really cheap hotel you should expect broken doors, cold water, creaking floors, and tightly closed rooms. however, the atmosphere around the hotel is really nice, so it is not all too bad. the prices are like 35 per night, and that is a really good price considering it is in london!'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''central location, splendid building (after the recent renovations, although i prefered the old grill and the bar is too modern for my taste) and very luxurious rooms. | dinner at the grill was good but not memorable, and the quality of the service has dropped. service at the bar was not great, but the waiting staff was especially bad at breakfast in the promenade. breakfast itself is also of a lesser quality than in the past (especially the bread) and is now a neglected meal (like at so many hotels). | the spa (ok but not a destination in itself) did not look clean (used towels and empty water bottles everywhere). i reported this several times to the reception but it had no effect. | the hardware (public areas and rooms) is certainly back where it should be, but there is a problem with the software (poorly trained young waiting staff having replaced the older and distinguished staff).'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''my husband and i stayed here for 3 nights recently, the third time we have stayed here. we love this area of london; it is a great location. lots of attractions nearby and within walking distance of many more. | we have always been very happy with the hotel in the past, but on this occasion, we were left disappointed. | our room, was spacious, well appointed and spotlessly clean. we were delighted on arrival to note that our room was located towards the rear of the building, so would be very quiet. | we were surrounded by some very noisy neighbours, who made lots of noise when entering and exiting their rooms. however, i appreciate the hotel cannot be held responsible for that. also on our first night, we were awoken at around 5 am by a very loud male voice, laughing and chatting. we automatically thought that this was once again, our inconsiderate neighbours. unfortunately, it happened, same time, same voice, each night of our stay. we did report it to reception, who agreed with our supposition that it was, in fact, a member of staff, sent to check room doors, for breakfast room service menus. | the receptionist did make a rather half hearted apology and say she would have a word with the food and beverage manager, but no attempt was made to offer any kind of recompense, or call a member of the management team to speak to us. | we found it very disappointing that customer satisfaction was so low on the hotels list of priority. | such a shame, as we have had many happy short breaks at this property, but will have to think twice before booking again.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i have travelled a lot over the last few years and stayed in some beautiful hotels around the world.i was at last looking forward to staying at the dorchester hotel, somewhere i had always wanted to stay as it is one of the hotels that stand out worldwide. | the hotel is perfectly situated in the centre of park lane right next to the park and the winter wonderland that was on. i was so looking forward to my stay. as i arrived at the hotel in a black cab i was impressed with the look of the hotel infact, it looked perfect. unfortunately, the car park area was full of very expensive cars with their occupants revving their engines, which took the gloss off my first impressions, but i later found out that this is the sort of people the hotel attracts and they have no consideration to other people (all money and no class, as my mother would say!) | the reception staff were all very helpful but at times i thought over helpful. despite being 50+ i have not lost my ability to do some things for myself! | the room was fantastic and the bathroom was fabulous , the bed was very comfortable and the linen was fantastic. i was amazed that the room had no tea making facilities there was no trouser press , no fruit and no water as these things are standard in a lot of other hotels in which i stay and they cost substantially less than the room rate at this hotel which is breathtakingly expensive by anyone's standards. | the promenade restaurant is very strange and you feel like you are eating in a corridor and the chairs are low so makes eating difficult, the food on the other hand was very good. | i had to move to north london after the dorchester and stay in a hilton hotel. i found the quality of the service and level of amenities in the hilton far better than the dorchester. | the dorchester hotel should be the best hotel in the land but i feel they have lost the plot a bit , the staff need to be more individual as it sometimes comes across as fake and over helpful . | i am pleased to have had the experience but at these prices for the service i will not be going back .'''",1

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed for over a week. service is very good and the location is just perfect. positives end there. this is definitely not what you expect from a 5-star hotel, much less from a mandarin oriental. room was mediocre, with frequent interruptions in hot water (bathroom ok). small windows with no view (stayed in a queen room, though the reservation was for a king room), breakfast is just ridiculously overpriced (go to harvey nichols just accross the street instead). wireless internet is charged (15pounds per day), gym is very poorly equipped and, worst of all, guests can only use the pool between 8am and 10am, after that a fee is charged (25pounds per person per day - ridiculous). i have stayed paying a very discounted corporate rate and still though it was not a good value.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''stayed 1 night as a treat - used airmiles to pay for a standard room. | on arrival, i found that the booking had not been made and no trace of it could be found on the hotel's computer system. i had my email confirmation from airmiles so the reservation was honoured without too much of a fuss although it was highly embarrassing for me. i had booked a twin room but was told there would not be one available until late that evening. we were going to the theatre so waiting for the room to become available was not an option. we were upgraded to a superior room with a kingsize bed. | the room was disappointingly small although the bathroom was huge with a bath and separate large shower. the bed was soft and comfortable but very high. there were no tea making facilities in the room. there is internet available in the room but astonishingly it is not complimentary! | the decor in the hotel is very nice but not so wonderful that one gasps in delight or awe. it is very pleasant to find corridors that are wide and roomy. ours, on the 8th floor, had a step along it which could have been made more obvious - the hotel should expect claims for injury in the future from unsuspecting persons who trip and fall! | there were 2 lifts available - on 2 of the occasions that we used them, only one was working. | the breakfast was ok but certainly not the best we have ever had. it was marred by the dreadful smell of exhaust fumes that suddenly came in through the ventilation system or windows from a stationary vehicle somewhere outside - fortunately we had finished eating by then! | checkout was a bit of a farce. the bill slipped under our door was incorrect - we had been charged 54.09 for laundry which was nothing to do with us - we had not had any laundry done. in fact we had not had anything extra and the room had been paid for in advance so there should have been no additional charges. on phoning down to reception, this laundry charge was taken off and it was confirmed that we would not have to pay anything. i then phoned again, said we would be down to check out in 10 minutes and asked for an amended bill - i did not want the only record of our stay at the hotel to show that there is an amount due. when we came down to reception there was no bill ready for us. when i requested one again, the printout from the computer was a blank page! it appeared to be impossible to issue a statement showing that everything had settled in full. | all in all a fairly unsatisfactory stay in what we had been led to believe was the height of luxury and service. the personal attention of the staff does not compensate for a faulty computer system. | i was really glad that we had not paid any hard-earned cash for the one night we stayed and had used airmiles but even so, i feel that we overpaid and did not receive value for money. | the hotel's location is excellent for theatres but there are a number of other hotels in the area that may be better.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i planned to stay here with my partner and some | friends as part of a birthday surprise weekend. i mentioned this to the staff prior to arriving and asked if we could have a room with a nice view and if we could have our rooms on the same floor atleast. on the phone i was told this would be ok but when we got there the availability must have filled up? because this was not the case. i also asked about special birthday options but was not told anything would be possible? anyway, the decor in this place is beautiful and the location is perfect. the rooms themselves are decent sized considering most hotels in london have very small rooms. it was a really lovely experience to stay in a beautifully decorated hotel. it was easy for us to get to and get back to after a night out. you can enjoy a wide array of breakfast options in their restaurant with a nice view of the river and the complimentary late check out option is brilliant and i wish other hotels would follow suit. the service was on and off but mostly the staff were nice and polite. we wanted to try to rumpus room bar but was told mixed things about whether we could or not? some people said we could before a certain time and some people said we could not because there was a wedding party. we chose not to check it out in the end. i cannot mention how beautiful the decor is though and the beautiful mix of guests and customers who float around in bright clothes or families in suites really reminded me that this is what london is about, culture, art and fun. i would not rush to stay here again but would deffo consider it. not for a special occasion again though.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''almost every year, my family and i travel to london to attend the last night of the proms in the royal albert hall. every year we tested another hotel out london's numerous premium offers. this time we chose the mandarin oriental right across the street from harvey nichols and neighboring hyde park. to put one fact first: i am a great mandarin oriental fan and i usually stay at a mandarin oriental wherever i am on this globe! but the london mandarin is different in a negative way. when we arrived late afternoon (!), our hotel room was not ready and this information was communicated in a quite unfriendly, purely business-like way. at around 18.00 h our room was ready. the room was quite small and reflected a clear mismatch between price and comfort. the atmosphere and decoration does not reflect the usual mandarin style: decent, positively reduced, nice spirit and to a certain extent easy-going. this place is heavy, lots of ""gold"" and ""cloth"" coming close to a royal palace. the staff is professional but not warmhearted. we did not have the feeling that they go a mile more to meet customers expectation and needs. they are quite a bit uptight and arrogant (london style). moreover, the building is not clearly structured, it takes quite a time to find your way around. compared to the affiliated places i know - the mandarin hotels in washington, d.c., singapore, munich, new york, san francisco etc. - it will not be my place of choice again. it is a matter of taste - it not my hotel, but it might be a terrific place for others who like this kind of overloaded, rich design and distant people / staff.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",'''1st of all this is overall a nice hotel! it truly depends what you expect from a hotel in london as most rooms are tiny... like really tiny. | our room could barely fit our luggage without us tripping over our bags and the washroom was absolutely the smallest washroom i have ever seen in a hotel room.. it is overall size could of been utilized better however how it was designed made it awkward to do anything around the sink as you basically have to angle yourself into a corner to be straight with the sink and mirror.. absolutely odd. | the service is great and our room + the hotel was really clean although the hotel is located a little off the beaten track albeit near the subway. | for the price considering prices in london this hotel has some decent value! basically it is good just not great. | enjoy london!''',1
The Savoy,'''i really felt that we were paying for the name ''savoy''. we stayed for two nights. to be fair they were pleasent to us on arrival. however when we were shown to our room we were not impressed. the room had not been serviced since the previous guest. | the cocktail waiters were average and the grill was nothing special!''',1
The Savoy,"'''we chose to stay at the savoy on thursday the 26th as we were going to the show on the friday. our previous stay at the hotel had still left a desire to explore further. this place is full of the ingredients an art deco lover such as me desire. it is nothing short of mind blowing as to what history and memories are built in to the fabric of the place. | on this occasion i was very surprised to visit the swimming pool and be told i could not swim after a very hot day in covent garden and using public transport. amazed. my previous visit led me to believe the extra mile was always going to be mastered. | this is something i would have just forgot. but when i got my express checkout bill in the morning under my door i was somewhat distressed to see an application to charge me for a 500 plus meal in the thames restraunt i had neither had or signed for. this is by no means acceptable in any way, shape or form. | this compounded another unsatisfactory image i had taken on board of a very incorrectly dressed person approaching what can only be described as one of the best cocktail bars in the world as i was visiting the bathroom. indeed having spent time in the cocktail bar where a 3500 serving of single malt and a 5000 vintage cocktail is advertised in the selection literature one would also not expect to see a member of the pupil or a guest take charge of a piano that was played by a very competent professional for most of the evening. | having sat in the same room on my previous visit drinking the now famous sky fall cocktail in such a different atmosphere i now feel the cocktail bar has something to prove. | this property is nothing short of amazing in every way. i can only assume i have visited on an off day. i truly hope so or i will be pledging my allegiance elsewhere for a super stay.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed here for one night which was enough for us. | the hotel itself is very nice and has good facilities but the rest of the experience really let this place down. | we found it difficult to just sit down and relax to grab a coffee or light lunch as we were told we had to book for the main bar/lounge area which was full. the rooftop bar which was one of the main attractions to the hotel was closed which we was not told about upon booking or check in. | door staff were extremely helpful and on the ball, however, the reception staff where not welcoming at all. upon check in the person that attended to us seemed only interested in selling a room upgrade. she did not check our booking to see we paid upfront and mentioned about charging us for the stay. she just seemed very miserable. | we had the worst night sleep as the room next to us were having a party at 2am and after 4 attempts to call down to reception, someone finally answered and security was sent up, i could not get back to sleep. | the beds are firm and have thin duvets which is not my preference. | we had 2 x breakfast included on the room but they had only put one person down. the restaurant staff were very nice and accommodating which was nice too see, they were one of the better things about our stay. breakfast was really good and the pastries and omelette was lovely. | if it was not for such a bad nights sleep and the customer service on the front desk i would have rated this hotel a lot higher. paying the money we did and not having a great stay, we will not be returning or recommending this to anyone.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''firstly, let me say that i booked the most affordable available room at the hotel for a period of 2 nights in early january 2011. regardless of this, i was still a hotel guest and believe that a certain standard of service should be afforded to all hotel guests, including occupants of the most modest rooms, especially at a premium hotel like the savoy. | overall, the standard of service was extremely high, and the hotel itself is a marvel, the restoration is magnificent and should be commended. the rooms have been meticulously decorated. even the most basic room is more than adequately sized. | however, my stay was marred by an incident on the final night when i was refused entry to the tea room at 9.30pm with my wife when seeking a cup of coffee after an evening stroll. we were allegedly underdressed. i understand that dress standards can and should apply, but in this case, my issues were as follows: | 1. this was the third time we had visited the tea room during our stay in precisely the same attire, with no issues on previous occasions. alleged the issue was with ""sport shoes"", yet the shoes i were wearing were fashion shoes (albeit blue in colour) in which one could not possibly play any sport. | 2. the message that we were ""underdressed"" was delivered in a manner which was haughty and humiliating. it was all the more distressing given the levels of courtesy that we had previously enjoyed. either this individual did not recognize us as hotel guests or did not care. | 3. no alternative was even suggested; the message was simply ""go away, we cannot help you tonight"". i was not sure what to make of it, was the suggestion to leave the very hotel in which one is staying in the dead of the winter night to seek a cup of coffee elsewhere? if so, i find that extraordinary. | 4. after this incident, i could not restrain myself and sought out the manager to air my grievances. he sounded interest in them - so interested that he listened for about 30 seconds and did not bother to ask me my name or my room number. i was simply brushed off. | unfair as it is, hotel guests tend to remember very clearly the incidents that upset them, rather than those that please them, so the numerous friendly and polite exchanges can be undone by a single bad experience. sadly, this was the case for me. i am not sure whether this was simply because i was a relatively less important guest but i sincerely hope not. | as the management of the savoy probably knows, a great hotel is more than just the bricks and mortar (as truly grand as they may be), but the service and spirit of its staff. i hope, in the case of the savoy, the latter can eventually rise to meet the standard of the former.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''had a deluxe double room, very small room with basic double bed, the mattress had sadly seen better days and dipped into the middle so a very cosy nights sleep as we rolled into the middle. | this was a no smoking room yet the previous occupants had obviously ignored this and smoked out of the window burning the nets in the process and leaving a cigarette butt on the floor that housekeeping had obviously missed. | food was good, location was excellent and staff were helpful.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''i booked into this hotel at short notice as my regular one let me down. it is not in a great area, there is not much around other than fast food places and you will struggle to find decent pubs or places to eat there. many people would find the inner city area foreboding. | the hotel is dark grey and unfriendly looking as in the reviewer picture, not the pink friendly looking one in the main picture. i stayed in the 'council flat' type building next to it, on the ground floor. my stay did not start very promisingly as when i first arrived a guest was complaining to the receptionist about his room. however the receptionist was polite and tried his best to help but the guest decided to cancel his booking. | my room faced the very busy romford road. however traffic noise was muted in the room by the double glazing and i never noticed it. room was clean and tidy, including the bedding (which i thoroughly checked after some of the previous reviews here), scuff marks on some of the furniture but i was not expecting regency period antiques for the price. wc/shower clean and functional. bed comfy and i had a good night's sleep although i did wake up a few times as i found the room slightly warmer than i prefer. | cannot comment on the breakfasts as i never ate there. slight disappointments were a) the tea / coffee facilities - 2 coffee sachets, 1 tea bag, 2 milk &amp; no spoon! b) only 1 bath towel. i am not a big guy but most hotels allow you two. a bit of penny pinching here by the hotel perhaps? i am sure if i would have asked for more they would have let me have some. on my second day i did get another towel from the maid. | all things considered it was alright. nothing special, but ok and i would stay there again although i felt it was expensive for what you get.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my review is in the context of price and hotel level, i would never comment like this if the mondrian was ""just another london hotel."" they aim for a special position, therefore need to deliver. | stayed one night this week. many of the rooms face literally no-where (for example, studio rooms top out on floor 5 and ours faced several non descript buildings adjoining), and the site is deliberately unclear (presumably because no one wants a non-view, but honestly....!). many will choose the hotel for the river view, be careful. after fussing with the manager we upgraded to a water-view room for 100 extra. well handled by the manager, and as professional as she could be, but had the feeling a smaller proportion of rooms actually provide a river view than you would expect. | the downstairs is beautiful and truly impressive, but the upstairs corridors and rooms are literally box-like. at this price, one requires quality everywhere. the drinks downstairs are excellent, but the food (we only had room service) is just ok, nothing very special. do not come specially for the food. | the issue is not the service or how the complaint was handled. the issue is that the mondrian is charging top rates for delivering a special feel and experience. you can do much better at the 300 a night level if you spend any time looking.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''my husband and i had afternoon tea at the dorchester on 4 july 2017. i have always claimed that tea at the dorchester is the best in london, and enjoyed the event several times during previous uk visits. we were aware of the dress code (especially as the email reminder went into great detail about the expectations) but were disappointed to see no enforcement of the rules. once of the pleasures of taking tea is being in elegant surroundings with well-dressed people. so i was shocked and very disappointed to see women in jeans, leisure trousers (effectively pyjamas!) and men in polo shirts. we arrived a few minutes before our 3:45 reservation and were immediately shown to our table. however, nothing happened until the appointed time, despite there being many empty places. we were presented with a palate-cleansing floral tea, which was for later in the meal, and then the fresh but very ordinary sandwiches arrived. i would have appreciated a cup of tea at that stage, but apparently that is not their procedure. the scones were tolerable, but the ""homemade jam"" with which they were served was so runny it ran straight off the scone! embarrassing! we chose the wimbledon tea, which was a mistake. the cakes were designed with a nod to tennis, but they were just clever designs and not delicious food. for the money, this is absolutely not good value. there are many other london establishments which offer a far better tea for less. i think this hotel trades on its past name and reputation and it no longer lives up to either. i do not recommend this tea.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''stayed here last year and everything was good - sadly i cannot say the same this time. we had booked 2 rooms and told the hotel we would be arriving between 2 and 3pm. they called several days in advance of our stay to see if we would like to have dinner - having offered to book for us in one of the restaurants they then called back to say that they were fully booked in every one of their eateries. instead we booked dinner at the northall restaurant at the nearby corinthia hotel (which was very nice!). on arrival at the savoy (2.30pm) our rooms were ""not quite ready"" - could we ""amuse ourselves"" for a while and return at 3pm. we duly went out and returned at 3.30pm - sorry 1 room still not available....could we go and ""have a cup of tea of something"" - so off we went for a cup of tea - only to find the foyer fully booked and we were sent off to the american bar for tea (made with teabags) at our own expense. back to reception at 4.15pm (bearing in mind that at 2.30pm the rooms were ""nearly ready"") to be told that a previous guest had been late checking out and the room was ""still not quite ready"". i would had enough at this point and asked for a different room to be made available - which to be fair was agreed with minimal fuss. we all finally checked in at about 4.30pm. at 6pm (having been assured that there would be no problem) we arrived back at the american bar for pre-dinner cocktails - ""sorry there is a 50 minute wait for tables"" could we ""go around the corner to simpsons on the strand for a drink""? really?? come on savoy - get your act together! do not offer dinner when you have no availability, get your rooms ready on time (guests do not care if someone else has checked out late, you need to own the problem and solve it, not make excuses) and for goodness sake sort out a way of making tables for residents available in your bars and lounges! really disappointed!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this was our first stay here. the room was very nice with a huge bed and a small balcony. it was very clean and was equipped with everything you would need. our room was on the side which was very quiet so we had a good nights sleep. we were looking forward to breakfast but were very disappointed. there were no fried eggs so i asked and was told they would come out of the kitchen shortly. in the meantime the rest of my breakfast was going cold and when the eggs arrived (just 4 overcooked ones) i expected them to be piping hot presuming i had been waiting whilst they were being cooked. this was not the case, they were cold. my husband had one off the previous plate that was out and that was cold as well. we poured our coffee as soon as it was served but could not believe that this was lukewarm. we could not believe that a hotel of this standard would serve cold food and drinks. after checking out we went across to the v &amp; a and had an excellent cup of coffee.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we stayed with our children at the mandarin oriental, mainly because of its great location near hyde park. we wanted to do a bit of christmas shopping so it was a great spot. | the hotel is very dark and feels small inside. the rooms are very, very old and dated. we stayed on the top floor and the ceilings are very low so the rooms feel even smaller. as well even though we stayed on a non smoking floor. we had tiny bathrooms which were definitely not a 5 star standard! | breakfast was good but we had to wait for about 20 minutes to get a table in the way to small breakfast restaurant. service was rather slow too. | afternoon tea was lovely. | staff was very friendly and helpful and the service overall was excellent as you would expect from a mandarin oriental. | all in all it was a lovely stay but we can not recommend it. they are in need of major renovation and updating. so it was not for us and we will not come back unfortunately.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed for only one night (valentines night) with my boyfriend. | the room was very small, with two people trying to get ready for dinner and breakfast it was particuarly difficult. considering the pictures made it look like a decent sized room as well. the place was relaitvely clean, amentities were there although a bit on the cheap side. hairdryer barely worked, as a woman with long hair it took me about twenty minutes to dry just my fringe!! | health club was very nice and relaxing, and the staff there were great. we had no offers of help with our bags when we got to the hotel or when we left. breakfast was nice, although there was no fruit and was not topped up. we also came back to the hotel for a drink after our dinner saturday night, we had a cocktail each and they were horrendous - need to use fresh ingredients in cocktails, not synthetic sugary juices! | anyway overall not horrible, but not amazing either! i would recommend this to people on business, i would not advice it for a romantic hotel, possibly family as it is close to many sites.'''",1
The Savoy,'''room very disappointing .no sitting out area.bathroom very small.plug in basin jammed.evening coktail in lounge before dinner very embarrassing .had to make a fuss to get a table for eight.service in lounge at this time also terrible.had to ask several times for somebody to order drinks from.subsequent dinner was average.again had to ask several times for our wine glasses to be replenished.the final disaster of the evening at about midnight was trying to get a taxi to take so one of our party home.the hotel was totally useless in helping.the doorman on duty seemed totally disinterested.all in all having enjoyed the hotel in the past this was a very disappointing return.''',1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at the rembrandt for a long weekend whilst sight seeing in london. we were upgraded on arrival, which was pleasant, to an executive king. the room was not the largest we have stayed in but it was comfortable with a jet bath in the bathroom. there was an expensive but well stocked mini bar and free wifi. breakfast was included and was standard fayre, although for the first tome in my travelling experience the dining room could not accommodate all of the diners and we were required to wait in the lounge area for our number to be called. this did not take too long as the hotel tried to deal with the backlog as quickly as possible, although the behaviour of one or to guests in this respect left a lot to be desired. | our only disappointment was the fact that our teenage daughters were encouraged by the pool staff to use the under 16's changing area which had no cubicle or curtain facilities and had parents coming in and out constantly. needless to say they declined! in fact, of our three visits to the pool we found half of it roped of for rather noisy one to one lessons for local kids. again a disappointment when the pool was small anyway'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i am a regular client of the rembrandt hotel and have always enjoyed my stay. this time though something went wrong and just ruined my whole stay. i was not happy with the first room assigned to me hence i requested for a change. lo and behold i met a very rude 'gentleman' at the desk and that made it for me. although i requested for an early check-in with view toward v &amp; a museum i was tacked into a room behind with view of roof and other buildings. being claustrophobic it is quite clear what my choices are. fortunately the second room was assigned to us by a nice lady at the front desk way after 3pm with an extra fee. fair enough! while waiting, we went to the bar for a drink to buy away time and met an inexperienced waiter wanting a credit card or an upfront payment before serving me wine since the room was not ready yet. this is unacceptable. haven had a long and tiring journey this is the least one could expect. well after experiencing this inconvenience i guess it is time to say goodbye to one of my old time favourite hotels in london. i just hope the management in charge will make massive amendments after reading this review and revalue his staff. there are more and more interesting competitiveness in london when it comes to hotel so one has to step up the mark. mine is just a constructive criticism.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''my wife and i vacationed throughout the uk from mid may until the end of may spending 4 nights in london all of which were at the ridgemount. | to begin, let us start on a high...the location is incredible, you are within a 10 minute walk of 3 different train stations and a bus stop is a mere 2 minute walk, a supermarket, several cafes, pubs, and other shops. there are not any closer than that, but pretty much anything you need is a reasonable walk away. the staff was extremely knowledgeable when it came to travel into the city center, and various attractions. the breakfasts were fine if not enormous (which is great); the typical fare was one thick piece of bacon, one egg, toast, cereal, juice, coffee/tea, sausage, beans, and a grilled tomato. everything tasted ok, not amazing, and not terrible, just terribly middle-of-the-road. | now the not so highs...we had a room with en suite, however it was a small room and that is a very literal definition. each of us had one checked bag, and one carry-on, and while climbing the 4 flights of stairs (no lift), we were advised by the staff member that he was not sure if our bags would fit in the room...we found a way...barely. the room was roughly a ""p"" shape...the leg of the letter was the entry point of the door, which could not be opened if the bathroom door was opened as it was directly across from it...the top of the ""p"" was the largest part of the room and was roughly 7 feet across, that span included our double bed which was completely against the wall on one long side, and against the headboard...very tiny, and if you have lots of bags, stay elsewhere. there was a chair in the room, but it was practically useless. the tv was an lcd model, and got about half a dozen channels, which is typical of uk accommodations. also, you should be aware that there is no soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, or even a washcloth, so you will need to bring your own. | the room was always very clean, but the quality of the furnishings was lacking, they are not even as good as what you would find at a motel 6 in the us. good shower pressure, which was great for weary travelers, and again you are only a few minutes from transport, and about 15-20 minutes walk from a ton of london hotspots including soho.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''firstly, this is the first time i have ever stayed in a hotel in london as i live here so i may have had slightly different (i.e. higher) expectations. but let us start with the good. the hotel itself is in a genuinely excellent location, it looks very impressive throughout. i thought the room was very well designed, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom clean, etc - this was all excellent. although we did not have a river view we did have a nice view of the london eye at sunset so that was nice. we also tried the spa and gym, the gym was well appointed for a hotel gym and while we did not have any treatments the spa was welcoming, peaceful, had a nice steam room and relaxation area. we had breakfast included. it was fine, but nothing special. my main gripe about the hotel was the impossibility of going to (either) bar and being able to find a seat. i understand they are popular venues in and of themselves but guests should not find themselves excluded because they did not plan in advance of their trip - after all this is a hotel bar. i think that is poor service and frankly it was simple enough to take my money elsewhere for a drink. we did eat in seacontainers restaurant where the service was also rather hit and miss which also reflects badly on the hotel (i will not review the restaurant here but in short it is too expensive for what it is).'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''price of a standard room is quite expensive as the room was small and in our case, not the best views. we appreciate this is london so prices are high, but for what we had to pay you would expect at least s robe and sippers. the room was clean and tidy to be fair, so cannot'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''had a couple of nights here whilst visiting london. hotel is in a great location and convenient for the main museums and harrods, etc especially. room was comfortable but not exceptional. breakfast to a good standard although have experienced better. staff very attentive and helpful. | did not dine otherwise as it appears to do a carvery at lunch time which did not appeal and the evenings appeared soulless in the restaurant with very few dining and menu unexciting and expensive for what it was. what we did find however is that just around the corner by south kensington tube is a vibrant urban village with great eateries, wine bars and pubs. we went to a great little italian called pierino which is inexpensive and offers great food with great ambiance. | to conclude therefore, i would stay here again but it needs to do more for me to rate it as a destination of choice.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the rembrandt hotel was chosen due to its location, near to the royal albert hall. the hotel itself was satisfactory overall - the service and facilities were good. we had read reviews and been on the website, however were very surprised the rooms were so small, far smaller than the website depicts and smaller than any other hotel we have stayed in. overall , we were satisfied with our stay, however, i would stay elsewhere next time as i feel this hotel is over rated due to particularly small room sizes.'''",1
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''having looked forward to this i was hugely disappointed, there is no greeting when you walk in, our table was set by the fire on low sofas so we asked to move to table and chairs as you need to be able to sit up whilst eating the amount offered for afternoon tea, we were taken through to the bar area and were the only people eating afternoon tea! it was dark and the music very loud so not a good ambience for afternoon tea at all. so when booking afternoon tea in london, do not be tempted by the name or 5* status as you are better going to a hotel who really caters for afternoon tea. the food was lovely, but i would not have booked or paid this price had i have known the format'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i stayed here for business in may 2013. i have stayed in quite a few 5* hotels for business. this was unremarkable. nothing bad, nothing great. it was central so that was good. price was ok, not value for money. | i had the room for physically challenged - plus was a lot of room around the bed - downside was the bathroom being kitted out not necessarily as i needed. | passages were very long. check in took about 20 minutes when in front of the desk clerk which is not good enough. then got to the room after a long walk along the passages. room key did not work. hence long walk back to reception and back again to room. | check out was quick. i am sure the hotel is fine, i did not have a memorable experience though.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i have stayed at the corinthia in london the last several times i have been to london. it is usually exquisite and lovely on every level, but this time, not quite so. | i booked an executive king room, but it was small, very tight and had only 1 vanity in a small bathroom. i really doubt that that room was an executive king room category. but, really, how can one prove that? | our room was changed, but in that one, the shower was very small, and the shower water was leaking and seeping through the floor into the floor of the toilet. this was a nasty sight, and certainly not conforming with the previous attention to detail this hotel has had in the past. | i hope this is not a downward trend. it makes me somewhat wary of the current standards of this hotel. | i may consider staying in a different hotel on my next trip to london.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''...even by london standards. we had a double room - 2 twin beds. there was not enough room for our 2 suitcases. i considered putting one under the bathroom sink but it was leaking. to get to the closet, you had to climb over one of the beds. there was a desk in the room but no way to use it and it took up valuable floorspace. also, the beds were sloped on both sides so it felt like you we are sleeping on a barrel. the hallways are also extremely narrow. | other than this, the hotel is new, modern and well located. the bar looked very hip but i never saw any customers there. | i would rate it between poor and average if there was an option for that.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'' the staff are helpful and professional. there was one blip. a lack of tissues and low on toilet paper. reported at 6:30 pm. no response by 8 pm. most surprising was the manager's reaction. we are a very green hotel. so no tissues and limited loo paper, i asked. it was replaced very quickly, but for a hotel of this standard we were surprised by his reply and us having to go down to reception and and ask again for the problem to be resolved.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''good location near the british museum. i was given the smallest room i have ever seen (probably was ""cut in half"" from the original one! ) shared bathroom was not a problem as there are several bathrooms available. breakfast was typical english breakfast, with several options; the staff was very friendly.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''amazed at ""top 40 hotel in london"" rating. this is a very basic b&amp;b type family-owned hotel on a long street of similar lodgings in a fairly nice part of london. the rooms are tiny. the bathroom is even smaller. we reached the room (numbered with post-it stickers!) via a steep narrow staircase. we stayed in the annex which is on sussex place, just round the corner from main hotel. it was clean but very basic. not a place to impress a lover on a romantic trip to london! the continental breakfast was ok. the best feature apart from price was location close to sepentine end of hyde park. lovely walk in the morning. close to paddington station and lancaster gate tube. advise to choose only if on very tight budget and do not mind having to step out of the bathroom to use a towel.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''a modern hotel with clean, good sized rooms but found the beds a bit on the hard side. staff were helpful and cheerful. we had continental breakfast which was served at the table and you could have as much or as little as you liked @ 10.00 each. good selection of complimentary items which was nice along with bathroom essentials. as we were going to an exhibition at the museum of london it was very handy. not a great distance to tube station either which was good. able to walk to tower of london from there too.'''",1

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''on the plus side, the hotel is spotlessly clean and the people who work there are very, very nice and helpful. location is good: central bloomsbury, close to transport. breakfast is ok if you like bacon, beans and eggs... | on the negative side, there is not enough bang for the buck here. it is an old, slope-floored building with no elevator. haul your bags up three floors to a hot, tiny, noisy room with one or two plugs and iffy wifi and you begin to suspect that at 140 pounds a night, you are being ripped off. and indeed you are: you later learn that the tavistock hotel around the corner a real hotel, with lobby, restaurant, bar, and elevator has better rooms for slightly more than half the price'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,'''four of us stayed here for two nights february it is true that the rooms are very small but it was adequate for 2 nights. staff were friendly and helpful. good selection for breakfast. nice place to stay for city break as it is so close to paddington and lancaster gate tube stations.''',1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''we just stayed three nights. this was the most expensive hotel of five that we stayed at on the trip and was the least impressive; we will not return. the bed was uncomfortable and the drains in the bathroom were mostly clogged. not what you expect for 5-star pricing.''',1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''my partner and i stayed 6 nights at this hotel, in their annex building, which is a two-minute walk from the main building. overall, it was an average, pleasant enough stay. the pros of staying here: | 1. very close to paddington station and to several restaurants and shops | 2. clean rooms which were serviced regularly. | 3. prompt response to requests; there was a day when new towels were not replaced, the staff immediately provided them when we pointed it out. | 4. our room had a high ceiling and a window, which diminished feelings of claustrophobia. | 5. a decent continental breakfast was provided, with cereals, toast, boiled eggs, cheese, ham, bananas, yoghurt. | 6. bed was comfortable. | 7. they allowed an early check-in. | cons: | 1. extremely small room! our double room was small even for a single person. i realize that is how things are in central london, but this is honestly the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in and i have stayed in some small rooms. the only redeeming factors were the high ceiling, window and the fact that the room was designed well to accommodate a desk, small cupboard and was en suite, although the bathroom could not really have been smaller! very cramped space for my husband and myself and it was lucky that we were out most of the day. my advice would be to book a twin room; we caught a glimpse of one and it seemed a little bigger. and do consider checking into a more expensive hotel if you are claustrophobic. | 2. while the bed was comfortable, there was no space along the sides for us to get onto it. | 3. breakfast room was really small and we had the same breakfast every single day. | 4. while the annex is not far from the main building, it was sometimes inconvenient to get to the main building where there was breakfast and the reception, especially if it was raining. | not a bad hotel especially if you are not staying there for more than 2 nights.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''mondrian is such a beautiful hotel. comfortable beds, amazing views. however, the staff let me down. asking for 100 a night deposit for the room is not ideal when it is already paid for. in a hotel such as mondrian i think you should be able to trust your clients a bit more and not have to take deposits. | i went to the bar on the top floor which has amazing views over london. it is a must visit. however, there was one gentleman who tried to shuffle us along as much as he could and when i asked if he needed the table he got very defensive, snappy and walked away mouthing stuff. we were just finishing up and he could see that but he was trying to make us hurry up more to get more people seated. i just find it rude, especially when he interrupted us and just jumped in. no need but the girls working there were all lovely and we had a good giggle with them.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i stayed at the mondrian for a weekend away after christmas. its in a great location and staff were very friendly and helpful. the room was good too - clean and quiet with nice luxurious details. the main disappointment was the food. the breakfast buffet was pretty average and i was not impressed by the evening meal we had at the sea containers restaurant either. it was not terrible, but the high end design spec of the establishment seems to promise a lot better (hence 3 rather than 4 stars).'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this is my second stay at the mondrian sea containers in the past 10 days, and my third in the past month. this hotel has the components to be great, and it is stylish by almost all london standards, but it falls short from what it could be. some staff members, such as aries at the front desk, are truly impressive. others just deliver a snobbish lack luster performance, which is disappointing and yet important when you are trying to encourage your guest and staff to be ""show ready"" at all times. it is fine to have a hotel that wants to be hip and cool (such as is very well achieved by the mondrian los angeles, the w hong kong, and a host of other 5 star properties globally) but not at the risk of customer service, and definitely not at the risk of making guests feel unwelcomed or that they do not fit in. comfortable beds, clean rooms, great toiletries, and phenomenal river views (if you get one - otherwise you are looking at someone in the building next to you sitting at his desk looking back at you or over looking and listening to the horrendous noise from the construction site and in the building). | if you represent the over 35 crowd with money and influence and travel experience on a global scale (as i do), enjoy the hotel - just try not to be seen as this hotel is unfortunately not mature enough yet to embrace those who may not be ""pretty young things"" and yet drive global trends in business. | their loss.'''",1
The Lanesborough,"'''we stayed here for two nights recently. this was meant to be a part of a weekend birthday treat for my husband. from the time we arrived, our stay was stressful. firstly, our luggage did not make it up to the room. when we were shown to the room there was someone else's luggage in it. i questioned the young lady on whether this was our room and was assured that it was. the luggage was removed and i was told that ours would arrive shortly. we were due to go to the theatre so we were anxiously waiting for our luggage, but it did not arrive. i was forced to go back to the reception desk (as no one answered the phone) to enquire about our luggage. finally, the connection was made and our luggage was delivered to our room. i then requested that our garments be ironed quickly, as we were now in danger of being late for the show, only to be told by our butler that it would be quicker if we were to do it ourselves (given the distance he had to travel to iron the clothes). an iron and ironing board arrived pretty promptly, we ironed our clothes and left for the evening. not the start we had expected, but we were able to leave just in time. we arrived back at the hotel at around 10:30pm. i had booked a table in advance in the library bar. on arrival at the bar, we were made to wait as there were no tables available. and the manager of the bar gave us a table only after i would insisted that we had pre-booked. again, not the reception we had expected. breakfast the next morning was ok, but service was slow, even though the restaurant was not full. a refill of my cappuccino took a really long time, even though we were seated pretty close to where the staff station was. we opted for breakfast in our room the following morning and this was a more pleasant experience. this hotel mentions the fact that each room is assigned a butler. we telephoned our butler on more than one occasion, but received no response. we saw our butler once more, when he attempted to enter the room (while we were in it) to refresh the fruit. my husband and i failed to experience the charm i would hoped we would. instead, some of the time was spent stressing about things which should have occurred seamlessly - luggage, ironing, pre-booked reservations, just basic help. at check out, i was unable to secure a decent explanation for some of the charges on my bill, and left with a distinctly dissatisfied impression. personally, i do not think the lanesborough lives up to expectations. there are other hotels in london which would offer you a far better experience.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i booked this hotel as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday. when booking online i opted for the superior deluxe double room, simply because i wanted a room with a city few. upon arrival to the hotel the check in was very smooth and the staff were amazing, they even provided us with a free round of drinks in order to kick start my boyfriends birthday celebrations. i was told that the room that was intended for us was not quite ready but they had one of a similar standard that was free. i was surprised at this simply because i was informed check in was possible as of 3pm and we arrived to check in at nearing 4pm! to avoid waiting around we went with the room that was free at the time. given that i had paid a significant amount extra to enjoy a room with a city view i was bitterly disappointed our room was frontward facing, to our left we had a building that was undergoing building works and in the far distance we could just about make out the river! this was so upsetting given that the whole reason for paying extra was to enjoy the stunning views that surrounded the hotel. so if you are room is not quite ready, just wait so you do not run the risk of paying 100+ extra to overlook a building site! the evening of our arrival we went downstairs to the hotel bar to enjoy some drinks, the staff here was amazing and the cocktails were some of the best we have ever had! the following morning we opted for room service, may i just point out that this works out to around 25 per person with an additional 3.50 delivery charge. breakfast can be ordered from 6am - 11am. given that were we there to celebrated we ordered 2 vegetarian breakfasts, costing us 57.50 in total. upon arrival there was only enough food for one of us as there had been an error in taking down the order. we were then told that another one would be up on its way in around 20 minutes time. as you can imagine this defeated the whole purpose of ordering room service. we had intended to enjoy breakfast together in the comfort of our own room and we both ended up eating at separate times. not ideal at all! the second breakfast arrived at nearing half 11 which meant i had no time to enjoy my food given that check out was at 12pm! not to mention the majority of it was cold! overall the hotel is visually beautiful, but the hiccups that occurred were not something i expected from a 5 star hotel in london. i remain disappointed that i forked out for a room with a view only to enjoy a building under construction followed by a disorganised breakfast the following day! i was expecting so much and was left rather disappointed.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''perfect location for covent garden and theatre district. a charming atmosphere of elegance and etiquette, the staff are wonderful and accommodating. | our room was rather snug and with an added lay away bed was rather cramped. the bathroom is modern and spacious. was not a particularly comfortable nights sleep for my personal tastes, i prefer a softer mattress and pillows with a little more exuberance!'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we went for breakfast in the thames foyer to celebrate my birthday and were very disappointed with the standard of food. my boyfriend had the corned beef hash with poached egg, which was under seasoned and did not have much taste. i ordered the cinnamon and apple french toast with maple syrup which again was very average and then had to wait while they brought out the bacon they had forgotten, we also shared a pastry basket which was nice but to be honest tasted just as good as anywhere a high street patisserie sells. | the thames foyer itself is a beautiful room and the staff and table settings were lovely but for a 65 bill i can honestly say i have eaten in a lot nicer places in london for a lot less money.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we stayed at the savoy in a family suite for 5 days in september. it is a beautiful hotel and it is in a very central location to covent garden, the thames and the west end. | upon arrival we were hungry and a little jet lagged. the staff treated us like something the cat drug in and we had a difficult time getting something to eat. finally being ""allowed"" to sit in the thames foyer and order sandwiches, it was only 8:30 pm but for some reason they acted like they did not know what to do with a group in casual clothing (we were not in sweatsuits we were wearing jeans, shirts and raincoats). apparently the ability to ""purchase"" dinner does not translate from american to british. | our room was nice but i would not recommend a family suite for 4 adults. it is probably fine for travel with young children but one bath is not suitable for adults. it would have been much better if we had gotten two rooms. | we were lucky in that the weather in london during our visit was fabulous! but in saying that our room air conditioner was set on the lowest setting for our entire stay and it was absolutely miserably hot! while the beds were comfortable the temps in our room never got to a level that allowed for a good nights sleep. hottest hotel room i have ever stayed in and opening the window 3 inches does not help! | they seem to be on guard at the hotel for people who do not belong in the hotel. and repeatedly we had to provide a name or room number to enter the foyer area on way to kasper's to eat. i have never stayed in a hotel were you felt you were constantly being challenged as to where you are going. the toilet, the lobby, the bar, the restaurants. it is the oddest feeling that the staff behaves as if you should not be going where you are going. | we had one other incident that i will share because you should be well prepared to experience this after a day of touring the city. we returned to the savoy looking probably a little wind blown (it is london), i went to the room and my daughter and grandfather decided to go to beaufort bar for a drink. they were turned away, the staff told them that they should go to the american bar. which they did. they ordered two pints which cost 20 pounds. they then walked to a pub down the street were the pints were 4 pounds and we met them there. after hearing the story of being turned away we walked back and our group went to the beaufort, again they were reluctant to seat us until we provided a room number and last name so they could check that we were guests of the hotel. on the whole this was the way of most of our stay. the staff treats you like you just do not fit there customer profile. i might understand this had we looked or acted inappropriately but we were touring the city most days in blue jeans, sweaters, and comfortable shoes but not tennis shoes. we were not in our pajamas or sweatsuits or in any way inappropriately dressed, we were in casual clothing as most people are when on holiday. | we did one evening go to the american bar and enjoyed the piano player, the staff there was a bit friendlier and we had a couple of very expensive but good cocktails. | kasper's and its staff were very good and we had breakfast there most days. | overall, i would not recommend this hotel. | if you choose to stay here bring a fan for your room, wear your cocktail attire at all times, bring plenty of cash and be prepared to be looked down on by the staff.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,'''i have stayed in a few london hotels with work over the years and know roughly what is what. this i felt was at the lower end for the price. the room was tiny and the partition so thin there was no real soundproofing. breakfast was adequate but again less than similar places at these prices. the lounge is more what you would expect in student digs. would not go again and struggle to understand it is high score.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''having been to the magnificent mondrian at sea containers for supper and drinks on two separate occasions, i was particularly looking forward to a mother-and-daughter spa day one week ahead of my wedding. | it is worth saying it was a lovely day, and both mum and i left feeling relaxed and happy... but as the organizer of the day, i was left feeling a little underwhelmed and disappointed by the overall spa experience. | the first thing to say is that the design of the place is breath taking. it is a spa of sheer beauty and you do spend the time loafing about in wonder, feeling like an extra in some futuristic pamper palace blockbuster. they have done a great job . | however, before you can embed yourself in this experience, you have to actually make it down to the basement, via one elusive lift which was impossible to use! from the lobby, we were instructed to call the lift and go to -2... lifts kept arriving at lobby level, but none of them went to the basement!! infuriating. we were in the lobby for 10 minutes trying to call the lift, which meant our arrival at the spa was late and rushed. | after filling in our forms (the music preference question is weird, because at no point did mum nor i hear any songs from the genres we put down, which makes it kind of pointless), a total of three members of staff (3!!) showed us to the changing room, where we were told to put our bags in the locker and come immediately to our first appointment - the facial. we were still in our normal clothes at this point, and when we asked if we could change into our robes, we were told that we could bring the robes with us and change afterwards. we were then hurried to two separate rooms to have our facials. this was disappointing because we thought we were having the experience together... it was supposed to be a mother-daughter day. | the facial was nice, but not exceptional. my therapist delivered a very lack-luster scalp massage while the masks set, which felt a bit awkward to be honest... if you are going to initiate a scalp massage, then do it properly! he also did not remove the mask thoroughly, as when i got into the light i had bits of blue all over my upper lip, eyebrows and under my chin. it was irritating to have to wash this excess off, as the nice oils on my skin came off with this as well. | next mum and i had a little sit in the spa lounge and enjoyed the vintage beetroot sundae - which was delicious, if about double the size necessary! | unfortunately we had to have our pedicures at separate times, which was a huge shame as the salon is set up nicely with chairs next to each other - perfect for a couple of pals to chat which they are nails are seen to. instead, we thought we would use the facilities while the first one had their treatment and vice versa. i have to say, this was the most disappointing thing of the lot. there is one steam room(in the changing room) and that is it. nothing else. no pool, sauna, jacuzzi, plunge pool. for such a high standard of hotel, i was amazed by this. and for that reason, i will not be back. | positives included some of the lovely staff we encountered. and a very nice pedicure, even if we had to enjoy them on our own. | ladies in search of a 'spa day' beware... unless you are in treatments throughout the day, there is not much 'spa' to be had here.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i stay in standard rooms when i stay here; it is affordable and a free huge great full english makes it a bargain. it is not as charming or english feeling as hotels in the same area/star range (raddisson edwardian vanderbilt for example) but you cannot beat it at this price range. honestly, i have stayed in blander dirtier louder places at the same price. if you are looking for something special in london, pay extra. but if you can handle a little dingy but clean decor, good for you:) ask for extra pillows as they are thin! the staff is friendly enough to handle requests like this. the neighborhood is nice and quiet too. and the rooms arn't as small as some london hotels; you can easily have friends over.'''",1
"Bulgari Hotel, London",'''a very stylish hotel with italian touches all over it... booked for afternoon tea....and as soon as i entered the place i got disappointed... the place where they serve the afternoon tea is really dark.... actually they just place you in the corner by the fireplace... the afternoon tea was nothing special .. i was quite disappointed !!! the hotel is fad although!!!!''',1
The Savoy,"'''obviously the interior of the savoy is magnificent - the lobby, the dining room, even the cake shop are exquisite and worth popping in just to enjoy. but i was so disappointed with the service in (what i think was called the museum bar) when i visited with a friend last week. we waited quite a while to be served and when we did we ordered simple drinks to keep things speedy - a vodka and tonic and a vodka and lemonade. the lemonade was completely flat - even though we watched the bar man pour it straight from a new bottle - there were no bubbles to be seen at all. we both tasted it and agreed. the bar man was not very happy about being asked (very politely) to change it. but this drink cost 15! the replacement was much better but i definitely felt as if i had made a fuss. we went on to have lovely cocktails in the american bar but i must say we had friendlier service in the wagamama's next door!'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''set in the middle of a thriving small hotel area of london, very close to paddington station and hyde park and within easy walk (15 minutes) of oxford street this hotel is a prime location. rooms are on the small side as with all similar hotels in the area, but you would not book such a facility if hanging out in the room was your principle plan. very helpful staff and some good banter with the owner each morning at breakfast. | if you do not want to spend too much on accomodation but want to be centrally located and close to a major railway station you cannot go wrong here.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''my husband and i stayed 1 night at this hotel on business. on first impressions the reception and lobby area was small and not as plush as some other hotels. we were allocated a room on the 5th floor. the corridor carpet was shabby in places and the wall scuffed. the room and bathroom were tiny.. the small queen size bed was in an alcove so to get out of bed you virtually had to climb over the bed. the room was noisy. the decor and furniture were ok and the breakfast was fine. the location was very good and we had no issues with staff. overall i think the hotel was ok, but it was the smallest bedroom i have encounted in london and the hotel did not feel like a luxury hotel.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''first of all, the positives: | the hotel is in a great location, right next to blackfriars, with good rail links to gatwick, brighton, st pancras, luton and others. next to the thames, ti has fantastic views, and it is lovely sitting on the terrace, watching all the people going by. the rooms were nice and generously sized, with attractive furniture from tom dixon, and a grey/pink colour scheme that i really liked. in general, i found the design elements of the hotel worked well, and whilst not everything was to my taste, the overall impression was effective. the staff here were generally very nice, with a few exceptions. | now some of the problems: | the power in one of our two rooms was not working properly, so whilst all the lights worked, none of the power sockets did. they sent engineering up and they confirmed they forget to switch it on. (surely, this is something that should have been picked up when the room was inspected). the shower never seemed to get very warm, i left the water running for a few minutes, and still no good. i picked up one of the pillows, to move it across and the cover ripped in two. i hardly flung it across the room, but it suggests substandard bedding. i went to turn the light switch off, and the switch fell off in my hand. also, why does the rumpus room only open at 17:00? it filled up as soon as it opened at 5, which clearly suggests there is demand there for it to open sooner. the wifi was painfully slow, running at 1.9 mb/sec. they boasted you could pay to upgrade to (wait for it) 5b/sec! wow! when we live in a country village and our wifi runs at 35mb/sec and a central london hotel cannot even offer 2, there is a serious problem. | i started this review thinking it would be a good four star review, as i did not hate my stay here by any means. but as i wrote the review, and realised that my list of negatives was getting longer and longer, and my positives shorter and shorter, i have had to revise my conclusions! i think as a whole, the main problem with this hotel, is that it lacks class. you never feel spoilt here, or really relaxed, everything is a bit 'hi guys!' which is sadly not the experience one expects from a 5 star london hotel.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''booked an executive double, upgraded to executive king. nice classic room slightly small for a king. tv too small. we paid 7.50 to use the aquila spa which was pleasant but pool dated. sauna &amp; steam not shared. breakfast dining room lovely. no selection of cheese which is a real shame, cereal limited &amp; fruit not much to get excited about. could be improved. overall a nice stay. fab location &amp; good staff.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''just spent four nights at this property over a week long period. we had stayed here on several occasions in the past and always had nothing but the best to say about the hotel. it has a wonderful location with a two block walk to south kensington and of course, many great museums. | this time we found the hotel very changed, from the lobby to the bar and restaurant area, with the former cozy atmosphere much changed ( and a colder feel). for the price we paid the two different rooms we stayed in were very small and the bathroom/toilet seemed to have been dropped in as an afterthought-not the spacious rooms we remember. staff however were very accommodating and helpful. in summary, expensive for the room we got but no doubt competitive with other similarly priced hotels.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''ok, it was a special deal and we were in a room on the sixth floor (roof) but the room was very small and rather basic, being more like something you would find at premier inn than a short walk from harrods. breakfast was also less than impressive, buffet style that was more like a motorway service station. service friendly enough, but otherwise disappointing.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed here for three nights on business. the tube station is only 3 blocks away, there are nice bistros and restaurants just a few blocks away, and for a quick shopping break harrods is close by. the v&amp;a directly across the street is also a plus. but, the lobby and restaurant are rather lacklustre. rooms service was yucky, but internet service was free (although you could not download anything) and the front desk was reasonably helpful.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''my girlfriend and i stayed for a few nights at this hotel. the room was ok other than the small bed. it is close to public transportation and very nice area to walk around; especially the river banks.however it is very pricey compared to other hotels in the area.''',1
The Savoy,"'''we had a ""deluxe king"" room at the savoy. the room was very small....with only just enough room to move round the bed. the furniture, apparently meant to fit in with the ""art deco"" theme, simply looked like cheap, ikea furniture. to be honest, except for the fact that the bathroom was 5 star level, the rest of the room reminded me (right down to the well worn carpet) of an 89 a night roadside inn. unimaginable really, for 500 a night. i would truly hate to see the lower level rooms. | the lobby is very pretty (though the hard stone floors make it feel cold), and the service was good enough, with one glaring exception. my wife and i were there celebrating our anniversary. this was well known to the hotel, but there was not even a card in the room to acknowledge this. | overall, since the savoy charge the same 500 or so a night as the ritz, the dorchester and claridges, i can not imagine why anyone would stay here....when the rooms are not a patch on the other three. at 200 a night it would just about be good value. at 500 (for virtually he worst room in the house, with a courtyard view) it is seriously a bad joke. | i would stay in the ritz or dorchester any day of the week and happily pay the 500 tariff. leaving the savoy, i felt as though i had been skinned alive.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''hotel location in knightsbridge was good, convenient for upscale shopping, not so much for sightseeing. i would recommend something in mayfair or convent garden area where you can walk to most of the sights. however, tube station right in front of hotel. | hotel building itself is impressive, however interiors need a make over badly! do not expect the usual spotless mo standard when booking a normal room or a smaller suite. very old fashioned and stuffy in style and it shows signs of wear and tear in most parts. having just stayed at the peninsula in shanghai and visited shangri-la at the shard, i was very dissappointed by what they were selling under the mo brand, esp. considering the gbp 400 and above per night. i was told that there will be a full refurbishment starting april next year. before that, i would not return. | however, service in general was good: front desk very friendly and efficient. highlights were doormen and in particular the bellboys handling the luggage and the waitresses in the roseberry caf! | be careful with concierge services, as we had a very unpleasant experience: while they were very good for diner reservations, they tried to massively overcharge us for ballet tickets, by more than twice of the original ticket price, asking for gbp 145.00 plus 5% surcharge instead of gbp 65.00 per ticket, which we eventually paid through booking directly with the royal opera house. i do understand that concierge services normally incur a surcharge and i would always tip a concierge on top of that. however that amount is just unacceptable at all and made us feel being ripped of even before our trip began, particularly because they did not inform us, that direct booking would cost about 40% of their price. of course people who stay at mo properties usually do not need to pinch pennies. however, they are not stupid and will not spend their hard-earned money on nothing. | i would give it another shot, when make over is completed, since building itself provides much potential to being very impressive.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''on first impressions this hotel looked very nice, both exterior and lobby were very elegant. | however we were more than a little dissapointed by our twin rooms the hotel claims to have three bedroom catagories ""superior, executive and grand"" i would have place ours as basic, they were very dark, small and had ring marks all over the wooden surfaces. | breakfast however was excellent and the bar area very cosy. | as far as location goes it was very good for shoping with harrods only 10 minutes walk away. | this is a reasonably priced hotel which is in need of updating some of it is bedrooms.'''",1
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''my wife and i stayed 1 night in this hotel and also booked a massage in the spa. | we requested an early check-in (12pm instead of 2pm) to coincide with our spa treatment. this could not be accommodated, so we left our luggage in reception. | the spa treatment was fantastic (as was the pool) and by the time we returned to reception, it was 4pm and our room was still not ready. we waited at the bar until our room was ready at 5pm. the individual at reception apologised for the delay and offered us a discounted room rate - which we gladly accepted. | we had dinner that night in the hotel which was pleasant. the room was fantastic and so was breakfast. | but check-out was when the fun started. first of all, the discount on the room was not applied. so i had to request this to be included (which took some time). we finally settled the bill and made our way home. | a few hours later i received an email from the hotel, adding another 250 approximately to the bill, due to mini-bar charges being added, which they promptly charged to my credit card. we did not use the mini-bar, so i now had to spend time following this up via a few phone calls and the hotel agreed that they had charged me in error and would reimburse my card. | in summary the hotel is nice, but some of the service was very poor and not expected from a hotel brand of this calibre.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''here is the scoop on the mondrian from my point of view. on the plus side, the room, (a 9th floor studio) was quite large, clean, quiet, (the view was out into an enclosed courtyard) and had a comfortable bed. the lighting seemed a little confusing to me at first. there is some kind of light almost everywhere and keeping track of where and how to turn them on and off as well as dimming them was a little challenging. there was plenty of room to stash clothes and suitcases and the bathroom was fine for two. i guess the design could be called modern. the room was pretty uncluttered and simply furnished with two smallish chairs and a work desk and two small bedside tables. there were plenty of electrical and charging outlets. my beef with the hotel was in its public rooms. the bars in the hotel (one on the roof and one off the lobby are huge, popular and noisy. the vibe in the public spaces, at least when i was there, was ""party, party, party."" i guess i am an old fogey, but it just did not appeal to me. my suspicion is that most weekends are pretty intense and it is somewhat quieter during the week. if you are looking for a a calm, traditional, relatively high end stay, this is not the place. two other things that you should know is that the immediate area around the hotel is dominated by the south bank walkway that is quite crowded with tourists most times. the hotel is very convenient for the national theater venues but not much else. the two closest tube stops are southwark and blackfriars, both about ten if not fifteen minutes away on foot. there are numerous bus lines on blackfriars road. staff were youthful, enthusiastic and responsive, cannot fault anyone there. my friend used the fitness room and the spa on two occasions and found the fitness fine, but the steam room was not working properly and there did not seem to be staff around to do anything about it. somewhat of a disappointment. there is no pool. the concierge desk was helpful in getting us tickets for a popular show. a plus. our hotel stay alone cost 924 gbp for four nights not including a 20% room tax. like i said, the hotel was quite satisfactory in some areas, not so much in others.'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''great location and friendly staff | room are ok but you can hear everything from other rooms. | breakfast very basic but good | i recommend for business travel not for leisure! | tube stop 5 min walking and harrods 10min walking''',1
The Rembrandt,"'''basically this hotel was ok. | on the positive side the public rooms are bright and very spacious and the staff were nice, polite and tried to be helpful. the rooom was a very good size for london, clean and comfortable. maid service was first class. | breakfast was a fairly standard affair. room service was a little slow but the food was excellent and cheap for the area - despite what others have said in reviews. | location is ideal, directly opposite the victoria and albert museum and near the natural history museum. it is also 5 - 10 mins level walk from south kensington tube station. the downside is that it is on the main route to/from the m4 motorway so expect 4 lanes of commuter traffic past the hotel from around 7am each morning - noisy if you have a room at the front | so why did not i really like it? well, it was the little things. | the decor in the corridors on my floor looked tired (they are about to refurbish it). | on the first night my room smelled of fried food as the windows were open and i was at the back of the building- i assume over the kitchens. great view. awful smell. | in booking an early morning call, there was the member of staff who could not understand the term '6.15am'....and i mean could not understand it. i had to repeat it 5 times before he understood | above all, perhaps it was the copy of saga magazine on the bedside table that made me feel it really was not for me! | if you want a comfortable reasonably priced hotel as a good base for exploring london this one should be ok - but i doubt that it will inspire you.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''the savoy was on my bucket list and was looking forward to a stay here. we had a luxury king deluxe room which was ok but certainly did not have the wow factor! overlooked an office block but if you strained your neck and stood on a stool we could see big ben. no fruit or little extras in the room. for the price of the room this is rather miserly. it was meant to be an edwardian room but was a mix of all sorts! art deco central lamp, edwardian mahogany furniture and the smallest wardrobe and bathroom ever! | good points: | savoy grill and kaspers was excellent. most staff were great - professional and efficient, especially the doormen and manager at the american bar. bed and bedding were the best ever. shower was superb. public areas beautifully decorated and meticulously clean and are definitely very impressive. | not so good : | american bar: asked for two glasses of sauvignon blanc - when the bill came these 2 small glasses of wine appeared to be cloudy bay and were 24 each! why were we not offered a choice? check-in information was incorrect - they tried to charge us 36 more than they should. we had to produce evidence to this effect! we were not offered the pre theatre menu (which us much cheaper than the a la carte menu) at the savoy grill - it had to be requested. 10 charge a day to use wi-fi - why? all the above smack of money grabbing. poor lighting in the room. | so, in summary we would definitely come back to eat, but would never come back to stay. in our opinion browns takes top spot over the savoy. we do not mind paying 5* prices at all as we are paying for an experience but we felt ripped off here - especially after our 'cloudy bay' experience.'''",1
London Guest House,"'''i spent one night here. it could have been closer to the train, and took 45 minutes to get into the center of london, but it was clean and inexpensive. the service was fine. the room was a single and small, but had a window and shower,and tv. good french restaurant down the road.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we had two suites on the 7th floor for 3 days and as a family we thought that the hotel with all it offers , was very fine. | on the last day someone entered our room stole all the money out my wallet and my wife's purse. the hotel dealt with this well and refunded our loss. | however .............. it is difficult to say that you have truly enjoyed a stay when you have been violated'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''when you live in a city, it is always nice to actually see it from a visitors perspective...room was clean and bright, reasonably well proportioned, bed was fair a decent size, facilities were okay, coffee and tea, tv and iron and board, ect bathroom was not very big at all, and the shower could do some damage as the water was beyond touchable. | i did not get the early morning call one morning out of four, the window in my room had been left open, so was freezing.. one night. | location in knightsbridge great for museums, and south ken, hotel bar attractive although typical hotel bar prices. | i was up too early for breakfast, so cannot comment. | location - good, reception staff english not a first language, but maybe was the early shift, so would i rely on them for recommendations for pubs and bars or restaurants..? | if i was staying in london, i would either upgrade to the dorchester, sandersen or clariges, or go to a small boutique hotel. | i think it is fine for 1 - 2 nights business.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''front of house friendly . the restaurant is open and pleasant. the waiting staff are very rude, trying to collect plates from your table, when all the guests have not finished. this felt uncomfortable. even when told, a waitress again tried to clear the table when someone was still eating. far to eager to finish service..... food was ok... a little bit odd on days... the wine selection was average to say the least. porters were very helpful indeed. a lots of training with regard to staff. | the rooms are fine. not the biggest but the location is the key.'''",1
The Savoy,'''we went for xmas afternoon tea. the savoy has always been my favourite tea venue. we had a fairly new waiter and although everyone has to start somewhere i do not expect 2nd quality service here. the sandwiches were excellent and refilled when our new waiter remembered. | the biggest issue we had was overcooked choux pastry and macaroons that instead of that marvellous soft interior were brittle the whole way through. | after our tea we did speak to the restaurant manager and was dealt with in a very professional manner. would i return yes in time. i have had so many glorious teas here i would forgive the savoy this time.''',1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''new hotel, stayed a few times now. there have been some pretty decent special offers available since it opened but if prices go up more then i will return to other, better london hotels. | nice rooms; good linens, toiletries and furnishings. public areas are designed well (by tom dixon). big, well-equipped gym and a lovely spa. nice location on the river makes a pleasant change from west end. | we had a standard room with a side view of the thames. the rooms that are officially river rooms (looking directly onto the river) are fine but probably not worth the extra (and if you are offered an upgrade then check whether vat is included in the price quoted my parents were caught out by this and received an unsatisfactory response when they complained). | except for the concierge team and a few of the waiters at breakfast, everyone in this hotel seems to suffer from a major attitude problem. not sure why it is but its inconsistent with the various morgans properties in the usa that i frequently stay in, and in london hotels more generally. receptionists were pretty blunt; staff in the rumpus room rude; general air of unfriendliness, unhappiness and haughtiness throughout. | a note on the rumpus room, the rooftop bar. great views over london but drinks are over-priced and there is a 10-15% (?) service charge added to your drinks even if you go up to the bar and order them yourself (as we did because the table service was so dreadful). add in a staff with amazingly crappy attitude problems and its a venue we certainly will not patron again (for leisure or corporate). the venue has a dress policy (e.g. no trainers or shorts) and that is fine (albeit unlike most london venues these days) but it was managed very rudely and inconsistently, which was unfair on some guests we invited to join us. | note there is major construction work behind the hotel for the next few months, meaning closed roads and congested traffic.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''my parents and i stayed at this hotel for an additional night in london after a two-week long globus tour. our original london hotel, the doubletree hilton at hyde park, could not accommodate our extra night. | immediately upon arrival, i found that the hotel felt more like a hostel than the other, larger hotels in the area--it was more informal, much smaller, and slightly kitschy (not necessarily a bad thing). the young man working at reception was polite upon check-in, though i do not believe he so much as cracked a smile during the 10 minute interaction. | my parents and i were in room 217, at the very end of the hallway on the ground floor of the main building at 195 sussex gardens, which contained a double bed, a twin-sized bed, and a pull-out leather love seat (i was told in my confirmation e-mail that i would have a room in the annex building and was never made aware of a change in the booking. it did not bother me in the least, though i would have preferred to receive some kind of notice about a change). the hardwood floors were nice, but the bathroom was itty-itty-bitty (i am a size 8 and had to shuffle and spin to get ready for my shower. both the faucet and the shower have the best water pressure i have experienced in london, though). all of the appliances were dated but functional, and the most modern thing about our room was the tv. | the room was clean, the mattresses and bedding seemed clean (after a traumatic experience elsewhere in the world, i always do thorough inspections upon arrival), and the bathroom was tidy as well. i did find an earring on the floor that did not belong to anyone in our party (it wound up gouged in the bottom of my bare foot--ouch!). there was a single window tucked into a nook by the bathroom, and the window opened into a very small inner courtyard, so sunlight was limited in the room. the visual appeal was not great--chipping lower wall paint, marks on the upper walls, horrible orange bedcovers, visible plumbing in the bathroom--but the room was functional and relatively clean. | other than the rogue earring, the ac in our room made a creaking/wheezing sound every few seconds, which made it difficult to fall asleep (it was stuffy in the room, which meant the noisy ac was the better of two evils). i also found several bits of broken, black plastic in and around my bed, which was a little off-putting. | breakfast was downstairs in a cute but very cramped room. it was sub-par at best. the pastries were stale, the yogurt was tesco brand, and the coffee was blechhh. there was some fruit that my mother enjoyed, three cereal options, and the breakfast attendant made us toast. my dad--the least picky eater i know--said it was ""edible but not enjoyable."" it certainly will not hold you if you are planning a heavy day of sight seeing. | i do feel that the hotel builds itself up in the website descriptions. while the proprietors and website emphasize the""charm"" and ""elegance"" of the building, i would not necessarily describe it as ""charming"" or ""elegant."" there were smelly trash bags sitting in front of the hotel entrance upon arrival and throughout the day, and the rooms were very basic but functional. there is some cool carpeting in reception, but that is more ""quirky"" than ""elegant."" my mom said it was ""dated"" but ""quaint."" alas, we agree to disagree where adjectives are concerned. | on a somewhat positive note, the staff was relatively friendly and accommodating from the moment i booked the hotel. when booking, my card was declined due to my bank's policies safe-guarding against fraud (all international purchases result in a block). niaz was very understanding and re-ran the card after the block was lifted. also, upon arrival, the man in reception arranged for an airport transfer for just 38, which was by far the lowest transfer quote i found. my dad commented that the on-site interactions with staff were ""no-nonsense"" and ""quite terse."" i preferred to call it""efficient,"" though, admittedly, it was not as warm and welcoming as we are used to. | as for interaction with customers following their stays, i was looking at some of the 2-3 star ratings on tripadvisor before posting this, and i was appalled by the hotel personnels' responses to the lower-starred reviews. whoever was responding to the reviews was aggressive and blatantly annoyed by the criticism. in response to that, i would like to note that the above observations are my honest opinions based off the services i received during my stay (i am writing this the day of check-out). all information i have given has been accurate and all comparisons i have made have been between the rhodes and comparable hotels (based on location and price range). i am a paying customer and will not be berated or bullied for my opinions of a sub-par hotel experience. if the hotel cannot take criticism, too bad. do not tell guests that they could have paid more to stay somewhere better, because a) as a frequent london traveller, i know for a fact that travelers can also pay less for better, b) it shows bad customer service and c) it is just plain rude. i took a chance booking with rhodes, hoping for a wonderful hotel. i was quite disappointed with my decision and it is not one that i will make again. if i had read the hotel's responses to reviews containing criticism before booking, i would have spent my hard-earned money elsewhere. good customer service means taking criticism in stride and striving to make guests' experiences better, not getting offended and attacking honest opinions with snide comments about room dimensions and catty remarks regarding semantics. | last, but not least, the ""free wifi"" in the room did not work worth a damn during the entirety of our stay. when i asked at reception, the attendant tersely advised me to sign on to the ""rhodeshotel"" option instead of the ""rhodeshotel"" one. however, the former wifi network disappeared as soon as i left the lobby area. i ended up successfully signing into a different hotel's wifi with the same password that the rhodes hotel uses (tried it on a whim, it worked). | as for the price tag, i paid $313 usd (180 gbp) for a one-night stay in a triple occupancy room (""triple en-suite""). while the location is relatively convenient (a few-minutes' walk to both lancaster gate and paddington tube stations), i was aghast when i saw how basic the room was, especially when comparing the hotel with our previous hotel just down the street, which was slightly cheaper and much more modern, well-equipped, and--to be honest--much more comfortable. my parents said that it would have been fine for something in the $150 price range, but $300+ dollars? no way. | in short, i think it is an acceptable hotel if you are looking for a convenient location and a basic, no-frills stay and are willing to pay a pretty penny for both and cannot find anywhere else to stay. if you want bells-and-whistles and fair pricing, you will want to look at some different options. when i return to london next, i will definitely book with another one of my previous hotels. | overall, a thoroughly average experience and rather disappointing for the price.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''cannot fault the hotel itself, beautiful hotel, beautiful rooms and super location. | the only fly in the ointment really - we arrived at 5.30pm and were left waiting until about 6.15 in reception for a room key, until we queried it and were told our room was not ready?! | we were then charged for the room twice as we had prepaid for our stay - this was not picked up on by the staff who checked us in or out - only until we checked out bank balance did we realise this, they have since then sent us a refund invoice and then to follow another billing invoice for items that were not picked up on from the mini bar at the time of departure!!!! | the only saving grave were the concierge who picked up and dropped off our vehicle and the lovely gentleman who took us to collect our vehicle the next day. | all in all, beautiful hotel but alot of miscommunication spoilt it.'''",1

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''stay a couple of months per year in london and decided to try the corinthia this time given the positive reviews on this website. had high expectations, but was extremely disappointed when i arrived.my room was a small box that just fitted the bed. i cannot even poperly open my suitcase. have stayed in many 5 star hotels in london and this is by far the smallest room i have ever experienced. definitely not a great experience. assume they have larger rooms as well, but if you do not want to end up in a room that can hardly fit your bed with no real windows, then i strongly advise staying somewhere else. london is full with great hotels. the bathroom is nice as is the breakfast in the morning. bed is comfortable and nespresso machine in the room is a great feature. other than the ridiculously small rooms, it is a good standard hotel.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i booked afternoon tea as a treat for my partner on her birthday. when we arrived we shown to our table, and given two menus, a tea menu, and a champagne menu. the waiter recommended the dorchester tea, which was delicious, a very good choice. next we were served a selection of sandwiches, and the champagne. after that we were served scones, some with dried fruit, and some with jam, all are served with clotted cream. after that came the patisserie, which is one of the reasons i have awarded only three stars. we both thought that the patisserie choices were not as good as we expected, given that we were dining in one of london's premier restaurants. the other reason i awarded three stars was because we had difficulty understanding the waiter, his english was not good enough. this establishment is not cheap which is why my rating is quite harsh. i think that at their prices everything should be just right. also we have had tea in other establishments, and the tea is constantly topped up. during our visit to this restaurant the tea was not topped up which meant that towards the end we were drinking lukewarm tea. in conclusion our afternoon tea experience was not bad, but considering dorchester prices there are better places.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed one night, june 6th 2015. it is expensive (250+ for a fairly standard room). reception staff less than helpful when my wife approached them while i was parking the car (500 yards away..no parking available at the hotel despite my requesting it when i booked). offered upgrade to a room with a river view for another 50+..no thanks. was not particularly impressed that despite the room costing c250 they insisted on taking a payment on my amex of 350 in advance to cover any possible extras. they have an imprint of the card so why do they need to do that? it is an imputation of potential dishonesty on my part that i thought was a bit off. the hotel itself was very nice and comfy. the television in the room did not work. when i mentioned this at checkout the receptionist said: 'oh it is not just your room - it is a problem affecting a large part of the hotel'. no offer of a small discount to make up for it which would have been a nice gesture. when you are paying for anything and charging it to your room there is a 12.5% service charge already added to the bill but there is a space for 'a gratuity', which of course you feel obliged to offer. it is optional of course but it feels like one more way of extracting money from you. we went to the bar 1030pm-ish for a glass or two of champagne. there was a nice unoccupied table for two with a great window view of the thames. when we asked to sit there we were told 'it is been reserved' even though there was no sign on it. it remained unoccupied for about 45-60 minutes until someone turned up and it was offered to them. that is not the way to make a good impression on guests. breakfast was good but very expensive, i thought..40+ for two including the ubiquitous service charge and 'a gratuity'..that is without anything cooked (which did look good i must admit). so it is a well-appointed and comfortable hotel, food and drink pretty good, but it is expensive and for that money they should make the guests feel genuinely welcome, not just like a walking cashpoint. oh yes, one of the senior service in the restaurant at breakfast time was wearing grubby jeans and tatty shoes. did not quite look appropriate.'''",1

The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here on a whim for one night and on the whole, enjoyed the experience. it is in a great location, opposite the oratory and the v&amp;a museum, a short walk to harrods and the natural history museum and great local buses practically on the doorstep that can whizz you to the centre of london in about 15 minutes. all the staff, without exception, were delightful, very welcoming and went out of their way to help. arriving here on spec, i was given a pretty good rate (250 double room, b&amp;b) and shown around the hotel. an ok bar, a massive restaurant, a large lounge with comfortable seats and, for some bizarre reason, two large tv screens which spoiled the relaxing ambience (i guess they must be popular with other guests otherwise why have them?). the decor was a little dated but comfortable enough. my room was on the 4th floor, at the back of the hotel so nice and quiet. large kingsize bed, wardrobe, iron, hairdryer, safe, tea/coffee/biscuits tray, kettle, bottles of water, decent cotton bedding, blackout curtains, television (with plenty of channels including arabic and french) but slightly dated controls (and a very bright blue light which would not switch off at night). a very handy gizmo was a type of smart phone which you could use for calls, internet and info on the local area. bathroom had a large jacuzzi bath, sink, shampoo (no conditioner), shower gel. the bath had hydro jets but these gave me an hell of a shock two hours after my bath when they suddenly started up again (when there is no water in the bath, they are incredibly noisy) top tip: to avoid this happening (apparently it does it automatically), there is a switch inside the wardrobe which will turn the jacuzzi off but probably best to call someone up which i did (they arrived within 2 minutes and once again, a perfect example of how lovely the staff are here). i slept reasonably well, the bed was comfortable and the hotel on the whole was very quiet. room doors do not block out noise though and when they were closed in the corridors, they were rather noisy. breakfast can be taken in your room or in the restaurant. i chose the latter and, having read positive ta reviews, was looking forward to it. unfortunately, it was nothing special. buffet-style: hot plates consisted of fried eggs, scrambled eggs (good quality), bacon (anaemic looking and barely looked cooked), two types of sausages (not good quality), cheese and cold hams (not much choice), small boxes of cereal and muesli and some fresh fruit, although again, not particularly high quality nor variety. bread &amp; croissants looked ok but did not have them so cannot comment. all in all, the breakfast had the feel of a 3 star hotel rather than 4 thus the lower rating. by the way, i have noticed that some raters can give half marks in their ratings (half shaded circles). if i knew how to do it, i would have given this hotel a 3.5! the price, for a central london hotel, was pretty reasonable and there is also a spa next door (swimming pool and gym) which looked rather nice and well-equipped and is included in your stay. on the whole, i would stay here on a bed basis only and get your breakfast at a local cafe. aside from breakfast though, i enjoyed my stay.'''",1

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''firstly' | **disabled / wheelchair users do not book the mandarin oriental** | we stayed for 2 nights in the london mandarin oriental hotel. if we had done the review on the first night we would of rated it only 1 star and we would of gone home the next day if our transport could of been brought forwards. | we asked for a disabled room as i am in a wheelchair, we arrived and was given a room on floor 5. as we were being shown the room we were told that the whole floor is due to be renovated soon and i think people's stay will vary depending on if you are in the new areas or the old (we are not x aware of this being reflected in the price). | we got to the room and there was a little hallway between the bathroom and bedroom which was useful as my wheelchair did not fit into the room or bathroom and so stayed in the hall! it was impossible to get the wheelchair into the bedroom and the bathroom had no grab rails and a low toilet. thankfully i am able to crawl because if i was completely wheelchair bound i could not of stayed there (although i have come home covered in bruises from having to crawl and struggle). the bed was very uncomfortable and the added bed for the 3rd person even had a spring sticking out the side. i found myself reminiscing about a stay in premier inn which was better. we complained but were told the hotel was at 100% capacity so there was nothing that could be done. | we had dinner at bar boulud and despite telling them when booking in advance that i was in a wheelchair i was given a table where i caused an obstruction and was made to feel awkward! | on the second day we were offered a move by a very helpful member of staff, as our first room was on the back and quiet we were not sure whether to take the move or not through fear of getting a room which was even worse but we did in the end decide to move in the hope of being able to get the wheelchair into the room. | we moved to the 1st floor (staff kindly moved all our bags while we were out) and wow, it was like being in a completely different hotel! both the bedroom and bathroom were huge with plenty of space to move around in and i could easily get to the bed in my wheelchair. the room was modern and comfortable plus with a balcony (complete with patio heater) over looking hyde park. | on the 2nd day we ate in the same restaurant and asked for a certain table so i did not feel i was causing a blockage. | over all a mixed stay, i would only recommend staying on the renovated floors and stay away if you are disabled. i was shocked that despite the high room cost there is no free wifi and we had to request a kettle. | thank you to the helpful staff though.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''let us face it the savoy is an icon worldwide let alone in london and probably somewhere everyone aspires to stay. some are lucky enough that they can choose to at anytime, the rest of us it is a rare treat. | we are lucky enough to be able to visit london regularly and usually stay in mayfair given it is proximity to most things we like and green park tube but this was both mine and my wife's birthday so thought we would push the boat out. | make no mistake the savoy is not cheap, it was almost 200.00 dearer than the mayfair, for that you get grandiose iconic splendour and old school first rate service. | we had a room on the second floor and that was a mistake albeit not our choosing, each night between 10pm and 11pm there was a racket from below us and again one morning between 5 and 6am, it may have been from the street below or the refuse or whatever but no amount of understanding can accept that, then on our last night of two at 1pm an unbelievably loud grinding sound woke us up and a visit to reception was required to ask for someone to investigate and have it ceased. not at all acceptable in this quality of establishment. | the only other gripe is that neither bar could accommodate us for a nightcap post theatre or at anytime because our son at 12 was not allowed in, a shame, he knows how to behave but i suppose it is their rule. | we took their afternoon tea, food really good and service first rate but lacked the drama and ultimate specialness of the ritz on piccadilly. | breakfast was excellent albeit i prefer the wolseley if only because despite the original arnold bennett being created at the savoy, the wolseley's is vastly superior. | we would stay again, maybe as a couple to get the full experience and certainly we would expect a better quieter room as a pre requisite but it is hard to justify the extra cost over the mayfair hotels, for which you could treat yourself to the aforementioned alternative venues and have change.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''i am very familiar with the savoy which is one of the great hotels of the world. it has recently reopened and the decor is magnificent, preserving the iconic features of this splendid hotel whilst bringing them up to 21st century expectations. i have used the hotel extensively for banqueting in the past because you could always rely on a perfectly executed meal even when you had upwards of 400 guests for a function but i have been sorely disappointed on the two occasions i have been a guest at functions at the hotel since its opening. hot food that was lukewarm, eggs at a breakfast that were cold with unset white and coffee that does not seem to be the same wonderful savoy blend of old. | bedrooms are amazing and if you have money to blow or even just want an extraordinary one night treat for a lover in london, the savoy is the business.'''",1

"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''i think the wellesley is a decent hotel, but probably needs to think about a few things. on one the hand, the location is amazing, right below hyde park. the hotel also offers a very distinctive cigar lounge, which makes the property a bit unique. however, the road in front of the hotel is quite busy, filled with buses, taxis and the like. as a runner, i enjoyed the convenience to hyde park, but getting to mayfair, soho and the other business districts in the city were not that convenient. the restaurant is quite small and not that warm/comfortable. the hotel does offer access to a fitness centre, but it is not attached to the property. i did not use the facility, so i cannot say how good it was. again, if one enjoys outdoor cross training or running, hyde park is very close. of course, the service staff were very friendly and professional, especially the doorman and check-in personal. no complaints whatsoever. i thought the price per room night for the wellesley was a bit high versus some of the other high quality hotels i have stayed in in london. i also felt the pictures on the website did not quite match my expectation of the room i actually stayed in. there was nothing wrong with the room per se, and the bathroom was surprisingly large. however, the pictures for a junior suite implied a much larger room than was actually the case - a slight annoyance.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''we were treating to a weekend trip to the savoy by our parents. the savoy has such a great reputation we therefore arrived with high expectations. firstly, the reception area is way too small. it is designed to cater for approx 3- 4 groups at any one go. if there are only a few people checking in then the service is very personal and excellent as you get to sit around a large table to check in. if any more and the system falls apart and the service rapdly deteriorated. the staff are proffessional and plentiful so no issues here but we we not fortunate to get a table so we checked in whilst standing in the middle of this large room - strange experience. so, not the special start we had hoped for. we were also promised early check in but on arrival, no rooms were ready so we had to grab some bits from our suitcases and freshen up in the toilets - not expected either. i felt like i was overweight at the check-in desk of an airport and had to open nags in front of everyone. both myself and my mum were on our hands and knees in the middle of the savoy check in area. so, initial impression disappointed. anyway, quickly moving on, we went out of for lunch, afternoon and came back later to go to our rooms. rooms okay, a little bland for such an expensive make over. i appreciate the tv's probably cost around 2k each but feel maybe a cheaper tv could have been specified and the difference to go on some wall art - the rooms lacked any art of decoration to make them feel a little more cosy. food during dinner was superb and once again, plenty of staff on hand although details missing like forgetting to bring more bread when asked etc - just not good enough really. during breakfast, i asked if the home made granola contained any sultanas or raisons. the answer was yes. i then asked if the kitchen would help my by removing these from the home made granola, i appreciate an awkward request but at 8.00 for a small bowl, i thought i would at least ask. have asked in lesser places and the hotel has usually obliged. the waitress then said that the home made granola was in fact in packets! and suggested in body language and tone that it was an absurb request. at this point, i looked at my family and they were in shock at her aggressive attitude. anyway, cut a long story short, she never did come back to me so after 15mins, i called her over and asked if she in fact did ask and her response was 'yes, and they said no' i then suggested bring the granola in the bowl and milk seperately so i could pick them out myself. she said okay but our hot breakfasts were now ready and what was she going to do with my hot meal? - shocking response! - i would expect this in a cafe! anyway, i had my granola, the family had ther hot meals and i then had my hot meal on my own after. this is just not what one would expect. i would have typically complained but it was my fathers treat and i could see he was getting upset so let it be. if it was just me and my wife i would have called the manager over and demanded some reasons why i had received such harsh treatment. anyway, we had a nice weekend but the staff just need another level of training to match the image of the hotel. by the way, my parents have eaten at the savoy grill which is run by gordan ramsey and were most upset - stick to the savoy owned restaurants for great quality food.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i have been in different hotels of this chain and the london version is not the best one..... the bed was not that comfortable, there were some noises from the floor above during the night and it took a long time for me to get the newspaper in the morning..... so i will not return....'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''for the london tourist, the rembrandts location is hard to beat. just down the street are the museums, the royal albert hall, harrods, knightsbridge and also in walking distance, hyde park and chelsea. just a few blocks away is the south kensington tube station, perhaps the most strategic tube stop in london for tourists. the piccadilly line west takes you to heathrow. take it eastbound just a few stops to the central tourist areas: hyde park corner (buckingham palace), piccadilly circus (regent street), leicester square (west end theatres and half price ticket window), and covent garden (opera house and market), the district line takes you out to wimbledon or up to bayswater (good ethnic restaurants) and paddington station (train to heathrow). the circle line, also from south kensington goes to victoria station, westminster (cathedral and parliament), charing cross (trafalgar square and the national galleries), london bridge and the tower of london. almost any other london attraction can be reached with a single connection. | that said, my stay was for business and not for touring. location benefits aside, i would consider the rembrandt to be a very weak example of a 4-star establishment. the rooms are adequately sized for a london hotel. but the decor feels rather dated. the flat screen tv is a tad small. the guest rooms are situated such that the bedroom is adjacent to the hallway, making it rather noisy. with the aid of drugs, the noise did not bother me but i do know that it would have kept my lighter sleeping wife up a good part of the night had she been with me. the wireless internet service is free, fast with has a good strong signal. but it has the annoying habit of logging you off at random moments while you are in the middle of your work, forcing you to go through the log in process again and again. the gym, more important perhaps to business travelers, is not actually part of the hotel. you will have to go next door and buy a day pass at a private facility. i am cannot be sure how typical this is, but i had bad experiences trying to find an available taxi i in front of the hotel in the am rush hour. | the breakfast buffet, highly acclaimed in other reviews, i found disappointing. judged by us hotel standards, it is clearly superior. but by uk and european standards, it was wanting. with the exception of a selection of apples and melon slices, all the fruits offered were canned. the fried egg tray always seemed empty. the selection of cold cuts was limited and unappealing in appearance (also no smoked salmon, an immediate indication to me of less-than-4 star quality). and the selection of breads included no whole grain or multi-grain choices. | in summary i might suggest this hotel to someone coming to london for the sights. i might steer a business traveler elsewhere.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''they take 100 from your credit card and 3 days later it is not back in my account. i think this is disgraceful, i understand taking an imprint for incidentals but i have never had money taken from my account before at check in. the receptionist was borderline rude when i questioned this practice. it would put me of staying here again. | the location was great and comfortable well equipped rooms. the staff in the rumpus room were lovely.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''my room was small but comfortable. one major issue was a steep slope leading into the bathroom. i nearly fell a few times during the course of my stay. the neighborhood is lovely and the hotel is directly across from the v&amp;a museum and close to a tube stop. i prefer other neighborhoods in london due to convenience of shops. there are not many places to eat a reasonably priced meal within walking distance. also, it should be noted that there are no vending machines in the hotel. there is 24 hr room service and a mini bar, but i prefer to spend less than $5 for a diet coke. hotel is within walking distance of harrods and other major department stores, so if high end shopping is your thing, this hotel is great. for me, not so much.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we thought that a few days away in this beautiful hotel was what we needed. but it fell very short on festive fun. christmas day dinner priced at 195. per person was over priced with one slice of white meat and one if dark four tiny parsnips about two inches and looked liked small french fries three small roast potatoes and three brussels cut in half. pretty tasteless too. desserts were not much better i sent mine back and had xmas pudding which was nice. but the restaurant lacked any atmosphere with no candles or table decorations other than a christmas cracker. | the breakfasts were also disappointing, seeming not possible to gave grilled not oven baked or fried with oil ( i asjed for grilled on two separate | occasions and still got the same as my husband. | all public areas were used for either afternoon tea breakfast so no where to relax and read a book other than on sofa in reception seating about six people and always full. so overall very disappointing.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''it is not optimal since it does not have toilets or showers in the rooms, but it is an okay place if you are in london and want a cheap place to sleep with a good location. there is a lot of noise from the street below, and the rooms are quite easy to hear through the walls, but over all a nice place to stay.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''a large hotel in whitehall, the reception areas are lovely and quite grand, but lack something that would give this hotel its own identity. | staff are perfectly polite - impeccable, but focus was 'service' with a capital s (nothing wrong with that) rather than me as their guest ... i guess that is more difficult to achieve with such a large hotel. room service food was excellent. | gripes? | 1) bathroom lighting not good enough to apply makeup (i ended up sitting on the floor in the bedroom in front of the window) | 2) could not adjust the room temperature (max 21, if you want higher reception do it for you downstairs, but in the morning we could not turn the temp down so we switched it off) | 3) i kind of resent walking through the harrods concession shop to get to breakfast (walking past is ok, not through) | 4) the bed was a bit too firm for me | 5) i struggled a bit with the buffet breakfast - i get breakfast brought to me in a malmaison. | .... overall, nothing really wrong with this hotel, it is all 5*, but i was just a little underwhelmed'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i booked this hotel because it was ideally located for a two day stay with my stepson. directly opposite the v &amp; a and just a short walk to the science museum and natural history, and an even shorter walk to south kensington tube station. so from that point of view it served its purpose. | however check-in was a shambles, first of all they did not confirm the booking and when i phoned to ensure they had the booking on the day before departure they said they could not tell me and i would have to phone back the next day to check as reservations was closed on a sunday! on arrival they gave me a standard room instead of executive and then with a double bed, not two singles. the room was newly refurbished to the point that the shower had never been used (or tested) and did not work. i called housekeeping and they could not get it to work either and after much puzzlement there was a comedy moment when it suddenly started working and they ended up getting soaked. | we did not dine there apart from breakfast and i felt we were given second class treatment by the waiters - being asked to wait for a table when others were shown through and then given a table nearest the exit both times. the food on offer was plentiful but not great in terms of quality or imagination. | the beds were very comfortable and the room was quiet. however, if it was not for the location i would not recommend staying here because for the same price you can stay somewhere a bit special, whereas the rembrandt is average throughout.'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''our stay was quite comfortable and we enjoyed the large spacious ' deluxe room' with bathroom. the hotel is well located within walking distance of harrods and the underground. it is surrounded by many good restaurants of all price ranges. | hotel service is best described as off hand for a hotel of this professed standard and assistance on the sidewalk on arrival and with baggage is missing. there is no doorman. | breakfast is institutional and disappointing. better value is available outside the hotel. | decor and ambience is aged and some new colours and modernisation would be appropriate to lift what could be a fine property.''',1
The Dorchester,"'''i stayed here with my wife and children prior to travelling on to the eurostar (provided a good quality service as an aside) whilst the hotel itself was nice, the service was a let down with the room service hap making us feel very uncomfortable. we asked for some dental product and after 3 requests still never received this through the evening into the morning. if you are willing to throw your money about then they will probably give you as much service as possible if you want to treat yourself as we did then look somewhere else.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''a group of us visited here to eat at kaspars. the service was brilliant, and could not be criticised. the food was just average for london, it did not have the wow factor and i expected the standard to be slightly higher. slightly disappointed and ridiculously overrated!'''",1
The Dorchester,'''i had the highest expectations on this five star property. | sadly the priority went to the international arrogance who paid the same dollars as i. example - elevator was blocked waiting for some sudo important person - problem is they only have two elevators - oh my gosh! | the property is older and i am sorry just not worth the cash.''',1
Newham Hotel,"'''for sure, this hotel will not be my best hotel where i sleep. but he is well located, breakfast ok, cleaning ok, a little bit noisy, the shower was broken. but the price is okay for london. | the hotel is at only 12 min far from liverpool street by train and 7 min from forest gate by foot.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i am afraid it was a bit of a disappointment, we ate in the thames foyer and arrived as they were clearing breakfast, that was not a problem and we order fish and chips, which was delivered around noon and was delicious. it went downhill from there, the staff had disappeared and i had to ask for desert menu. our desert ordered my ""pudding"" arrived and my daughters didm't again we had to ask what was going on. as mine was a hot meal i had to eat mine while we waited at least 5 minutes for two scoops of ice cream to arrive! | i am afraid it was a disappointment, i would also recommend not using top table to book a table as the foyer was empty and according to top table 11:15 was the only time available.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we spent 5 nights fall vacation at the rembrandt. the location is excellent and quite peaceful despite the construction all around. the hotel craves an overhaul to justify its 4****. the bar/lounge is gloomy, depressing. apparently no restaurant (?). the wall to wall carpeting goes back to john lennon. the club rooms are perfect for a small family. however, you need to insist on a true king size bed and an 'honest' mattress. we were moved to a decent room after spending a night of horror in room 666 (!). the bathrooms are jour and nice. internet reception is good. the price for the accommodation (from 214) is fair when you ""eat all you possibly can"" at the included breakfast buffet. the staff is friendly... as long as you do not voice critique and/or have special requests (e.g. children's meals). it is basically run like a ***cruise ship. the individual traveler should look further. beware at checkout as they do not provide supporting documentation for charges and bill phone calls you never made.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we went for ""high tea"" here with another couple, and our initial reception was delightful. the staff were courteous and helpful, and the first course (variety of sandwiches) and a wide selection of teas was lovely. however, our table was next to the bar entrance so we had a continual stream of people coming and going. things went sadly downhill after the first course. the scrambled egg and smoked salmon took 45 minutes to arrive - we had to prompt two members of staff to chase it. the 3rd course crumpets were poorly cooked - they appeared to have been toasted only on one side, and the final course of ""signature cake"" was more appropriate to accompanying a mug of tea after an afternoon gardening than a high end tea at 52.50 per person. meanwhile the teas became rather tepid and bitter despite being ""refreshed"", and the pianist played a selection of jazz-style improvisations that we failed to recognise. the afternoon was saved from ignominy by the helpful waiter offering us a selection of pastries when we commented about the cake.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''location is very close to paddington, hyde park, oxford st. | victorian buildings that despite best efforts show their age. the hotel manager is exceptionally customer focussed and goes out of his way to help, and the breakfast and cleaning staff similarly. | basic rooms and amenities. breakfast very basic and cooked items are extra cost. | we stayed at a premier inn on the same visit for the same cost. in terms of the experience, one felt like a modern hotel, modern amenities, excellent breakfast and staff. rhodes felt like a family run hotel, where everyone was making a best effort, breakfast was not anywhere near as good and rooms felt small and the environment dated. it is a personal preference and given that most people will be out all day seeing the london sights, really just comes down to location.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''spent what i was hoping would be a higher end couples weekend but was somewhat disappointed. while the common areas are quite grand, the rooms are in dire need of a refresh and the general atmosphere is somewhat geriatric. staff and service is top | notch though but i feel this place just lives off its reputation of yesteryear. i come to | london a lot and quite frankly, the langham and the dorchester are in another league.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i like to stay in nice hotels. i do it often. i stayed at the mondrian in la for 12 days, and was hoping for the same level of hotel here in london. i was so disappointed with our room. the tv did not work, they sent someone up to fix it... it still did not work when we came back that night. our view was of a rooftop below... and i had not paid for a basic room... the bed was not the best but most of all the room was tiny, and nothing special at all. i might as well have been in a travel lodge. | we also ate dinner. dinner was very nice, as was the bar... cool people watching, and lovely cocktails. | we were so disappointed however with the whole stay. | we did get an apology re. the tv at checkout but that was it. | there are better hotels in this price bracket.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''could not fault the staff or the cleanliness of the hotel. however, for me the location was not good as public transport not the best during the day. no direct buses to central london. nearest tube about 15 minutes away. room was small and even though had a black out curtain, it let the sun in. did not eat there as food over priced for what it is. sainsburys next door, a big bonus.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we were at the v &amp; a and just had to drop in for a drink in the rembrandts lovely lounge which is like an old gentlemen's club. we had stayed there a few years ago and thought why not give it a go considering it was mid afternoon and would not be too busy. after ordering our two drinks and snack, we waited another 20-25 mintues for a pint of beer and a still water to appear. we finished our drinks completely forgetting about the snack and about 30 mins after the drinks appeared the snack showed. by now we realized why we stopped staying there. the smarter guests just shrugged and got up and left.'''",1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we arrived at xenia hotel just after 2pm after walking around 10 minutes from the tube station (gloucester road). we were greeted by the doormen but were not shown to the front desk which we had to look for ourselves. the receptionist was not as welcoming as we would have liked and my partner had to speak first to her. however, we were well informed about the facilities in the hotel, given a 15% off voucher on the food and drink for booking online, and told where our room (number 104). the room looked very clean and the bathroom was spotless. we had read previous reviews on the hotel so were not surprised on how small the room was. we dropped our bags off and went straight out into london. we were not back unti midnight where we were hoping to be able to go straight to sleep. however, when i pulled the covers back there were numerous stains and even a genital hair on the mattress! part of the sheet was ripped and there was an uncomfortable draught blowing through the vents. my partner went down to the front desk to complain after having taken photos on his ipad of the stains. at first the concierge tried to argue that we put the atains there as otherwise we would have come down earlier. after explaining to him that we had been out all day and had only just got back, he apologised and moved us to another room (114). this was bigger and had a balcony with no extra charge. this room was spotless and i thank the staff for being so prompt in moving us. the facilities in both room were exceptional with complimentary water, tea, biscuits and of course the tablet and tv which were both very useful! i slept well but my partner who is a lighter sleeper than i said there were loud bangs throughout the night coming from downstairs in the hotel. | we were not told about the whereabouts of the games room which we had to find ourselves, and then it was closed. it would have been useful to have some information about the games room and its opening times. | overall, the hotel was lovely but the cleanliness could be greatly improved. for 145/ night, i would have expected spotless rooms.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here for three nights recently for a city break. the hotel is situated in a perfect location, 5 mins walk from south kensington tube, 2 mins walk from lots of delightful delis and cafes, and 1 min from the natural history museum and science museum. | on arrival they demanded a credit card for items to be charged to. i said i would pay as i go in the bar, they would not allow this. i did not have a credit card and they insisted on charging my card 50 up front in case i wanted any extras. i have never had this at any other hotel. they then refunded my card on departure. | the room was small as most in london are, the bathroom tiny. i could touch all 4 walls standing in the middle. but it was clean, and the room had good facilities and was decorated well. | the bed was amazing. king size and very comfortable. i slept very well throughout my stay. i would go as far to say it was the most comfortable bed i have ever slept on. | breakfast was delicious and a huge range on offer. the waiters were very good and polite. | on departure the staff took payment, handed me the receipt and said ""so, here you go"". and that was it. no mention of asking whether we had enjoyed our stay, and thank you for staying with us. all a bit rude i felt given the amount of money we had spent. | all in all the hotel was fine. i probably would not stay there again as there are many others to try out next time, and it did not have a wow factor that made me want to return.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i went there with a group of friends last weekend. the decor and atmosphere were outstanding. the piano playing was really nice. the china and tea served were wonderful. the concierge were friendly and actually very funny too. the down side was they kept bringing sandwiches and sandwiches when we had ordered high tea - scrambled eggs and smoked salmon which was very nice. the real disappointment for me was the cakes. big slabs of chocolate cake, big eclairs , nothing small and dainty at all. for example there were no little iced sponge cakes with delicate icing. it is not like they do not have an in house chocolatier. so that and having to continually look for someone to top up the tea was a bit annoying as they do not give you the tea pot. so 3 out of 5. i think we will be going ing somewhere else next time.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''my husband and i recently stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. | first impression - the lobby, bar and public areas are in excellent shape, but small. | staff - i cannot say enough about how wonderful the staff was. definitely the highlight of this hotel. | restaurant - breakfast is a buffet each morning with a very wide selection. everything was very good. we never had lunch or dinner there. | location - we felt the neighborhood was very safe. we were within walking distance to harrods, a few museums and many restaurants. the tube station is a 5 minute walk and the stop for the ""big bus"" is a 2 minute walk. however, for the sights that we wanted to see this was not the most ideal location. | rooms - unfortunately we were very disappointed in our room. the rooms are small and dark. the furnishings and bedding are very worn. we booked the executive level and i am honestly not sure whether or not we actually received it as the rooms we saw looked nothing like the picture on the website. after check-in and seeing our room we did go back to the front desk to see if we had been given the right room and 3 rooms later we were still in the same type of room. the room was kept clean, but i found it disappointing compared to the rest of the hotel.'''",1

"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''very new hotel. difficult to imagine but most of london cabbies did not know where it was!! the hotel is located in a refurbished classic building just moments from main attractions of knighstbridge. the interior is an expensive art deco style, the owners spent a lot of money for sure. the stuff is friendly and mostly helpful. sometimes even too much. we had a breakfast in a breakfast room and we were alone there (!!) 3 waiters made circles around and it was a bit not relaxing. the main negative impression was our room when we came in. it was like a doggy bag - so small ! it happens in london but not for this price. we were so upset and talked to the reception and they finally offered us a suite. the suite was of a good size - not huge but very comfortable, but it had a window only in the bed area and this window faced a wall !! so if you go try to avoid a ""normal"" room, maybe if you are alone only. but the regular price for a suite is very high and you still have a wall in fornt of your window. | service is generally on a good level, concierge job was good and they offer you a complimentary rolls royce service, you can go around for app. 5 miles, but better to book it in advance, a lot of people wants to try of course. | the main problem is a hotel web site which does not show the real size of the rooms.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we stayed 4 nights at this conveniently located, clean hotel. we asked to stay on a lower floor as there is no lift and our request was attended to. the reception staff was pleasant and helpful. the room was tiny but quite adequate for our needs. it had a large tv and the included wifi was particularly reliable and fast. there was an added bonus of a small fridge. the bathroom was very clean and, although contained in a very small area, it had everything that was needed. there is some interesting blue lighting in the bathroom.there was good water pressure and plenty of hot water. the exhaust fan switch is located above the door which could be a little hard to reach for some people. the breakfast was served in a small dining room and was served by a friendly female chef. you could pay extra for a full breakfast but the continental breakfast was quite adequate for us. the owner of the hotel is a jovial character who is clearly eager to provide good service to hotel guests. the fantastic location of this small hotel is a real plus. it is only a short walk from hyde park and 2 tube stations. the added bonus is the proximity to paddington station and the heathrow express and the heathrow connect service ( a cheaper option at 9 pounds) there is also a number of well priced restaurants around the corner. overall, we had a great stay at this well priced small hotel. do not expect big rooms, though!'''",1
The Savoy,"'''second time we have stayed here this year after the refit and we where underwhelmed:- | room - nice but close to stair door which banged during the night and woke us up several times. | men's spa - asked at reception if the steam room was open and was told to pop up there and see if it was - sure enough had to waste time to go up there to find out it is closed. | not what you expect paying 750 pounds a night. | american bar - turned me away as a resident for wearing converse trainers at 2 pm in the afternoon, i went upstairs and simply swapped shoes and then was allowed in - what a waste of time in this day and age..... | beaufort bar - beautiful and stunning if you are 65 and do not dare to have a laugh. we where celebrating a business award and my husband was mingling and socialising with clients we had brought here to celebrate the prize- we spent 2,000 on champagne in less than an hour and then the maitre d told one of our employees in front of clients that he would not serve another bottle to the group, without any warning to my husband. as far as we where aware the only crime we where committing was standing up in the bar...... | you do not get treated like this at claridges or the berkeley who have exceptional service and we will be spending our money there in the future. | breakfast - average with a lengthy wait.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the hotel has a great location, and we had a lovely view of st paul's from our room...however we were woken up at 2 a.m by very loud hot water pipe noises (banging and whistling sounds). we turned the taps on and off and thought it had worked. but about 10 mins later it started again. we called reception and someone did come up and they heard the sound and said they would call an engineer! after a short while the noise eventually stopped. at checkout i was expecting reception to apologise as surely they would of had a note on their screen of the issue, but no.....not a word. i mentioned it and the young lady was surprised. this is not ideal customer service for a modern hotel with great reviews, and as it was our 1st wedding anniversary (paid 250 not the secret escapes offer which i saw a month after booking by the way 150) we were disappointed. we decided not to take breakfast in the hotel as pricey and as were so tired we wanted to get some fresh air and ventured to the close cafe nero. seen another review with similar incident so thought i needed to get our experience included and hopefully the hotel managers will sort out the plumbing issue! or at least apologise. will not be going back.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''yes, it is a basic hotel. no, do not expect ant ""airs or graces"". this hotel is certainly fit for purpose. my son and i stayed here friday and saturday last week. the reception staff were polite enough and the breakfast staff even more so. we were in a ground floor twin room which was a good size with a pretty decent sized shower room and quite clean. an errant cobweb in a hard to reach corner, but that was it. be aware that this hotel is on the main road, so expect some traffic noise if in a front bedroom. comfortable bed, you only get one pillow, and the usual tea, coffee, tv, hair-drier. breakfast is served buffet style, but you can stuff yourself silly, with plenty of coffee and tea available. breakfast on the sunday morning was ruddy hectic, so get in early! do not forget that breakfast is included in the price and that you do not have to pay extra for parking!! maybe not the most desirable area of london, but that is reflected in the price that you pay. we would stay here again if ever going to the queen elizabeth(olympic)stadium.'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''best is location! we upgraded to a king size bed but it was not very comfortable! the pillows ( all 6 of them) were like rocks! dining room at night should be avoided unless it is raining or snowing...we were the only 2 in a very large dining room. i will say that the food was good though. breakfast was fine but coffee was mostly lukewarm they could use a self serve coffee stand. i think this is an average hotel for london but again the location gives it a plus!''',1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we arrived to helpful reception staff and had booked into a classic double room. overall i would say the service was good. i have stayed in many hotels worldwide and i have to say this is the smallest hotel room i have ever been in. their classic doubles are 10 or 12 metres square. the bed was a small double with just enough room to walk along the side and the tv was wall mounted but on the perpendicular wall (i.e no tv watching in bed and no where else to sit to watch tv). the bathroom was so small that the wash hand basin overlapped the toilet. i think they have actually divided a normal sized room in half - smaller than my university dorm room! no coffee or tea making facilities. i think we lasted all of 30 seconds in the room and requested an upgrade. we were upgraded at a cost of 100 extra to a deluxe room - this gave us a saving of about 70 on the full price of the roomok but not great. this was a nice room, but given that this is the best room in the hotel below the suite, it was still on the small side. there was a coffee machine however. the bathroom was small. the shower was narrow and i banged my elbows against the glass a few times. water pressure in the shower was not great. the buffet breakfast was poor and again no room in the breakfast room (12). the room service food we ordered was cold and not particularly nice (burger). the drinks are astoundingly expensive.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this is a hotel in london with reasonable rates, though i was a little disappointed after reading the other reviews. | london is an expensive city, so i did not expect anything more than bare-bones, basic, dated accommodations, which describes this hotel. perhaps we had bad luck, but lifting up the sheets, the mattress needed some vacuuming. the main negative was the noise level. it was a hot night so we had to keep the windows open, and it was difficult to sleep. | the breakfast was a plate with eggs, beans and bacon. | overall, i would probably still recommend the hotel due to the location and overall, it was satisfactory. | on a practical note, the british museum is the closest attraction and the hotel is right by the university of london. it is a 10 minute walk to a few different tube stations on different lines. the immediate vicinity does not have too many shops or restaurants, but there is a grocery store about 5 minutes away. you either need to ring the bell or use your key to get into the front door, so there was an added sense of security, which was nice.'''",1
The Savoy,'''stunning property with great history and an opportunity to step back in time. good choice of on site dining and bars so well worth a visit. down side was the room.. deluxe king river view room... no tea or coffee making facilities. dated decor with very basic amenities and functionality. service from the front of house very commendable... can get more value in another property in london.''',1
Ridgemount Hotel,'''my husband and i stayed at the ridgemount in september 2004. we had a double en-suite room. the room was clean but not somewhere you would want to spend a lot of time in. the bedspreads really need replacing. | | the location is pretty good but the street outside is quite noisy all day and all night. i would say it is more like a 10 minute walk to either tube station. there are restaurants nearby. | | the hosts are quite nice and provide lots of good information. the breakfast is good and filling. | | it is an okay value for the money but i do not think we would stay here again. we stayed at a b&amp;b in 2001 for the same cost which was much nicer.''',1
The Savoy,"'''i just checked out of the savoy; we stayed at the property the past four days over the christmas holidays. the hotel is very nice with interesting architecture and well-appointed interiors. this is true of both the common areas as well as the guest rooms. our room was a deluxe room with two double beds (we were not upgraded as many who have published reviews were, but we did arrive about two hours before check-in, so i certainly was not expecting that even though i am a president's member). the staff are all very friendly as well. upon check-in, the staff member was able to find us a room without much wait even though we were early. however, we had to wait about 50 minutes between the time we were given a room and when our bags arrived. this was annoying and unfortunately a sign of service issues to come. i hate to try to come up with excuses for this property, but it seems as if during the holidays, they were likely operating with a smaller staff who were not as well-trained as one would expect. regardless, there are a lot of great things about the property - the american bar is quite nice and the staff are lovely. additionally, we enjoyed the christmas day tea service very much - the staff again were wonderful. also, the tea and scones were very enjoyable. the finger sandwiches and other desserts were not as tasty, but fine nonetheless. finally, the beds were quite comfortable. | unfortunately, the negatives we experienced because me to rate the property a three. to begin with, we selected this property primarily because of the pool area; in london during the holidays, very little outside of the shops are open on december 24 and 26, and nothing is open on december 25. having access to the spa, pool, and fitness area on those days was therefore a deciding factor in our choice for a hotel. the pool was open as scheduled on the 24th. however, on the 25th, the pool did not open until well after 4 pm. the pool was supposed to open at 8 am. i arrived a little after 8 to be told there was an accident and the pool would be closed for about 30 minutes. thirty minutes became a few hours, which became a few more hours, which became a few more hours. i do not know what the accident was, and i certainly do not blame the hotel for the accident, but i do blame them for not being able to deal with it in a timely manner. on the 26th, i again went down to the pool when it was supposed to open at 8 am, and it was locked. i called reception, and they told me the tube strike caused some of their workers issues in getting to the property that day. they said they would try to find someone to open the fitness area for me and would call to let me know what that was accomplished. no call ever came. | for those like me who are looking for a pool/spa property, i would say that the fixtures are very nice and high-end. however, both the pool and spa areas (including the steam room and sauna) are quite small. if there are more than two or three adults, the pool would be quite crowded; with children splashing about it would be worse. i simply mention this to those who focus on this property for the use of these facilities. | another reason i think we had the f staff team is that housekeeping kept disturbing us. as mentioned above, we spent most of the 25th at the unopened pool reading. when we went back to our room at 3pm to get ready for tea, our room had not been serviced. the maid knocked shortly thereafter, and i informed her that we would be leaving for tea by about 4:15. every 20 minutes, she seemed to knock again. after the third time, i told her we will not be leaving our room until 4:15 and chained the door so we would not have to deal with the interruptions! finally, we also had the seemingly obligatory phantom mini-bar charges. | i do not know; i really wanted to like this hotel because it is quite beautiful and elements are very nice. i just think that possibly because of the holidays either staff were brought in to fill the gaps or we got the f team. regardless, we will not be back because i do not think it is acceptable for service levels to be so inconsistent of a property that is this expensive. | ps - one other important point for the ladies - the water is super soft, even in the shower.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed here for 2 nights, we had originally thought about 3 nights &amp; were glad we did not &amp; that was nothing to do with the terror attack. the stay was average considering it is supposed to be a 5 star hotel. a plus point was the location of the hotel as we had booked the globe theatre &amp; the roh. the porters were very helpful, reception did their best but because our room was booked by a friend it soon became a bit of a farce. we arrived early &amp; did not expect the room to be ready anyway but they said they would get it done as a priority. we put our cases in our friends room &amp; went to breakfast. whilst the food was what you can get at a greasy spoon, a fry up, the service was at best slapdash over the next 2 mornings. water was served, a menu was presented &amp; tea/coffee was supplied. breakfast had on the first day. there was confusion over the bill, we were charged for 2 hot breakfasts when my wife had a cold breakfast. the next day it got worse, we were seated, so far so good, no water supplied, no menu supplied, we did get some tea/coffee. again it was a farce with the bill mixing us up yet again. next day, no water offered we had to ask again, no menu &amp; confusion with the bill. why not have a procedure with the restaurant staff, train them to be consistent with service? we got to our room after going on a river cruise. we saw our friends had a complimentary mobile in their room but we had no such thing. i asked about it at reception &amp; she did not understand what i was talking about as she wrongly assumed we had one. we were only given 1 swipe card even though there were 2 of us, not a major issue but they could have asked if we needed a second one. i think a lot needs to be done to improve service in certain areas.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel is located directly across from the entrance to the v&amp;a and a few minutes walk from hyde park and kensington gardens. it seems to be very popular with tourists and breakfast was quite crowded and noisy. lots of closet space in the room, which can be helpful on family vacations. the building itself seems quite old and must have been refurbished, but the plumbing was quite bad. local restaurants and shops are a few hundred meters away towards the tube stop.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed there for two nights and was very much looking forward to it. my special conference rate was high, even for london standards. on the plus side was the service, not to be faulted other than very noisy cleaning ladies in the hallway at 7 am. on the negative side was the state of the room and the hotel generally. it is just a bit run down, not fresh. as an example, the bathroom was old, small and not very clean. the shower - in the bath - had mildew. the smoke detector had not been cleaned for clearly a very long time. small things, but for this hotel group i would think not acceptable given the rates.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''the hotel was spectacular and all the facilities were of an excellent standard but it is the little things that make it extra memorable and sadly these were lacking and we were turned away from the bar as apparently you had to book a table yes even in a cocktail bar and even when we had booked four bedrooms for the weekend. probably it was mentioned in the fine print but mondrian you blew it and not only that but we were made to feel very uncomfortable...''',1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the location is great. walk right onto the thames and only about a 10 minute walk from london eye, borough market, etc. the hotel is contemporary, which often results in over-investment in cutting edge design and under-investment in functionality and comfort. however, the room was large and comfortable with a spacious bathroom. there is an oversized sink basin that takes up too much space. however, despite that, there was plenty of shelf space to store you toiletries. only 2 towels in the bathroom. too much of a headache to request more. the hallways are very dark. the room was very quiet, which was lovely. you certainly do not feel ""special"" as a guest there, despite it is far star rating. it was a good deal on kayak for the property though in summer, so that is why i selected it. it has a hip trendy rooftop bar that i did not go to, as i was with my son. however, looked like a lot of fun and certainly a hip vibe.. i would stay at this hotel again if the rate is a great value. overall, it does not have a luxurious vibe. however, it is a nice hotel. just does not meet my criteria as a 5 star.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''first let me state that the service and people at the hotel is wonderful. friendly, responsive, everything you would hope for in a hotel. unfortunately, the hotel does not deliver the value you would expect from fairmount or any hotel at this price level. on two separate mornings, in two different rooms, i had not hot water. that is a crappy way to start a day. seriously, this is just not acceptable; motel 8 can give you hot water. | perhaps it is a london thing, but the bathroom seemed cramped. there was no separate shower and the bathtub had no curtain, only a half length plastic water guard along the side of the tub. hence, lots of water (cold) around the bathroom after the shower. | the breakfast restaurant was good, but also very expensive. and charging 10 pounds a day for wireless connection seems mercenary at this price point. overall great people, clean lovely hotel, but otherwise meh.'''",1
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of the ritzy toney london area and if you love the smell of cigars, then you have found your ""go to"" hotel in london as the very small lobby, bar and restaurant area is consumed with the cigar bar and you cannot escape the smoke smell even in the elevators and on at least the first couple of floors. when i mentioned it to the front desk personnel almost in passing, the response was ""well, we are expanding the cigar bar,"" so clearly they did not smell my drift. but for that issue (and in all fairness i cannot stand cigar smoke--worse than cigarette smoke for me) i would give the hotel a 4 or even 5 rating as the rooms are nice, showers great, bathroom spaciouscomplete with a business cleaning toiletand the staff very accommodating and professional.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''having visited the dandelyan bar a number of times i was on the lookout for a good deal at the hotel, which i managed to obtain. | the rooms themselves are a minimal mix of traditional and modern aspects, for some reason i was given an accessible room (not sure why) which i am guessing may have been a little larger than other rooms in the hotel. | the communal areas of the hotel are large and stylish, in so much as i felt extremely at home around the hotel whilst never feeling over crowded, even on a saturday evening in the rumpus room when i returned after the theatre. the bars in the hotel are great, however i wish they would serve the same cocktails in the rumpus room as they do in dandelyan, but then again i suppose the rumpus room has the draw of the view. | breakfast was a decent buffet with all you could really wish for and the added bonus it could be enjoyed by the thames. | the only downside i would say would be check in/out. now i know that asking for a pre authorisation on a card is general rule nowadays but not a necessity. i prefer not to do this as i do not use a credit card and therefore a pre authorisation puts a hold on funds in my current account for a few days (and as a student this is not really an option for me) at check in they had a major issue with the fact i preferred not to leave a 100 per night pre authorisation (which is excessive in comparison to other properties) , which resulted in them going backwards and forwards to the manager and finally agreeing that they would not take the payment but they would remove the mini bar. i agreed to this only to find that when my partner had gone down to reception the same day to discuss obtaining a receipt for the room (as i was checking out a day later than him) they had told him they needed to complete a pre authorisation and sneakily took the payment from him! however, even after doing this they failed to return the mini bar! | to top it off, upon checkout when i asked for the receipt my partner had agreed with them i was informed they could not issue this as i had booked through a 3rd party, even though my partner had fully discussed this with them at the time he completed the pre authorisation and they assured him i would be able to obtain a receipt. to me, for a 5 star this service is not really what one would expect and my review has been affected by this experience!'''",1
The Savoy,"'''as someone who lives in the middle east and regularly stays at luxury properties throughout the world, you get used to a certain level of service from 5* establishments, unfortunately i feel the savoy are resting on their laurels, and hoping their name carries them forward. | we were allocated a room in the art deco wing which had clearly been unoccupied for some time as it smelt musty and damp. now i am well aware of the hotel's history, but keeping hotel rooms smelling fresh should not be that difficult, i have stayed in 16th century castles that smell nicer... after a few phone calls we were moved to the edwardian wing which was much nicer. | the room itself was small, not enough room to even open both our suitcases, again this cannot be helped in a historic hotel, but is worth noting for anyone who likes their space... | what really let our stay down was the attitude of staff. it was very clear that we were viewed as ""one time guests"". i can only imagine because we are a young couple, and only when we returned from a day of shopping laden with luxury bags did we get a ""welcome to the savoy"" from the front of house staff. at all other times we were completely ignored. | breakfast was another lackluster affair, on both mornings of our stay we were not greeted or shown to a seat, we had to wait a good 10 minutes for menus and had to ask for coffee (there were only 2 other tables occupied). the waiter on both mornings was clearly in a bad mood, i could not work out if it was his general french upper class demeanor, or if he would just had a bad night's sleep... but we had to call the waiter over to order, to which he merely replied ""yes"", and then call the waiter over again to clear our plates and ask for the cheque... again in restaurants of this caliber, i usually expect the waiter to be able to judge when we would like to order, and when we have finished... | overall, if you are a young couple, i would not stay here, unless you are overly obvious about your wealth...'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i have stayed here before but mainly i am a longstanding and regular user of the hotel's various dining and drinks venues. the promenade was always great for pre and post dinner drinks but more recently it has disappointed, with awkward rules for non residents and no matter how busy or quiet, it always seems problematic to get a table without some fuss and ultimately then being seated. also, the nibbles served used to be excellent with superb almond stuffed olives and other lovely accompaniments, fitting with a genuine five start property, however this has all been downgraded and now one receives a bowl of crisps and cheap nuts - small thing but as regulars one notices and cost cutting seems unnecessary/irritating at this level. service can be great and other times lacks personality and consistency. overall good but not like it used to be.'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''hi | i recently stayed here for a work conference. i was given an executive room at the front of the hotel. first impression was the room was clean and bright. disappointingly the bed consisted of two single beds pushed together. they were old and the support was not great. the in room tv was very small. the shower in the bathroom was good and contained good pressure and a nice hot temperature. the room also came with an iron and ironing board which were important. | the noise level was tough as the room was in the front of the hotel so you could hear the traffic outside until 1am and it started again at 05.30am. it was tough to get a good nights sleep. | the breakfast the following morning was very average. i tried the porridge and it was awful...it contained barely any oats and was bulked out with water...tasteless gruel. i would question if the chef himself ever even tried it to be honest. i should have complained there and then but i was running a little behind after the poor nights sleep! the selection of breads was only a brown and white sliced pan. most hotels now do freshly baked bread that one can slice oneself to get a good slice of crusty toast. the coffee was average as well. for the second day i went around the corner to the le pain quotidien cafe which is close to south kensington tube station and is close by. they have lovely coffee and freshly prepared tasty scrambled eggs! i am sorry to say that this hotel was charging 190 sterling per night and presents itself as an upmarket 4 star hotel. i have stayed in much better more modern places in london recently that offer much better value for money in my opinion.''',1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''a friend and i stayed in the rhodes hotel for two nights. upon arrival, we were told the two-person rooms were fully booked so they upgraded us to a three-person room on the attic of their annex building. this room was tiny but adequate for us as we really only slept there. the mini-bathroom had recently been renovated and was clean, but the carpet in the room itself was stained, as was the bed cover. no ac, so we were happy it was not too warm outside for it would have been very stuffy. for the second night they would move us to a two-person room. when we arrived there, it was a closet-size room with one 1.20m bed - even though we indicated the first night we would need a twin! this was disappointing, but reception could not do anything for us as the hotel was fully booked. they also implied that we booked a double and it was basically our own fault (not true, our online reservation mentioned that the room would be for two persons and have two separate beds). all in all, the staff was friendly and the location was great - very close to paddington station - but we found the hotel did not meet our expectations as it was very old and cramped.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''i thought my experience at the thames foyer was quite enjoyable. i had to return to london with my family for a few days. the rooms are very nice, but not even as special as the vast majority of five star hotels. they are new, new, new...their best feature. in fact, they fall a little short on the luxury score. i am surprised at some of the things that other guests rave about that you think one would take for granted at these prices. turn down service and nice sewing kits are five star amenities. if you get a butler who knows the ropes, its a nice feature: but they are not all performing equally in terms of service. | i was promised before i even committed to booking rooms that the crowds off the streets would not preclude ""priority"" for seats in the bars and in the thames foyer. i was told that within fifteen or twenty minutes notice, a guest would be shown a table, by virtue of his status as an in house guest. i was concerned about this ahead of my stay and i was promised, without doubt, that even during high-volume periods, guests would not have to queue up. celebrities do not. and why should mortals who are underwriting the prodigous cost of the renovation be treated with less status. ""simply tell the maitre d and shortly there after, the next spot in the bar would be yours."" management promised: they actually made a vow. i am alarmed that the guy who posted just recently, as a hotel guest, was not afforded this courtesy. it really does seem unfair that people wandering in off the street create so much frustration for guests who want to enjoy many of the reasons the savoy is their choice. | i am surprised guests are amazed when they actually experience five star service. the waiters should pay attention and it is normal to have a particular waiter look after you during tea or lunch. | i think the savoy should make a commitment to its guests who are staying at the hotel that they are truly priority number one. the relatively easy check in process should not be marred by an endless wait for luggage. it is my experience in five star hotels that luggage is not piled onto a trolley in a massive group with other guests' luggage and delivered in due time. it should be one bellman delivering your luggage exclusively, simultaneous with your check in. i, for one, do not want my luggage squashed beneath the weight of half a dozen other people checking in. and waiting until the bellman has a full cart before sending up the luggage is just the first hint of slapdash treatment. that is not five star service and is absolutely unacceptable. | the rooms, yes they are nice. but they do not make you feel as f you have checked into one of the finest hotels in the western hemisphere or in london. and the hotel needs to decide if it wants to crowd in a gazilion people in its public spaces while crowding out the guests who are staying in order to enjoy the full savoy treatment and experience. | for some reason i think the hotel is simply overpriced. i have stayed in rooms that cost double (and i am not bragging) and i have felt as if they were bargains. i have stayed in budget motels that feel like i have been cheated for the price. so its not just the price. its getting what you should expect at any price point. at the savoy, onecreally does not get the level of service, or such amazing rooms, that sets it apart from the best hotels in london. especially if you compare prices. yes, the savoy is new and the lobby is stunning....but the rooms are smallish...even the high priced rooms. and service is really inconsistent. and without the riverview, the views can be absolutely dreary. | i think the strand/ theater neighborhood impresses guests who like a super busy, frenetic vibe. | just do not expect a dedicated bellman, which is absolutely unforgivable or the promised priority treatment in the various venues. can the hotel management or gatekeepers at the bar really ferret out the guests? | and slightly off point, and this is not really the savoy's fault, but why does tripadvisor allow so many reviews by people who do not stay at the hotel? reviews for tea, the restaurant and bars have their own tripadvisor review sites. a stroll around the lobby does not quite compare with the experience if staying at the hotel as a guest spending a good deal of money on a room (and not getting a seat in a nice location in the dining room for breakfast, for example). | who wants the constant hassle of ""swimming upstream"" for five star treatment, like getting luggage immediately or having a breakfast experience that does not create a creeping sense of anxiety. | or getting a room made up in a reasonable time frame: you can call housekeeping or your butler at 10:00 am, for instance, and say you will be out for three hours, could you please have the room serviced while your out? and then you come back to a room that had not been serviced. management shrugs its proverbial shoulders and says it will get to the room in good order (even if it is 5:00 in the afternoon!) a five star establishment needs to be prepared to cooperate with the guests. i have never experienced such a thing! it is not club med or a tour bus hotel. i will say this: there is no hotel i have ever stayed in where even the general manager or head of housekeeping does not say ""thanks for letting us know that you will be out of your room, we will send housekeeping up straight away."" it is not acceptable the hear, ""well we cannot clean all the rooms at once and we go in order""...just like luggage delivery and getting a seat at the bar. | not one thing seems tailor made for the guest's specific experience. the random comments from those who have experienced great service versus those who have received short shrift is all over the map here on tripadvisor. | last, did you notice how management has stopped responding to guests comments on tripadvisor completely? that just goes to show how indifferent they are to our experiences.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''the savoy has a strong reputation and a price list to match. however, my recent weekend visit did not leave me thinking it anything particularly special. positives: the decor in the communal areas is lovely, particularly sensitively refurbished recently and looks great. the staff are efficient, welcoming and very professional. negatives: efficiency needs to be stepped up however: we had to phone several times from the room to get refreshments from room service and an ironing board. the room itself was nice but not up to the standards the savoy advertises, with some grime around the taps and shower in the bathroom, a few 'pubes' around the edge of the bath and the bedroom carpet needed a decent vaccuum-cleaning. bed was comfortable and other room amenities were fine. but i did not feel i was in anything better than a good hotel - certainly not one that is supposed to be up there amongst the finest.'''",1

Newham Hotel,"'''stayed on business working at the olympic village. first of all the staff were excellent. very friendly so i cannot fault them at all. the buffet breakfast was good. however the room was not the best i have stayed in. nor anywhere near it. bathroom door hanging off its hinges, bed throw not very clean and a fridge that did not work. also free wifi was available but it rarely worked! i was given an upgrade to a deluxe room. i would not like to see a basic one! convenient location for the olympic village so just be aware if you stay here, do not expect too much.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''this is a lovely old hotel. the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. our room and the corridors were old and tired but nothing that a bit of decorating would not fix. i was shocked at our bill when we checked out. over $4,000 for two nights which was much more than the quoted rate. i was told it was because of the 20% vat tax that was not included in the advertised rate.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''my husband and i stayed at the ridgemount hotel in bloomsbury, london on our recent trip to europe. | as expected it was not flashy nor fancy but served the purpose as a base for london. the location of the hotel is on busy gower street and we were fortunate enough to have a room all the way down stairs in the room most furthest away from the noise of the street. most people would hate it since it was quite dark and hidden away but we did not mind it as it helped us sleep better and get over our jetlag! | transportation to and from the hotel was quite easy with use of the tube stations nearby and aled, the owner, was extremely helpful in his suggestions for activities to do during the day, especially since he knew what the weather was going to be like! | wifi in our room did not work but the common room had a computer which we used often. | the breakfast was the normal english b&amp;b fanfare consisting of eggs, bacon and sausages with tea, coffee or juice. | the rooms themselves were very dated and a bit 'shabby'. we shared a bathroom with the adjoining room next to us and it was not that bad, although we were locked in a few times due to a faulty lock! (we advised aled and he quickly fixed it). | overall, if you are looking for a clean bed in a convenient location and only using the room to sleep while you explore london during the day, then you will not be dissapointed here.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''we stayed at the newham for four nights. it is really very basic and not located so conveniently. as a matter of fact, it is a good 20 minutes walk to the stratford station and at least another half hour drive with the underground. if you decide to take the bus (the stop is a minute walk from the hotel) you can reach stratford in 5 min and the city in app 1 hour. our en-suite room was small but it had all the necessary. the bed was very comfortable and the staff helpful. breakfast was good and the wifi is free. overall, considering that we paid app 50 pounds for a room near london (with breakfast) it was a good choice for a short stay. tip: ask for a room in the main building and located in the back (noise!)'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''our family of 4 stayed at the rhodes hotel in mid-july for 5 nights. i booked a quadruple room online beforehand. while in some hotels in europe this ends up being 2 connecting rooms, at the rhodes we were given a room with a double bed, twin bed, and roll out chair/love sofa. see picture. the bathroom was clean, new, but teeny tiny and barely room to stand in there. the window looked out into a small courtyard with walls of the building on all sides; we had a ladder from our window leading down to the courtyard and then right back into the building (i did not think this was a great fire escape plan). there was a small refrigerator and nice flat screen wall mounted tv in the room. we only slept there as we just got too clausterphobic to spend more time in the room. thank goodness for the air conditioner as the weather was unusually hot during our stay. the front desk staff was very helpful; the breakfast downstairs was just okay. the location was great and the best perk of this hotel, with paddington station nearby, hyde park, and several moderate priced restaurants. if i had to do it again, i would book adjoining rooms simply because most european hotel rooms are too small for 4 people!'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the mandarin oriental hyde park used to be our hotel of choice whenever we were visiting london, and we always took a really good room or suite. we love the mo group with the mandarin oriental bangkok being our favourite hotel in the world (nearly 30 years regularly visiting). among the many vistits to the mo hyde park we spent a two week period there a few summers ago and it was during that time we decided that this mandarin was not what it used to be, there were lots of niggardly things, mostly all to do with service, but also it had lost something of it is class/style for us, and so we switched to the newly opened savoy and were very happy. this latest trip to london was just a single night and so we decided to give the mandarin one more go, but we were very disappointed... | we arrived at the hotel at 15.15h and the room was unavailable, after an upsetting amount of aggravation, because we had a late appointment to attend in london for which we needed to wash and change, we were given a room and an upgrade, which was very nice but... they had already upset us which did not bode well for our meeting, and to top it all they later missed our turn down service. we also had to wait for a considerable amount of time for our cases to be collected when we were leaving, and we rang down with plenty of notice. | also after our dinner that evening we returned to the hotel with our guests for drinks... again we cannot believe what met us, a bar full of noise, shouting, and drunk people. i guess they are aiming for a different age group and market to us; just not what we consider five star, we will definitely not be returning.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''let me start by stating that the mondrian is my favourite hotel in london. the tom dixon styling and nautical themes, combined with the location and attention detail made the mondrian feel contemporary, luxurious while feeling the height of modernity. | since changing from the morgan group to sbe, the offering has been cheapened up a bit for the sake of cutting costs and it makes all the difference. | the shower head was green and crusty for starters which is totally unacceptable. the fabulous malin and gotez bathroom products has been replaced ceil and the are remarkable unremarkable. while you could argue unimportant. little details are what is makes the mondrian special. | the service at breakfast is no where near the quality it was before. the seamless attention to detail has gone and been replaced by staff who do not really know what is going on or handle requests for a glass of apple juice. | while it is still a beautiful hotel the attention to detail that made this truly luxurious has gone. its intangible but makes all he difference.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''firstly i need to say the service in this hotel is excellent, staff can not do enough for their guests. maybe we expected too much at 400 a night compared to other 5 star hotels we have stayed at. on reflection the price was probably justified by the location which was superb.our room was lovely with nice touches including the double basins, drench shower, in bath tv and coffee machine although a few complimentary biscuits to go with our morning tea would have been welcomed.also our huge bed which seemed to be 2 queen sized beds pushed together with no mattress topper meant there was an uncomfortable ridge where the 2 mattresses met breakfast was plentiful with a wide choice to suit all tastes, staff at breakfast were friendly and extremely efficient.on the whole we enjoyed our stay at the corinthia but for us it just lacked that extra little something'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the rhodes hotel has two buildings. when i arrived on the front desk i had to go to the other building which is a 100 yards around the corner. my single room was on the 4th floor, no lift and a very narrow corridor. the cabin size room was clean, the tv remote did not work. the bathroom was modern but certainly built for slim people. | the continental breakfast was included and had a wide variety including fresh fruit. english breakfast extra for 6. (was not quite stated on my booking). | the hotel is a few minutes walking distance from two tube stations, quiet and i slept well. wifi was free and worked well. | one fire door was secured open but otherwise nobody would manage to get through with luggage. the fire escape route was from the 4th floor to the neighbouring building and i am pleased that i did not have to try it out. | ok for a couple of nights stay'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''let us say that hotel location is absolutely strategic, close to the center but not too chaotic that is why my husband and i spent few days there for the second time. room is quite spacious and cozy and especially riverside rooms have an amazing view at night. however, in the bathroom, although there is a large and comfortable shower, it would have been lovely to have a bath tub as well. breakfast is rich and varied, staff is absolutely friendly and efficient. but there is one flaw and i am pretty sure managers should do something in this regard, in the morning you can feel the cooking smell especially in the lift. my point is the smell of freshly baked bread is comforting, homely and i bet that to almost all of us is undeniably delicious, but having the lift plagued by the smell of sausages mixed up with other stuff, sorry to say, but for a 5 star hotel this is not nice at all.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''chose this as a more upmarket hotel for my mothers 75th birthday. not that special though. overall good location, breakfast good and rooms reasonable but the staff are varied; some are really pleasant while others are close to rude and unhelpful at both reception and in breakfast. on arrival one of my rooms was not ready but receptionist was unapologetic in fact it was just a matter of fact for her. i took one room then waited while the cleaners chatted in my adjoining room before i returned to reception after an hour to hasten my room as we were waiting to go out. again the staff were unapologetic when i got the room. just needs that bit of leadership and training it seems.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,'''me and my friend stayed for two nights. the room was small and the toilet as well. but me and my friend were satisfied with room and the service. | the best thing about this hotel is the location. there are many restaurants nearby the hotel. there are two underground stations (paddington &amp; lancaster gate) within few minutes walk from the hotel.''',1
The Savoy,"'''overall enjoyable stay, however did not expect to see dogs permitted in the dining room, not a support or assistance dog, i hasten to add, does let the cleanliness team down as up until then could not fault the domestic standards. | service was hit and miss especially at breakfast time, although any complaints are swiftly dealt with it should not happen in the first place, a training issue i think.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the first room was extremely small with a view of the back of houses. | the second room was fantastic, spacious, with a couch, floor to ceiling windows that open and a view of the v &amp; a. | however, the bed mattress was very uncomfortable. | there were robes in the supply closet, none in the room! | staff was very unfriendly and unaccommodating. only when i said i review on tripadvisor did i get a better room.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''just too noisy. one of the noisiest hotels i have ever stayed at the location is great service was very good. food and wine was outstanding but so much street noise made it an unpleasant stay. my visit was only 2 nights but i would not have been able to stay any longer with the noise.''',1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at the rembrandt between christmas &amp; new year's as part of a british airways package. the location was fantastic but the hotel itself a bit worn around the edges. | save for one charming and helpful desk person, most staff were not particularly welcoming. it might have been the effect of the holidays and associated increased visitor volume. | the hotel is quite adequate but nothing to rave about.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed here 5 months ago, and did not want to return... but this was booked for me so here i am again... | this time i got a room near the back, and i must say no problems with noises from the outside... on the other hand i could hear all doors opening and closing around and above me (and i m hard-hearing... so)... especially in the morning this meant an early rise. | bed comfort was good, bathroom a bit small with shower and bath combined and toilet in the bathroom.the room gives an old / out dated impression... but everything was clean and worked fine. big tv for those who want that. | breakfast, still the same... enough choices but i found the overall quality poor... pastry and bread not ok, still stale croissants also. this should improve. the scrambled egg service us ok though... friendly and taste-full eggs. | wifi is medieval.., extremely slow, not for streaming or downloading... oh yeah you get this nice pop up... inviting you to upgrade your wifi to a paying formula... this was normal business 5 years ago, but these days... not done anymore...especially with the prices they charge, ok this is an expensive part of the town... but fix these things like wifi and breakfast. | overall service is good, i found the staff to be very friendly and helpful... which is always nice. | so this one isn t my first choice... but if no other choice it will do...'''",1
The Savoy,"'''the savoy was a huge treat for us and it was a huge let down. the door staff welcomed us to the hotel and after that, that is where it went wrong. we were looked upon like we were not good enough to be at the hotel. we arrived with just small rucksacks as it was only an overnight stay so perhaps we did not look the ""class act"" that normally stays at the hotel. staff on reception treated us with disdain and furthermore did nothing, absolutely nothing to wow us. not what you expect from a 5*. i am lucky enough to have stayed in luxury hotels across the world and this just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. the room was hot and the a/c hard to adjust to get it cool enough (in the middle of winter!). | my partner and i felt like we were second class citizens and simply just not good enough. what should have been an amazing experience was marred by the service and welcome (or rather un-welcome) we received. i wrote in to express my thoughts and feedback and to date (over a week later) i am still waiting for a reply. simply not good enough.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''luxury courtyard room sounds lovely, however even though we asked for a room with a view, what we got was on the 6th floor was a view of a wall and the courtyard below comprised air conditioning vents. hardly any light entered the room, even though it was sunny outside, my husband had to read his morning paper with the light on. the furnishings were somewhat tired and shabby; there where dirty marks on the overhead valance; the doors were marked and chipped in the bathroom as were the tiles. | spa - the guests were only allowed to use the sauna/jacuzzi/steam room facilities between 7am and 9am unless you wanted to pay an extra 25 or were paying for extra treatments. overall, the spa was okay without being as well-designed as some. | swimming pool advertised in the hotel magazine is not open yet, although the magazine gives the contrary impression. | breakfast one of the attractions for us was that you can sit outside with views of hyde park. we were told on the first morning that it was closed due to the weather (it was slightly overcast though still sunny) and you are not in spain you know dour faced (although the manager later apologised for the remark and explained it was intended as a joke). | we understood breakfast had been included in our booking. at the restaurant, however, we were told it was not included and we would be charged separately for it. we queried this with reception who confirmed that was correct. we therefore had the continental breakfast on the first morning and no breakfast on the second morning. on check out, however, our bill included a charge for 2 days full breakfast (128). we explained what we had been told the previous day but reception initially said we had booked full breakfast for both days, together with a complicated explanation that whilst reception knew breakfast had been pre-booked, the restaurant itself would not have known this. eventually, reception agreed to charge only for one mornings continental breakfast and said they would refund the balance and email us to that effect. at the time of writing, we are still awaiting the refund and email. | heston blumenthal - my husband and i went with our daughter and her partner for a birthday celebration. we had high expectations but over all felt that the meal failed to live up to them. heston blumenthal has a tremendous reputation and his cooking can be very exciting but this did not hit the mark for us. the food was generally nicely presented; of good quality and impeccably cooked but it lacked a 'wow' factor or any element of theatre. it would be hard to say that the meal had any memorable moments or anything you had not seen before. we all had steak for the main course - good but no different to what you would get in any good steakhouse. we have certainly had much more exciting meals in other michelin-starred restaurants for much less. if it had been half the price, you would have said it was a good evening but at nearly 600 for a meal for four, you are entitled to expect more. on the plus side, the host on reception was brilliant, charming and managed to fit us in earlier than we had booked for (as we had made a mistake about the time) despite the restaurant being full. on the minus side, there some elementary things which niggled at the price: the placing of food on dishes had 'slipped' in being carried to the table; the service staff twice mixed up who had ordered what dish; the ice cream trolley which circulates at the end billowing dry ice clouds (and is the only theatrical flourish) looked exciting - but sadly repeatedly circulated past our table without stopping (hopefully other diners enjoyed it though!) whilst the discreet birthday celebration cake we would ordered the night before was forgotten (or was so discreet that we failed to see it). overall, the restaurant's concept (period british food through the ages re-interpreted for the 21st century) is interesting but it needs rather more work before it delivers. we would not choose to eat there again but we have not given up on heston yet.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''my fiance and i had an overnight stay here in apr 2012 and had huge expectations. the grand foyer and beautiful decor are stunning as you enter. our room was a double and on first impressions seemed sumptuous with amazing attention to detail. however, we both had quite a poor and interrupted night's sleep as our room was overlooking the service entrance near the main road. from the wee hours in the morning we were periodically woken up by shouting, doors slamming, loud bangs and the reversing beeps of a lorry directly below our window. | when we mentioned this to the hotel staff on check out the next morning they seemed rather insincere about their apology. we left rather disappointed and disgruntled. this year i think we will stay somewhere else.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''my husband and i stayed here as it was in walking distance of the theatre royal and brumus. we arrived and were whisked straight up to our room with the minimum of fuss. the room was a good size but painted a drab dark beige shade, with heavy old furniture and one window, making the room dull and depressing. nice bathroom, long, light and thin, lots of toiletries which were replenished at turn down. mineral water was available at a price until turn down, when a bottle was placed each side of the bed. very comfortable bed and good quality bed linen. air conditioning only went down to 18.5, which meant the room was stuffy overnight. when we arrived we wanted a cup of tea, not the expensive savoy experience for the tourists. we were sent to the american bar, which was noisy and crowded. i drink earl grey with lemon, hardly unusual. the earl grey was like builders tea, they had used tea bags, not loose tea leaves, and i was give 2 chunks of lemon, not slices. it was horrible. i would expect a 5* hotel to be able to produce a nice cup of tea in a peaceful setting, but it appears not. i had eggs benedict with salmon for breakfast, it was cold with water on the plate, the poached eggs had obviously been partially cooked and then reheated. everything you ordered on the menu cost a fortune. i.e. fruit 12.00, eggs benedict 15.00, toast extra. there are much better hotels in london nowadays and we would certainly not stay here again.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel is well located but showing quite a few signs of being tired and unloved. for example, the room not being cleaned well enough, footprints in the bath not cleaned from the previous user, dust on top of the toilet cistern. the beds are comfortable but our room was a bit tatty in areas. the most annoying think about the hotel were the reception staff. when calling the hotel in advance they never answered the phone, something others complained about as well. we also observed the staff on the front desk ignoring the ringing phone which speaks volumes to me about how important they consider the customer. i do not think i would choose to stay again.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we went for lunch to the river restaurant, to celebrate a birthday. the setting is very pretty and the staff are absolutely charming. we were greeted with a happy birthday at the door and another one by our waiter. | the starters were lovely and came in generous portions. for the main my husband ordered the meat and it turned out a bit chewy (although our neighbours had it and it was fine) when he returned it, they promptly offered an alternative and also took away my dish and got me another one with his so we could eat together. i found it to be very thoughtful, but also right what you would expect at that kind of restaurant. | however after the main they brought a piece of chocolate cake with a candle to celebrate the birthday. the cake was generous enough for both but it was a bit dry and too chocolatey, and they billed us 11 pounds for it. i would certainly have preferred to be given the choice of going for the cake or for another desert and they could have then offered a smaller thing (like many other restaurants) for the birthday without charging us. | all in all it was good except for the cake incident which i found was a bit tactless. had we been there for a regular lunch, we would have probably had a much better experience and i would have rated it as very good, however as it stands i will just go for average.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''family of three with pre-teen boy arrived in london from the us and went straight to the rembrant. it was around 11pm by the time we were in the room and thankfully there was still time to get room service because nearby restaurants were closed.

The Savoy,"'''the savoy is definitely a magnificent property to stay in and the standard of fabric of the building is fantastic....it really is edwardian and 1920's luxury at its finest. | however, the level of service does not match the opulence of the surroundings or the price of a night's stay. whilst there was nothing that spoiled our stay at the savoy there was a lack of attention to detail....and it is the details which make the difference in this price bracket. | the shower was tepid, the room service was late (as well as being cold when it arrived and not removed when asked) and the iron provided took 20 minutes to clean before we could let it near a white shirt. the service in the american bar was glacial and we queued for 20 minutes to check-out. in short, the service was not consistent with the savoy brand. | whilst none of this spoiled our stay, there are better places to stay for the same price (e.g. the ritz).'''",1

"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''after lunching at the berkley and spending some time in london, i decided to visit the bulgari with some friends and my husband on his birthday as he loves a negroni cocktail and they advertise a special negroni cocktail menu on their website. on arrival, we asked for the bar and were directed to the rivea. i asked for the other bar (il bar as advertised on their website - see pics) and 3 members of staff collectively confirmed there is no such bar. i felt really very silly and assumed i would made a mistake in my planning so decided to settle in the rivea anyway rather than inconvenience our friends. when checking their website, it does indeed advertise il bar but i now realise that il bar must be nothing more than the physical bbar sitting in the centre of the rivea which is listed as a separate entity. unfortunately, the staff were equally clueless to this fact and had no knowledge of il anything! we ordered our drinks and our table was then revisited by the waitress who advised that my drink was not available because their blender was broken. really, in knightsbridge and at 17 a pop for a cocktail, they could not source another blender from their own kitchen or a local store? thankfully we would asked for water which kept us going during the fairly long wait for our drinks. despite nobody knowing of il bar, the negroni experience did feature on the rivea menu. the special negroni is listed as ""an immersive experience"". this is creative writing at its best. literally the only choice you get when you ""work with il bar's talented team to tailor the perfect serve"" is whether you want a sweet or spiced vermouth. you get a little chat through the drink which is pretty much what you can read on the website and then watch them make it. no nibbles were provided until we had all finished our drinks and were about to leave. then some olives and very bland crackers appeared with the offer of more drinks. this was supposed to top off a lovely day for a birthday but it really was woeful. given the disappointment we decided to move to another bar so we did not finish on such a low. from the american bar at the savoy to the artesian at the langham and everything in between, we have never had such a shoddy premium bar experience and we are very glad it was only the bar and not the restaurant or a room that we would had the misfortune of experiencing. the bar is of course very classy and undoubtedly a nice environment which appeared to tick all the boxes on arrival but finding the toilets in the very dimly lit maze of doors and corridors downstairs was like a gothic version of alice in wonderland. the treat of the amazing toiletries made it worth the hunt on arrival however. but with plenty of staff and not very many guests to serve there really were not any mitigating circumstances for our succession of poor experiences in what must have been under an hours visit. the bulgari has a lot of catching up to do to be comparable to it is competitors.'''",1

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i was on my first round the world trip in may/june 06 - 6 countries, 10 cities, 9 hotels throughout asia, europe and america. i was not backpacking, but still on a budget. | london was my third stop. | it was my first visit and i absolutely loved it! the fashion, shopping, theatres, history, buildings and everything, so much to see and so little time, it is such a good place to visit. | the ridgemount hotel is located on gower street where there are many other hotels near by. it is about 10 mins walk to tottenham court road station (one of the main stations), 5 mins walk to goodge street station, as well as few bus stops around. it is also easy to walk to the main streets oxford street (shops) &amp; charing cross road. soho, chinatown, leicester square (theatres &amp; cinemas), covent garden and piccadilly circus (the place you can always see in the movies that show those big billboards) are also walking distance. tip: buy travel pass zone 1 2 unlimited usages for buses and trains; it will take you everywhere without worrying too much about excessive transport expenses. | the hotel is managed by a husband/wife. they were very friendly and helpful. you felt like you were well looked after by your relatives. the staff were also nice. you do not really see them around besides at the breakfast table, but they served you well. | the room i got was very small, i am only 51, from the bed to the door took only 2 3 steps, 1 step to the bathroom, i had to put my luggage underneath the table so i would have a room to stand. i do not know how other people coped with this room size, i would not say i liked it very much. despite the size, the room was very clean. with a big window facing the garden, it was quite pleasant to get a nice view and natural sunlight. at night time, it was quiet and you could actually see foxes walking on the fence. | i paid approximately 49 pounds for one night with delicious english breakfast included. the breakfast however, was the same everyday cereal, milk, coffee, tea, juice, fruit, toasts, eggs, bacons, sausages, baked beans, tomatoes and etc. after the 3rd day in london, i found proper meals i actually ate. i found eating was difficult in london, there were not many options available besides fast food or food chain shops. i went to chinatown, paid 5 pounds for a yukkie chinese! if chinese cannot provide nice chinese food, i do not know what else there is. | the weather was horrible in london, it always rained. for example, 2 hours sunshine in the morning followed by pouring rain in the afternoon and then by heavy wind. make sure you always have an umbrella in your bag or wear a water proof jacket. my jeans were always soaking wet and cold, it was not pleasant, nevertheless, experiencing london weather is a must-do, then you will always have something to talk about (lol). | i think in terms of the price, location and the quality of hotel, it was not too bad, i would recommend it if you were on a budget, otherwise, personally i would probably try a different hotel next time especially since there are plenty in london.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''the location is handy for the city, especially if you know all the small alleys to get quickly from one part of the city to another. | the bed was somewhat hard. the room was well laid out with a half wall and sofa and 2 tvs although you could not have the kids watching one tv and you watching the other because the room is too small for that! | bathroom with bath and shower and a good sized basin. lighting good and plenty of space for makeup on a shelf rather than beside the basin. | reasonably quiet but not a quiet as some other hotels i have stayed at in the city.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''my wife and i spent three nights here and we enjoyed our stay. our room was not terribly modern but it was quiet and comfortable. | the room was not as small as i feared. | our room faced the street but the noise was not an issue for us. the owners and staff are very friendly and helpful, the place is clean, the breakfast is ok and the location is great - close to several tube stations and many attractions and pubs. | because there is so much to see and do, we walked to most places. oxford street shopping, the theatre district, piccadilly circus, trafalgar square, british museum and many other places are all within a 30-minute walk. buckingham palace is about a 45-minute walk. | several grocery stores are nearby, too. | in the main-floor lounge, the hotel has a machine that dispenses free coffee/tea and a computer with free internet access. there is a tv in the lounge and there was a small tv in our room. | the hotel is located in a safe neighbourhood filled with university students and tourists. | we would stay here again.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''not bad - service excellent. do not have a car valet - you could do a better job yourself at the local she will garage in less than 5 minutes, and it is 30 cheaper. staff are excellent - attentive, speedy, polite. the biggest let down was the room -nothing wrong with it as such, but there was nothing special about it - distinctly average for a major 5* of this type, and the bathroom was not great - long and thin - bath was tiny. spa facilities are v good - not explained very well.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''there is an abundance of good hotels in london, which makes it difficult for any new entrant. this hotel carries the eclectic and different vibe that we came to expect from morgan hotels. the rooms are roomier and more comfortable than the sister hotel st martins lane. it has slightly more of a business hotel feel than others, probably due to location, but still it is very distinctive. it offers a nice alternative to some city and canary wharf hotels, it is right by blackfriars bridge and southwark tube is 6-7 minutes walk away, although not a particularly scenic walk. overall nothing to complain about and the riverside location is nice.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed on christmas eve as we had to be up very early to collect our daughter from work the following day. undoubtedly the hotel has been fantastically designed but i thought that some areas of service were not to the required standard for a 5* venue. perhaps we were ""unlucky"" given the time of year but my subsequent attempts to discuss these matters with the hotel management by email have been ignored to date which makes me feel that they are not that concerned. | we arrived at 3.30pm by car and pulled up outside with no one to greet us, no concierge and a barely full of christmas cheer receptionist. maybe no one wanted to be working on xmas eve but it was not a great start. the hotel was very quiet and we were checked into the level of room that we had booked which was fine but an missed opportunity to create positive goodwill when an upgrade would have cost nothing. maybe i was supposed to be grateful that we were on the 15th floor? i thought that the room was well laid out, for its size, with several nice design touches although some of the cut glasses were dirty. very surprisingly there was no turn down service whilst we were out when again a small festive message or cocktail mince pie would have been a nice touch. | we had booked a spa treatment but had to ask for robes to be sent up for us . the spa area and staff were great although for some reason we received the wrong treatment to the one i had booked. i mentioned this to the spa receptionist as we left but in any case the treatment we did receive was good and the spa staff excellent. | a quick drink in rummpus meant that we got to see the space which was lovely and i imagine great in the summer but quiet at the time of our visit. | breakfast was a buffet style and ok, not special. personally i prefer teapots and cafetieres to flasks of tea/coffee although i was not sure if this was due to the fact that it was now christmas day. there were probably 4/5 staff including weirdly a man watering the plants at 7.30am, which seemed odd given there had not been anyone to open the front door or turn down the rooms the previous day! the girl that checked us out was great. | all in all i would like to have given this hotel a higher rating as it has so much to offer in terms of location, design and the bar/spa. however other than the spa team there seemed no real desire by the staff that we encountered to interact or enhance or stay and based on this visit it felt that the hotel was lacking a hear or the warmth that we find at some other london hotels..'''",1
The Savoy,"'''our travel agent recommended the savoy hotel over the royal horseguards hotel where we have stayed in the past and loved very much. our expectations were high based on this recommendation and honestly, we were disappointed with our experience by the end of our 5 day visit. | the hotel itself is beautiful, but definitely a bit stiff in terms of comfort within our 2 rooms. one room was in a terrible location facing the back of other buildings and was constantly noisy with the sounds of what seemed to be a communal trash disposal area. every night/wee hours of the morning. we could hear what sounded like glass bottles being dumped in garbage bins. on the first night our air conditioning stopped working and though it was serviced the next day, our room felt stuffy and humid our entire visit despite our repeated concerns. we had a king bed and one extremely uncomfortable side chair. the room felt small and other than that chair and the bed and had no place to sit. | | the other members of our party had a room that was larger and had crisp, cool air circulating the entire time and was very quiet since it faced an office building. much better experience. | our stay included 32 per person per day for breakfast, but even with that the food was pricey and was just average in quality. there are better options elsewhere. | overall, for the price and the 5 star reputation, we really had expected more comfortable accommodations. our experience was average and disappointing. i would not recommend.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we stayed for 4 days at the beginning of june. we had accidentally come in the wrong entrance and within a minute, one of the gentlemen working there had found us, gotten our luggage sorted to be sent up to our room and shown us how to get to where we were supposed to be, which was very much appreciated. our room was nice enough, but not particularly outstanding. the bathroom was the best part of it - roomy standing shower and a lovely deep tub with excellent water pressure and heat. | we had an issue with the bank locking our card due to concern with the unusual charges amassed during travel, but the hotel staff were very understanding as we got it straightened out. unfortunately, they charged us 100 gbs for the phone call to the bank to get it fixed, which seemed a bit much. the cleaning crew could not be trusted to abide by the hanging sign requesting the room not be serviced - whether we put it out or not, they still came in 3 days out of 4. | overall, i do not feel like any aspect of our experience at this hotel equaled the cost charged. next time we are in london, we will definitely stay elsewhere.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''booked into this hotel for 1 night with our 3 teenage daughters. one of my daughters burnt her scalp whilst having a shower as water suddenly became hot and temperature control would not work. luckily the burn was not bad but could have been worse. my husband then used the shower which we have to share with other rooms, and that only gave cold water! | check shower before you use it!!'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''booked this hotel for my son and his girlfriend as a treat for christmas after a hard year. very stylish and excellent service from the staff. only gripe was that they were not allowed in the bar as the age limit was 21 and they were only 19 and 20 years old. shame it was not advertised as i would have picked another hotel for them. they made the most of it though but went out for food and drink instead of spending money on the hotel. room itself was very comfortable but minibar madly overpriced!''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i have stayed at the mondrian a numbero of times as its located very close to my companys london office. overall, i like the hotel, though have some minor complaints. | pros | - great common areas - the restaurants/bars are wonderful. | - nice location. easy to stroll down south bank and find a place for dinner or a drink, or go for a run. | cons | - the rooms are ok, not great. i do not expect big rooms in a city hotel, but i find the mondrian rooms a little on the depressing side - they can be sort of boxy and small. its worth paying-up for a slightly larger room if you plan to stay long. | - the gym is ok, not great. no natural light, kind of cramped. | - service is mixed - in some cases i have found staff to be really helpful and once or twice a bit on the rude side. | anyway, overall its a good hotel, with some minor negatives.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''to celebrate my birthday this year i decided that i would like to have a high tea in london and a high tea in new york. the dorchester was my london choice. the surroundings were sumptuous and elegant and the service faultless. the actual afternoon tea, though, was a tad disappointing. finger sandwiches - fairly ordinary - were the only savrouries, but the scones with jam and cream were delicious. the variety of small cakes and tarts were what disappointed me the most. they were so obviously 'commercial', heavy on chocolate and lacking any real delicacy or skill in preparation. i guess you have to be satisfied with the surroundings ..... the high tea in my home town of melbourne, australia, is much better in terms of quality, and the high tea that was the other half of my birthday celebration - at the plaza in new york - was excellent.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel is located in great area, very near the south kensington tube. unsmiling faces at the front desk (no greeting- i had to awkwardly begin the conversation) was told i needed to wait until 3pm for the room to be ready despite requesting early check-in. this must have been the policy for most of the guests as at 3pm sharp a parade of tourists descended on the two rather dour front desk attendants. | the room itself was fine, nothing special. there was quite a bit of noise from the hallway (which was rather dark)'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''the hotel restaurant, reception and bar area are very well presented. the staff were extremely helpful. we asked for an iron and board which arrived very quickly. the cold buffet breakfast was also very nice indeed. we do appreciate that this is london but 10.00 for a jack daniels and coke and 32.00 for a bottle of cheap prosecco plus 4.40 service charge wow. we had what they call a 'petite' room. now there is tiny and there is tiny. we do not think we have ever had a smaller room. you can use the shower, toilet and sink all at the same time. we could have possibly put up with the size of the room but the aircon did not work well at all. we did report it several times and the reception staff did appreciate our situation but nothing seemed to get done. there is parking nearby but it is in the sainburys carpark and not secure at all. so use it if you are willing to take the risk'''",1
The Savoy,"'''arrange to go here for my birthday lunch managed to get a table on the day never sure if that is a good sign to begin with ..the hotel itself cannot be faulted on elegence but dissapointed to see people wondering around in flowed shorts jeans and flip flops in a 5* hotel?! onto the food we opted for the 3 course lunch menu which is very good value around 30 a head. we waited 30 mins for our starter of soup and salmon no bread offered noticed others were given it the moment they were seated was not impressed , main course was then sent straight after the starter no time to digest ,,, cod was very well cook as was my friends pork no complaints there , dessert was almond sponge which whilst was lovely was served cold and looked pre made ie shop brought! half a bottle of wine cost as much as the meal beware! had coffee in the amercian bar very good again 15 for 2 coffees but i guess you pay for the suroundings, overall good value good food not great service and felt a little cheated!'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the hotel is well located and beautifully decorated. | that is probably about it. | toielt amenities are lacking. | gym is small. | i find most of the staff except the reception unfriendly and inattentive. | trying to be a hipster hotel (?), they have a lot of hipster staff; they are calling the guests by their first name, which is extremely unusual. | bellboys look at you and have no intention to help. | guest services hotline staff have not much patience. | no breakfast canteen for restaurant staff, so they eat at the restaurants and before the guests. | maybe it is festive season that they use a lot of part time staff? | in general, the hotel is poorly managed.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''stayed for 1 night after a concert at queen elizabeth stadium. there were 4 of us (2 couples) so both had double rooms. rooms were very small and basic, as were bathrooms. however for what you pay it is more than suitable. breakfast is included in the price although constantly running out of food, not restocked quick enough, especially if you are in a hurry! buses to stratford run every 4 minutes across the road which is ideal! and if you drive up they have a big car park. in all honesty i would not stay here again, but it suited our needs so all good.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i was unfortunately quite disappointed with my overall stay. having stayed at other hotels of the chain, this one lacked the attention to detail that i expected. while the overall experience was good, the attention to detail was poor. | for example i was very disappointed with the spa&amp;pool facilities. the pool was closed for maintenance. yet i only found out about this after i had checked into the room and discovered a little note on the desk. i really wanted to use the pool and was disappointed that nobody informed me of this beforehand. even worse, when me and my fianc wanted to visit the spa instead, we were told that we cannot enter it together, as it is gender segregated. we were also not told this at the point of checking in and there was no comment on this situation in the spa brochure. we went to the hotel to relax together but in the end we had no way to use either the spa or the pool. | many of the requests i had were not fulfilled at all or in the wrong way (i.e. i received the wrong newspaper). overall it is a nice hotel at a prime location, but considering how much it costs i expect much more. definitely worse than other mandarin oriental hotels i have stayed at in the past.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the location is fantastic - just round the corner from south kensington tube and opposite the entrance to the v&amp;a. stunning. the hotel is ok, but i expect (and frequently get) better at this price for a central london hotel (174/night on this occasion). | i have rated it average because i think on balance this is what it is. | the bar is quite nice, the lobby is nice and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. | the breakfast was ok - nothing special, and the staff at breakfast were really nice, but both the coffee and the tea (pot of tea) were just not nice to drink. | the room we were given was very small for two twin beds (i will try and post photos), with magnolia painted walls, a view of a fire escape, a chair that was so close to the bed it was hard to sit on. the bathroom was equally bleak, no bathrobes, and a bathroom mirror that steamed up and stayed that way so shaving for my other half was tricky. | we asked for a quiet room and used the 'do not disturb' sign in the morning, but the maintenance guy was mending a door/ similar a few doors up so we were disturbed by drilling noise. the aircon is really noisy and the sounds from it vary from helpful dampening of general expected hotel noise, to 'was that heavy machinery nearby'. the housekeepers storeroom must also have been either next to us or very close so we did not get to sleep in. | so in summary, a great location, the staff were very nice, but the hotel overall and the room in particular means that i would call it pretty average.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed at the rembrandt for a week late april/early may with my brother. we shared a twin room. | first: location location location! it was excellent. a few minutes walk to the south kensington tube station and you are on your way! | okay, the rooms.....the room was small, but i figured we would not be spending that much time there so no problem...the a/c did not work for the first few days we were there and even though it was spring, it got hot sleeping. this led us to sleep with the balcony doors open and it was noisy! about half-way through our stay they fixed the air. | the bathroom was very nice...i did not expect a whirlpool tub and was pleasantly surprised! the water pressure in the shower was amazing and we had plenty of hot water! | the down side of the room? no wi-fi in the room. we are from the states and had no cell phone service so we relied on the internet for all communication -- and it was a hassle to go all the way to the lobby everytime we wanted to go online. secondly, there was no clock in the room?!? that is just odd.... | there was almost no storage space for clothes. the wardrobe had plenty of hangers, but the ""dresser"" only had 2 drawers. not nearly enough for two people with a weeks worth of clothes each. | the elevators were very tempermental. mostly they just plain stopped working. the hotel actually had to shut down one of them. thankfully, we were only on the second floor so the stairs were not an issue. i feel bad for older guests that were on the top floors though... | the full english breakfast was superb!!!! the eggs (they had both fried and scrambled) were delicious, and there was a nice assortment of meats, fruits, cheese, juices, potatoes and breads. the nutella was a great addition! | we had a nightcap in the hotel bar every evening and the service was good. we only had one meal there (our first night) and the food was very good as well. | over all, we had a very nice trip and would consider this hotel again in the future!'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed over one sunday eve, check in was supposed to be 3pm, arrived just after 3, and we are still waiting at 4pm, still with no room! had to go back to reception, to enquire what was going on, i then had to wait for 10 minutes while another guest was kicking off after waiting also for an hour! we were then upgraded, which was very welcome! the suite was nice, very clean and well appointed! however the whole hotel had no real pizzazz! everything was there, but no soul! we only paid 150 + vat for a suite inc breakfast ( which was pretty average slap) so can not complain too much. i would stay again, but only if the price is right!'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''my wife and i stayed twice in 2009 (august and then september at the beginning and end of a 7-week vacation). the hotel is convenient, the rooms are quite small but clean, well maintained, and comfortable. the shower is as modern and relaxing as you can ask for. the staff are friendly and helpful. breakfast (which for us sets the tone of the day) is a downside, because the breakfast room is simply too small when the hotel is even close to full. it is hard to move without brushing into someone and staff are constantly apologizing for delay -- not a particularly good start. also, the rooms facing the street are a bit noisy. we cannot complain about this and the rooms are ok if you just recognize that you are going to sleep through the noise of the city. it is london, after all, not a b&amp;b in the alps. | with these minor issues, this is still better than other hotels in the area we have stayed at. the owners are doing the best that can be expected given the limited space and the less-than-perfect layout of the building. and if you are willing to deal with the minor downsides, this is something of a bargain, given the location. from our perspective, we just suggest you consider whether a calm, elegant breakfast and a quiet, elegant room are worth, say, an extra 50-70 pounds a night?'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this is a good value budget hotel in central london. run by a nice welsh couple and very good staff. rooms are basic and spotless clean with decent facilities but can be noisy with traffic at the front of the hotel during rush hour. a hearty breakfast is included and was much enjoyed, as was the good service, the warm welcome and the internet access.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the location is very convenient for shopping and sightseeing. | i took a bed and breakfast option and breakfast was very good. | the reason i had an average experience was down to the leisure facilities. i always filter to a swimming pool or at the very least a gym. this hotel had both but on each occasion i used them, i was charged 7.50. i have never known this before. do not try to swim around 4pm as swimming lessons take over. | nice hotel but a small sting for the extra charging.'''",1
The Dorchester,'''our stay at the dorchester was pleasent but nothing more. our suite was actually 2 rooms put together which felt outdated and very old.. they had 2 bathrooms.....that was a disapointment as well. | found the gym very small and claustrophobic. the breakfast in the gallery was quite pleasent. all in all it was nothing special and i would not return.''',1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the hotel was in a perfect location for us, with in our budget, 110/night. only continental breakfast, which was ok, but not outstanding. there was also a shortage of dining room for the number of guests, and queueing did happen although thankfully not for us. staff (in the main- clicky finger owner at breakfast) were pleasant and helpful. room was basic,just big enough to put a double bed in. shower was hot and running. room had a balcony, which in the spring and summer, must be lovely. squeaky door in corridor, kept waking us. (i must admit to not mentioning it, we kept forgetting)'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the location of the hotel is excellent near hyde park and kensington gardens and close to lancaster gate tube station and paddington station so we could get very easy anywhere in the town and also to windsor and oxford. | the staff is very friendly and helpful. | our room was situated on the 1st floor in a building located 500m away from the main building. it was a small, clean room with no ""view"" (only some roofs and a kitchen window). the bathroom was small too but very clean. towels were changed daily. the bed and the pillows were very comfortable. we had tea making facilities. there was no elevator in the building but we did not need one because as i said we stayed on the 1st floor and the staff helped us with the luggage anyway. the walls are thin so can hear what is going on in other rooms and on the corridor and it was noisy from 7.30 a.m. because of the tourists that were leaving their rooms and because of the workers that were renovating some rooms. but during the night we had a good sleep. | the continental breakfast was poor and it repeated exactly the same things every day . after 8 days it was too much for us. english breakfast was available for extra 3 gbp. the breakfast room is small, so once we had to que to get in, but not happened everyday. | however it was a pleasant stay and i will recommend this hotel to friends'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''the dorchester is definitely one of london famous landmarks where it resides on the famous park lane and having a long reputation for catering towards the rich and famous. the hotel service is no doubt excellent when it comes to the afternoon tea (which requires an early booking, and very good) and their room service. the front desk has a team of eastern european who seem to talk to their guests with slight attitude and in a very computerized manner. the promenade at night turns into a social club where all the rich from the middle east seem to socialize till the early hours of the morning, not mentioned the fleet of one million dollar price tagged cars casually parked outside. | but i have to mention, if you do have the opportunity to stay in this hotel, you have to make sure to fully abuse the concierge as he is one of the best concierges you might ever meet. the word ""no"" or ""sorry"" does not exist in his vocab. | i must say that the rooms are very average and dated. they are done with very vintage british interiors (which i do not mind) and the toilets are fully marbled and well equipped. | to end this, this hotel is used to catering a certain crowd where money is not an issue for them. if you are watching the pennies, then its best to look at other nearby hotels. | overall, good for an experience. but not the best that i have tried.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''it is almost opposite the v&amp;a so wonderful for this, the science museum etc. they upgraded our room (for free), so that was nice. the reason i have rated it average rather than good is threefold: firstly, the breakfast was dull (only floppy pre-sliced bread for toasting), no tablecloths, not enough serving staff etc), secondly, the hotel staff knocked on the door three times (occasions) when we where getting showered and dressed to service the room - then did not service the room when we were out for the rest of the day, thirdly, the bar only had three pretty predictable draught beers, no bar snacks, no people on the plus side, the reception staff were very helpful and professional, it was quiet, and the location was fantastic for the museums. id be happy to pay a discounted rate for this, but full price would have been well over-priced.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the location is excellent which closes to paddington and lancaster gate station. room is quite new and clear but really small. hotel managed us to live in another building without lift, so it is not so convenient to move our luggage to upstairs and also the breakfast is in reception building. overall, it is worth living there for two night in that price in centre london.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''the savoy is a very traditional english hotel with a convenient location near the trafalgar square and the thames. the room was tidy, as the hotel as well, and bathroom spacious. the staff was very attentive. however regarding the price tag per night i do not think at the moment we got value for the money. the breakfast, which you order from the menu, was very expensive the savoy grill as well. we were having dinner there and the bill for three was about 250 pounds (including one beer and one glass of wine), even though the meals were only average. actually i have no idea why i am disappointed with the savoy, the hotel is nice and the total experience was ok.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the hotel itself is very impressive, however the actual rooms are not as special as i was hoping! we did actually ask to move rooms once as the first room we were put in was two single beds pushed together, had a really noisey air conditioning unit and had no bath. the second room was much better although i think the bed was broken and sloped down at the bottom as every morning we woke up half way down the bed! | the rembrandt is full of business types and i found that the atmosphere was quite unfriendly. none of the staff made an effort to get to know us and i did feel a little bit out of place. we were told we would get free access to the fitness suite but when we tried to get in were turned away and left feeling a little embarrassed. | the venue of the hotel is very good right in the centre of knightsbridge in close proximity to a lot of the famous london landmarks and in walking distance to leicester square. | i personally would not go again and did not think that it was worth the high prices.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''hotel well placed for getting about all the museums and good eating places and a short walk to the tube. | rooms- we booked a grand room which was quite spacious but we were disappointed not to have a jacuzzi bath or walk in shower..both advertised a room features. the first night we could not get to sleep as the room was incredibly hot and the air con did not seem to work, there was also a constant rattle from the unit. we reported this to the front desk but on return from a day out nothing had been done so we reported it again. a maintenance guy had a look and said it was the thermostat which was now fixed. however this was not the case, as that night and every other night ear plugs were needed as the constant hum was like a form of torture. | it was nice to have robes, slippers and toiletries but only 2 coffee units for machine was a bit sparse..we asked for some more but none arrived. | breakfast....it was a busy place and as long as you do not mind sitting in rows like having school dinners, then the seating is fine. although the food was ok, there was a very poor selection of bread (only sliced brown), sliced white and baguettes, the cheese was also pre packed lumps. the guys serving were pleasant and worked fast. | the wi-fi was off the whole time we were there which was a nuisance and as mentioned by others some door closers would prevent the constant slamming of doors by all your neighbours. also be aware if you have a connecting room then you can hear all the conversations going on through the door!! | i think the rembrandt has potential to be very good but management need to look back through the reviews and note the same things coming up again and again and actually do something to resolve them. i would go back but i would want to see the room first and test the air con out!!'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''having booked on expedia as a last minute holiday we were really looking forward to staying at this hotel. the decor and the overall ambiance were excellent (thought it did smell of abercrombie and fitch) the staff were a little poor. | the food was excellent though some of the starters were a little odd and should have been a side order and not a starter. | the staff lacked the knowledge and understanding of the hotel and the way in which it is meant to operate. we had a question about the food bill on check out. we were told that the bill could not be separated from the room bill - which is something we have done dozens of times before in various hotels around the world.''',1
The Rembrandt,'''we booked afternoon tea for 4. we were placed (in a virtually empty room) bang next to a staff meeting area. we had a wheelchair user with us so with some fuss moved away from the now screened off area (but the meeting was only inches away). tea was ok. bread for the sandwiches a bit dry and the 2 cakes unremarkable. standard fruit tart and a spicy carrot cake. tea did not arrive until we were 3/4 of the way through the feed. no refill offered - and it was too weak. no staff to call upon most of the time. a dull experience i probably would not repeat when there are so many good places for tea in central london.''',1
The Savoy,"'''we were wanting to stay a couple of nights in london and with a combination of having never stayed at the savoy and a reasonable package being on offer for it seemed to make sense. the package was to include a free dinner and a free upgrade (subject to availability). | the public areas of the hotel are all very impressive in look and the doormen friendly. i was quickly greeted and taken to my room which was a fair maze of steps and lifts to get to it. looking like the grade of room i had booked i asked if no upgrade was possible given their own website was still showing availability. initially they said it was an upgrade, but after checking said it was that there was no availability in higher grades of rooms but when i showed them their own site they said it was because of the date. | a quick call to my booking agent and they said there were no blackout dates and they would speak to the hotel. a few minutes later i was told there had been a ""mistake"" and the upgrade would be applied to a junior suit. reception initially denied they would spoken to my agents but when checking with their manager they agreed they had agreed to upgrade to a junior suite | the room was pleasant enough and an ok size for a junior suite. all the extras in the room were of good quality and in good condition. the bed was very comfortable and well dressed. there were a few minor niggles, using the remote in the bedroom often also effected the one in the lounge which was most annoying when it turned it on but not off, the bathroom door was difficult to close and the second phone in the room was broken. overall the room was ok but lacked any real soul or inspiration. | when trying to contact staff by phone it often a long wait and half the time was cut off in transfer which was irritating. when you do get through to them they are often polite but it is questionable how much effort they put in. i asked the concierge/ butler about a booking at the savoy grill and was told it was fully booked for the day. i called my credit card company straight after and within 2 minutes they had not only secured a booking but also had a number of options of times. | we dined in the riverside restaurant for breakfast both days and dinner once. the breakfast both times was good and i particularly enjoyed the eggs benedict. dinner was not up to the same standard though, the pork chop was slightly dry but exceptionally tough. the standard of service was clearly variable with some being offered stands for handbags but not others, the waitress put the wet tea strainer directly onto the table cloth rather than on a saucer and our wine glasses being left empty for long periods to the extent that there was over a glass left by the end of the meal. | my wife had a visit to the spa, due to the amount of ""groupon customers"" their own staff were all busy however they booked one of their external masseurs was able to come in at short notice but with a 50% loading in the price. the person was very good and very chatty but the spa itself was a little on the dull side. | the two bars were both very pretty and had live music on the three nights we were there. compared to other hotels which the savoy claims are its peers the drinks prices are relatively good. the american bar is the historic one and serves traditional cocktails. the receptionist was very friendly and found a nice table for us. we only had time for one before it closed but my blood and sand was very well made. | the first time we went to the second more modern bar the same receptionist happened to be in the vicinity and again found us seats despite how busy it was but we decided to sit at the bar and had a great conversation with the two bar tenders who both are a real credit to the organisation and it is a pity that both are leaving the company. | the second time we were just going to pop in for one last drink before going. the receptionist this time said that they were too busy and it was a 20 minute wait for a table. as the same bar person was on as the night before my wife said that she would just go in to say hi and then we would leave instead. there was some debate about ""standing at the bar"" and finally was allowed in just to say hi. once actually getting in it turned out there was more than one table still free and one of the barmen seated us. | overall the stay was reasonable. the service was very variable, a few very good members of staff but the majority would be better placed in a much lower establishment. if it did not have the name/ history then i suspect it would be an unknown place. i would more likely suggest that you stay elsewhere and just use the bars and by the number of people paying by cards/ cash it appears i am not the only one thinking this. | there are many great hotels in london and the savoy is not one of them.'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''everything about the hotel was fine on our short visit except we chose this hotel because it had a swimming pool. it is an extra 7.50 per swim. we only wanted a quick 10 minute swim early morning and late afternoon. this would have been 30 for 2 of us. also there was quite a lot of road noise compared with other hotels i have stayed at in central london.''',1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''stayed here last week for 2 nights on the autumn retreat deal which included english breakfast and dinner in the northall restaurant. | we picked the hotel because of location and the improving tripadvisor ratings. it is clear that the hotel follows all its feedback and acts on it. i have already given my feedback to the hotel via the after visit e-mail survey. | i had booked the hotel using their own website and at the time of booking i chose a non courtyard deluxe king but my print out only said deluxe king. i thought that it might be difficult to guarantee where the room would be as the hotel allows 24 hour check in. as it turned out the room was a courtyard view. | the room was large, clean, with a small wardrobe/dressing area. there was a small balcony area opening into the courtyard but there is a sign on the window advising that you may be locked out of your room as the door does not open from the outside. probably good for security but i felt you could easily miss the sign or not understand it if english is not known. the internal doors in the room did not shut properly.. building snags that should be sorted by now. | went to dinner in the northall, meal and service were very good, although menu restricted to 1 of 3 for each course. | visited the cocktail bar, and again all fine there. | next morning went for breakfast. taken to a table, given menu, and coffee was brought. however no-one came to take our order, even though it was very well staffed. my husband told one of the managers that our order had not been taken. still no-one came. we just helped ourselves to the buffet instead. we thought this was quite rude and the service was not up to the standard you would expect. it really did affect what i thought of the hotel. i wrote a letter to say what had happened and handed it to reception. | we went out for a full day and returned at 7pm and went to reception to book a time for dinner. no response to letter. went to the room. it was being turned down for the evening! by the way did not get chocolates as others have written... it was boiled sweets. | dinner fine. | opened the curtains in the morning to see fag ends lying over the balcony and courtyard area. | went to breakfast , and we were given an apology for what happened previously. we were offered dinner in massimo as recompense but that was changed to lunch when we said we were leaving that day. | at check out, i was to be charged for dinner in the northall for one night. the receptionist went to query this and came back and said that it was indeed included in the room rate. i told her that i probably would not book a ""deal"" again as i did not rate the breakfast.(poached egg tasteless and overcooked). | massimo lunch and service excellent. | overall the hotel is fabulous in all the public areas.it seems to be the hotel to be seen at and seems really ""bling"". there seems to be a lot of business and media people. i did see the rent a mob and photographers but none of the drama reported in the press. i think we were expecting too much.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we were dissapointed by the spa - only steam bath and no sauna at all. it was also separated between men and women, so not very good experience if you are in couple. my main dissatisfaction concerns the front desk - i forgot my credit card and even if the room was payed in advance they refused to accept us in the room if we do not leave 100 per night as deposit! i know by heart the number of my credit card, the security code and had my phone for the 3d security connection, the room was payed with the same card, on my name and i had id with me, but they insisted that i should show the plastic... finally, i was accepted with ""only"" 100 deposit, but if i did not have friends in london to borrow some money it could be a very poor weekend. of course, it was my fault to forget my card, but if i know everything by heart, it could be treated as an internet purchase and anyway treated in more friendly way...otherwise, great situation, very pleasant overall design and very comfortable bed.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''hotel location is v good, near paddington station and hyde park. hotel is clean and staff are by friendly and helpful. the rooms however are super small and very difficult to manage your luggage especially if you go shopping. stairs are also super tiny and with no elevators it is very difficult to carry your luggage at high floors. | i recommend it only for short visits.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed in two connecting twins rooms with my mother, my daughter and her little friend for one night. i have stayed at savoy and ritz recently so was interested to see how it compared. well, it did not. i asked twice when booking for twins not king, and reminded both housekeeping and check in to make up beds at turndown as twins. got back from theatre at 1030 very tired, guess what? not done. we had to wait a further 30 mins then to go to bed for them to change it. | i also asked on booking for sone amenities for the girls to be in rooms, cookies etc, nothing was there. i had to remind them, and they did one up with a teddy and a disposable camera hours later. but for these kinds of costs, it should have been there waiting on beds as a surprise. | my daughters friend also had her mobile and purse ""lost"" and she was very distressed about this. it had been gathered up in the bedding and shoved in the wardrobe by housekeeping. it was a bright fuschia pink plastic purse, a bit careless really. | we checked in at 1015am. room still not ready at 3pm. | i would not pay 500 a night to stay again; i would go to the ritz or savoy.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''mandarin oriental hotel is a 5-star hotel. its service is impeccable. however, it is now under renovation, so there is not much choice of dining restaurants in the hotel. the hotel reception is kept in the lower basement. | the room is big, yet the decor is really old. i do understand why it needs to refurbish. one can hear the creepy sound when you open the door of the closet. | room service is wonderful if it is raining so hard and you are too tired to go out. | the view from the restaurant overlooks hyde park. | i was lucky enough to see the queen's guard marching back from the palace while they passed by the restaurant. | the food and service are excellent! superb! especially the french toast abc pancakes for breakfast. | one word or advice, wait till 2018 after they have fully renovated before you go. | of course the price would go up.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''used this hotel for the night of august 31; quick check-in at 6pm, nice bar and restaurant downstairs, service in the bar was okay but not excellent (it was not busy). room was very clean, modern furnishings, well appointed, free wifi etc. i was in a disabled room, although i am not disabled - this was room 326. this has a large wetroom for the toilet/basin/shower area, although i do not know if this is the norm for the hotel. basically it was all good. until i got into bed, that is. | i have stayed in a lot of hotels and i can honestly say this was the most uncomfortable night's sleep i have ever had. the 'king' bed was two mattresses zipped together - which is not uncommon - but what is uncommon is that a) there was no topper on the mattress, so the bloomin' great zipper was rather uncomfortable through the sheets and b) the mattress has darn great dips and bumps in it, and could do with replacing. i tried sleeping on both sides of the zipper to no avail; not nice. | on checkout the receptionist asked if i had enjoyed my stay and i answered that i had had better night's sleep, because i found the bed uncomfortable. her suggestion was that i fill out a comment card. thanks, but no thanks. a reduction in my room rate would have been preferred or even the opportunity to discuss it with management, but this was not forthcoming. still, she ""hoped they would see me again soon"". yeah - i will take a rain check on that one babe :)'''",1
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''we spent four nights in november at bulgari after amex recommended us this new london spot. | the location is nice if you want to shop or to walk in hyde park, down the hotel you will find everything. | rooms are modern and nice even if black and white bathroom design is not original. | room equipment average, no boose or similar to plug your smart phone, a large selection of channel on tv for uk, middle east, but we were not able to find a national french channel we were looking for. no view on hyde park. | breakfast average, we did not have lunch or dinner. | people are taking care of you but the team is very young with a lack of experience. the concierge recommended us a restaurant far from our expectation even if well known as a trendy place. | we asked laundry to clean and sew clothes, they cleaned but did not sew... | ambiance in lobby and bar is a little bit cold, very nice swimming pool and fitness room. | basically it is a good hotel but without charm like at connaught hotel. | still a lot to do with staff training but let us believe things will move in accordance with luxury hotel customers expectations.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''the hotel is at walking distance from the harrod's and many major museums like natural history, sciences, victoria and albert etc. also, the south kensington square nearby offers great variety of places to have a meal or snack. | the hotel breakfast is very well supplied too, nothing to add! | the hotel staff is unfriendly and bored, the concierge would not bother to give any advice whatsoever about restaurants in the neighborhood or other attractions. | also disappointed by the non-refurbished rooms, pricy and tasteless. access to the swimming pool,is not for free which is totally unusual and unacceptable for a 4 ***** hotel.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed here with my husband and another couple while on a weekend trip to london. the room was very nice with lovely decor, it seems like it may have just been modernized. the spa bath was a very welcome bonus after a long day of pounding the streets, however the 'self cleaning' facility on this was to say the least very annoying! basically the bath/spa - sometime after use blows all the excess water out of the system, which in itself is a brilliant idea; but not 40 minutes afterwards just as you are nodding off!!! i jumped out of my skin - good job i do not have a weak heart! this would be brilliant if it happened about ten minutes after use. | also the room itself had air conditioning (why? we are in england not the sahara desert!) and this had to be put on quite a high setting (very noisy) to make the room even comfortable. the room was so hot that you had to have the air conditioning on and the weather that weekend was not hot but pouring down, so quite cool outside. why do hotels insist on having the heating on full blast, it really spoilt my stay. | breakfast was good with a lot of choice. we did however, have afternoon tea on our second day and i would say 'do not bother,' what a rip off. it was almost non existent, of i can safely say that it is the least value for money, afternoon tea i have every had! | overall an average stay in a hotel that promised a lot more.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''hotel just ok with good location; minimal headroom on the floors and corridors, can do more with space seems too compact for the price. | a bit pricey for the amenities provided. | front desk personnel would not necessarily assist with luggage except when asked (both at check in and check out)'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''though not staying at the hotel, i was recently taken to dinner as a guest, we were a group of five. the food was certainly of a high standard, but the evening was utterly spoiled by the terrible service. after mineral water was served there was an interminable wait for the wine list and a further long delay before the wine arrived. no menus appeared and when one of our party got up from the table to ask someone if we could have some menus, she was peremptorily told "" i am rather busy at the moment madam, i will get someone to bring them over"" - extraordinary! | when we eventually gave our orders and were served the wine, on both occasions, the member of staff did not think to deal with the two ladies first, we very tactfully had to point this out. | two of us had desserts; big mistake, another lengthy delay. perhaps we were just unlucky, but at an establishment at this level with prices to match,that should never happen.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here for a couple of nights between stops in edinburgh and paris. i booked it because of the star rating and generally favorable reviews, but found it rather unimpressive overall. my room was reasonably quiet and well-maintained, but very dated (perhaps i had one of the non-renovated ones) and was easily the smallest hotel room i have ever tried to cram myself into. hallways, while clean enough, looked more suited to an economy motel than upscale lodging. location is reasonably good harrods is a 10 minute walk down the road, history museum is across the street, etc. but it all felt somewhat charmless. staff was pleasant but seemed a bit flustered and curiously uninformed). pretty good free breakfast in the crowded dining room (though they did appear to keep running short on things). overall, you could do much worse but if you are like me and really do not get to london as often as you would like, id still recommend splurging on someplace with a bit more panache.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''location is very good. walking distance from british museum, covent garden and soho. also convenient for shopping, as oxford street is just few blocks away. rooms are small (what can you expect for this price in the centre of lonfon), tv, hairdryer. no free shampoo, so take your own. | disadvantages: really thin walls and floor/ceiling. you can hear someone heavily snoring in the next room or watching tv above you. if not that - i would have rated this hotel above average. | important note - they have pickup/transfer service from airports at bargain price - go for it. | will i stay there again? i am not sure.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the staff have boundless energy - they are all very very young, and it is all very funky, but i had difficulty in distinguishing staff from customers... | regardless, the service was impeccable if a little over enthusiastic in wanting to clear our lunch plates every ten minutes before we had finished. | views are limited, given that the restaurant is on the ground floor (why i wonder?), and they have had a good stab at refurbishing the sea containers building into a hotel. | however, it felt a little bit 'form over function' for me and i did not feel as comfortable as the staff appeared to be. | would i stay here? i doubt it. there is currently a huge building site opposite and it all feels a bit 'work in progress'.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''great location, a plenty of buses on the street. 10 min on a bus and you are at trafalgar square. breakfast is good and tasty, everyone is extremely helpful. my advise - do not book a single room. it is so tiny, i 've never seen anything that small. i could barely fit into a shower and could not move around. plumbing in the bathroom is in a bad shape. i did not see double rooms so cannot comment. again, my mistake was to book a single room, could not fit into such a small space, therefore 3 stars.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''overall we felt this stay was overpriced for a very average stay, the room was clean, however, for the ladies there was no power point close to a mirror to do hair and makeup and when staying at the savoy one does not expect to have tea slopped in ones saucer nor champagne spilt in the afternoon tea butter dish, for a birthday treat not memorable for the right reasons.'''",1

Rhodes Hotel,"'''i booked a room at rhodes hotel based on the positive reviews here on tripadvisor. | first the pros: | * location was great. a few minutes from lancaster gate tube station. | * the price was also very reasonable, 90 pr night which includes continental breakfast (coffee/tea, juice, milk, cereals, croissants, fresh fruit, ham, jam, cheese). for 3 pounds extra you get an english breakfast. | * the room was refurbished with new beds and and a 32"" lcd tv which is very rare in 2-stars hotels in london. the room also had a little fridge to keep soft drinks and beers cold and that was very nice since it was very hot the days we were there. | * hardly any street noice. | * very clean room and towels were changed on a daily basis. | cons: | * the room we stayed in was situated on the 3rd floor in the annex further around the corner and the breakfast was served in the main buliding which we were not informed about when making the reservation at booking.com. it was first when i e-mailed maria i was told that the room was in the annex on the 3rd floor. however, she told us that we were free to cancel the booking if the location of the room was inconvenient for us. | * the room was very hot which really lowered our sleep quality. there was a fan placed in the room which was turned on all the time we were there but it was by far inadequate. the windows were not able to open up more than a few inches so that was not really an option. it is only the rooms in the main building that have ac. | * my boyfriend did not sleep comfortably because the beds were not long enough. he is 6'3 feet. due to his height he stroke his head on the bathroom door frame several times. | maria greeted us upon our arrival and drew a map to show us where the major attractions were which was really nice and helpful of her. furthermore, a young guy took our luggage to the room (and we forgot to tip him - sorry!) so the service was very good. | all in all it was a good experience but make sure that you book one of their superior rooms in the mainbuilding with ac and a little terrace as it only costs 20 extra each night but well worth the money.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''arrived quite late so were given probaby one of the tiniest room in the hotel even we stayed for 3 nights. there was max 0,5m space around the bed and about a meter to the door. the bathroom was of a decent size and well equipped. | the window was facing sainsbury's and the very busy main road. noise from outside is bad 24/7, earplugs do not help. also the lack of a minibar was compensated by the cold breeze coming from this very same window. so drink remained chilled by the window - and also the person trying to sleep by it. | otherwise the hotel is nicely decorated, housekeeping great, beds excellent and wifi fast. but due to aforementioned issues with the room size and noise maybe will look elsewhere the next time.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we checked into the savoy on thursday, march 28. we flew in from the barcelona leg of our trip and we received the savoy suite experience pickup at heathrow. the gentleman that picked us up was on time, but very quiet. the ride from heathrow to the savoy took well over an hour (lots of side streets, taking a very long way around). having been to london several times before, we knew this was not typical. he was on the phone several times, so we surmised that he was stalling as our room was not ready. we booked through american express fine hotels and resorts, and had requested an early check in, so we were not surprised. | we arrived at the hotel around 1:30. we were greeted by several very kind gentlemen at the front door (certainly some the nicest encounters of our stay) and were whisked up to our room. we booked a ""classic suite,"" which is a one bedroom suite. when we arrived at room 864, we were greeted by our butler and given the general information needed. our first impressions of the room were disappointing. we had an edwardian style room that was certainly the smallest of their suites and the bathroom was shocking for what we typically experience in a suite and from what we expected from the website. the king bed took up 80% of the bedroom, making it very difficult to walk around and the huge wardrobe was difficult to get to if someone was trying to get to the bed. the sitting area was larger, nice for our son's rollaway bed, but sparse. we had a ""courtyard"" view, which effectively overlooked a very small slice of the thames in one room and the walls of the building everywhere else. the bathroom was hugely disappointing. the size of the half baths in the two hotels we had just checked out of, villa kennedy in frankfurt and hotel arts in barcelona. the bathroom had a single sink, toilet and a bathtub/shower combination with a half glass swinging door. the tub was very tall and difficult to get in and out of, water sprayed everywhere and was too short so my 6 foot husband had to bend over to wash his hair just to get under the shower head. | we just figured this is how it is, they probably did not have the requested upgrade that is requested when booking through american express fhr and this was a typical classic suite. butler service was fine, if i called, they brought tea, etc. , but nothing out of the ordinary. | the second day, we went shopping for the day and after we arrived back we noticed a very strong odor in the room immediately upon walking in. i called the butler, who sent housekeeping and he suggested that maybe there was something wrong with the air conditioning and brought in a air cleaner to help with the smell. he said he could barely smell and and thought it might be something electrical. i felt like i was going crazy, as this was a very obvious burning chemical small. all of us noticed it, but no one was acknowledging it. engineering came in and checked and said everything was fine electrically and that he smoked, so he did not have a good nose to smell anything. after about 45 minutes, the smell was not going away, so we called our butler again. we felt silly as we rarely complain about anything, but the butler and the head of housekeeping stopped by. she said right away that ""she knew what that smell was and that they had cleaned the carpets while you were out today."" she suggested that while we were out for dinner we leave the air cleaner on in the main living area and leave the windows open to air out the room (mind you it is 35f degrees in london that night) . we agreed and left for about 5 hours. upon returning (around 10:30pm), turndown service had stopped by taken the extra pillows we would requested the night before out of our room, closed all of the windows and had taken the air cleaner away. the smell, while slightly less was still there. my husband had a headache from being in the room earlier and we decided to let the butler know when re-requesting pillows that we would like to speak to the general manager in the morning. why would they have carpets cleaned mid stay? we immediately received a call from the night manager and they wanted to know what we would like to do about the situation. it was late, we were tired and very tired of dealing with the situation. we just wanted to get the issue over with and not have it ruin any more of our day, so we agreed to switch rooms. the night manager and our butler showed up soon thereafter and we moved a few things from the current room to what he said was a room with a better layout, 562. when we walked in, the room was beautiful and larger than our previous room. the bathroom was somewhat larger, but with a separate tub shower and double sinks (a much preferred combination for a suite) and was noticeably larger than our previous room. the room was edwardian style with pretty chandeliers. we walked in the bedroom and noticed the queen bed. a non starter for me, as my husband snores and needs the space of a king. the manager calls down and asks for another room and we are moved one more room next door to 560. immediately upon walking in, we are shocked. not only is the room quite larger, it has a huge bathroom with double sinks, a claw foot tub, separate shower, and wc. there is also a half bath in the same location as our previous whole bathroom. the room is art deco style, so some might consider it slightly less charming, but we really loved it. there were small slices of the thames from each window. it ended up being a very comfortable room for the three of us. we were happily ensconced and moved the rest of our things in the morning. | the next two mornings we would requested tea with our wake up call. both mornings they confirmed the tea upon calling, but the tea never showed up. very small minor inconvenience, nothing to scream about, but noted on the list of blunders we would had already. we requested a few things from the butler: to see if the concierge could book dinner for us at the savoy grill that night, confirm our reservation at rules for easter and book fast track tickets for us at the london eye and the corresponding river cruise. when we arrived back, there was an envelope with the receipt for our eye tickets, but that was it. unable to get into the savoy grill until 10:45pm, we decided to just have dinner away from the hotel. on the day of our eye tickets, my husband went downstairs and asked the concierge about the river cruise tickets and where we needed to check in. they told us just to go into the fast track area and that you could pay for the river cruise when you get on it. we get over to the eye and there is no guidance where to go. my husband walks into the ticket area (having been there before, he knew to do this) and while standing in line for 15 minutes someone tells him he is in the wrong line and needs this pass and hands him a timed fast track ticket for two hours before. thankfully that seemed to work and they let us on the eye with no issues. we went to check out the river cruise and discovered that they leave on a schedule and you have to buy the tickets before you get on the boat. luckily, their schedule and out schedule worked out. i am surprised the concierge of a major hotel does not know the ins and outs of the eye. i cannot imagine we are the first guests to take a trip the eye or on the river cruise. | there was a lovely children's egg hunt on easter and my son had a ball. the staff was lovely and really made it fun for the kids. breakfast in the thames foyer was great everyday. we ended up having afternoon tea in our room because there was no availability on easter for afternoon tea, but we really enjoyed it in our room, so it did not bother us at all. | all in all we would stay at the savoy again, and upon checkout my husband confirmed that the rooms we stayed in were all comparable classic suites, there was never an upgrade. he let the manager know upon checkout that we would have not stayed again based on our first, very small, disappointing room, but that we would based upon the last room we had. she noted it in our file, but said they could not guarantee it. for the life of me, i cannot understand how those three rooms are in the same suite category. to go from about 550 sq ft total and one bath with a single sink and tub shower combo, to an 850 plus sq ft room with a huge bathroom and half bath, makes zero sense. i would be disappointed if upon returning we had the first room after having been in the other rooms we saw and ultimately stayed in. | all in all, we felt like we were just guests in a very large hotel. we did not see our butlers often, and no one greeted us by name. those are very small details, but in most of the five star hotels we stay in, large or small, those little details go a long way. the jury is out on whether we will return to the savoy next summer or try something new.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the hotel's location is awesome - right next to the tube entrance, just across hyde park and one side, and on the other you have access to knightsbridge for all the shopping you can ever ask for. it is also a nice walk away to the museums and other attractions. | interior wise - the hotel has an old charm to it, staff offered excellent and personable services, we were showed to the room, and asked to spend some time to explore the room to make sure we were comfortable and happy with it. while i am not massively huge in physique, i do like being pampered in oversized beds (i.e. king sized) - it is an indulgent i hate not to have in a luxe hotel. and unfortunately in this room, they only offer a queen-sized bed. but i did not make a fuss of it, thinking i will be fine, and i did not want to pay more just for a bigger bed - but ended up getting bad sleep. | the hotel has a beautiful gym and indoor pool, the afternoon tea in the lounge was pricey but lovely. the fact that diner by heston is in the hotel, also meant i could be all dressed up and walk straight into the restaurant, drink all i want, be drunk and back to bed immediately :)'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''trying very hard to be cool and failing miserably. a combination of shoddy service - both bars are a disaster to be avoided - and contrived interiors make the whole place feel very unwelcoming. the person on reception was pleasant enough and the room was nice with a river view although we had to pay extra for that. | the bathroom had some very weird lighting which was either blinding or so dim you were stumbling about in the dark. the shower door did not close properly. the bed was comfortable enough. | the rumpus room was one of the most pretentious 'spaces' i have ever been in. we were ignored by staff and when we finally got some attention we were shown to a table with strict instructions to vacate in one hour. fair enough but the place was mostly empty at 4pm, probably due to the intrusive rap music, security guards wandering around and the awful, over priced drinks. the 'woodland pine martini' tasted like pine toilet cleaner smells. we did not linger. | breakfast was ok, usual buffet stuff, nothing special. i asked for tea which was poured directly from a giant pot by the server, no option to brew your own so tough if you do not like strong tea. | luckily we got a reasonably good deal on the room rate, but we will not be back'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed in september 2017 for 1 night for business. i was pretty disappointed with the hotel. it is in a great location so it is a shame the details you might expect in such a prime spot are not there. the check-in was really slowly - loads of concierge staff standing around chatting but just one check in person who seemed intent on dragging out the time taken to check in the previous guest. would have been nice for someone else to have been called or to have been acknowledged, particularly in such a big hotel. there are elements of the hotel that are a bit shabby, and others that are quite decent. i booked an executive room thinking it would be a treat, but it was tiny and the only apparent difference i can see from the website is that you get a dressing gown! there was a really musty damp smell in the room, but fortunately the windows opened - pretty unpleasant welcome. rubbish mattress and a really squeaky bed topped off a very non 4 star experience. i decided to have breakfast in my room - good range of options and i am sure it would have been a great breakfast - except that it never arrived! the check out was equally frustrating and slow unfortunately - i gave up checking out the first time and then came back and had to wait ages. | the conference facilities are pretty good, restaurant coped well with a large group - though there were quite a few technical issues with microphones etc. | all in all i would not really recommend this place - odd smells, missed breakfasts and poor service sum it up.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''ok, the location is great, and the lobby is filled with flowers. dinner at the grill was very good. | but the room was a disappointment. the first room was filled with an overwhelming smell of perfume, and i got a headache instantly. called the front desk, and was escorted to a second room. the front desk attendant agreed that the first - and second room smelled strongly of perfume. she explained that some of their guests use a significant amount of perfume, and rooms are left with an odor that is difficult to clear. i was brought to a third room that smelled neutral. | after dinner in the grill i went straight to bed. the room was across the hall from a service door. i am not a light sleeper, but the traffic in the hall (room service?) was loud and disturbing until about 3am. i did not call the front desk, as i would already moved twice and it was after midnight. | left promptly at 8 the following morning (after a lovely room service breakfast). | i love some of the other dorchester collection hotels, particularly the hotel bel-air. but i would hesitate to stay at the flagship on next trip to london after this experience.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''mostly excellent - but let down by the non-kid-friendly afternoon bar (no 11 yr olds?) and though most staff were impeccable, a couple were unfriendly to my 11 yr old niece and 70 yr old mother (who asked if she could post a letter and rather than being directed to thew concierge was just was told no).'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i find it very hard to critique this hotel because there was not a lot that was offensive and nothing went wrong. | we were welcomed by a lot of people as we walked through to reception, and staff were attentive enough to take our bags for us. the reception, bar and lobby are very luxuriously decorated. | however the room (a petit double) was very small (as we had read on tripadvisor a few days before) - so even though the size was expected, i was left slightly underwhelmed by the room itself - it was very standard looking, and not worth the price we paid. not offensive - but not something i would rave about either. | conveniently located between earls court and gloucester road tubes, we were able to get to any central location quickly. great neighbourhood. we did not eat in the area but plenty of choice. | note that the hotel does not have a car park but have a deal with the neighbouring sainsburys - you need to go into the hotel first to tell them you want to park there and then they sort it out. we however lucked out with a neighbouring residential road where parking after 13:30 on a saturday is free until monday morning. | personally. i would not book in this hotel again unless i got a great price.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,'''the best thing about this place is the location. very close to three train stations and the buses are outside your door. the staff are lovely and very helpful. the hotel rooms are incredibly clean but old and a bit tired. there are no coffee and tea making facilities in the room and only one power point and no fridge.''',1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the hotel is just about ok, has all the basics, is clean, has nice reception staff, but: | - paper-thin walls so you hear your neighbours | - street noise is unbearable with traffic day and night | - location is quite far from central london | - no lift and steep stairs - you need to be an athlete to get to the upper floors | - tiny room | - no proper cooked breakfast | i would not stay there again'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the tone of our visit was set when it took 15 minutes to check in. despite not arriving until 4pm, reception could not confirm that the room was ready. we paid over 400 for a room without a bath, and with a grey concrete patio overlooked by many grim offices in a downtown part of london. more fool us!'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''stayed in a single room with ensuite at the rhodes hotel for 2 nights in august 2017. my main reason for choosing this was really it is location and price - and the fact that it had airconditioning. it is very affordable for the location. however, be prepared for a tiny room. i had a 5th floor walk-up and they very kindly brought my suitcase up for me (i do not think i could have done it by myself along the narrow staircase). there was some work being done on all the other rooms in the same floor so there were workmen and dust all over the place. i did not feel all that secure being a solo traveler. the room was clean and the bathroom was modern but i would not have stayed there for more than 2 nights. my friends had a double bedroom in the basement of their annex and again, it was tiny. breakfast was...okay, a very basic continental breakfast. i would not describe it as a boutique hotel but more of a budget hotel. it served it is purpose but i would not stay here again.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''stayed at the dorchester for a romantic getaway last year. i had booked champagne and flowers in advance but unfortunately it took 3 phone calls to reception to get this organised which took the surprise element away and left a bad impression. initially our room overlooked an air conditioning unit which was disappointing for the money we paid, the staff did however move us to a better room on request. | breakfast was lovely, very luxurious, impeccable service. overall, a luxurious hotel, great location but not really worth the money or hype.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''nice ambience, dcor, setting, super seeing exotic cars in lot outside lobby | great bar service. | but slow food service for dinner. | &amp; yet hotel is booked solid but lack food service wait staff, does not add up. | great for meet others in lobby &amp; head out to see city etc. | food service was for pm dinner.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we spent the month of september in the rembrandt. the hotel is clean, the staff was friendly, the breakfast was good and the location is excellent. it is across the street from the v &amp; a, near the natural history museum, short walk to the underground and several good restaurants. neil cowan, the concierge, was fun and interesting. he and his staff were a great help getting tickets and recommending places of interest, restaurants, etc. all good, right? we had 2 problems. the air conditioning in our room made a very strange noise. so bad, i had to use earplugs when sleeping. it took over a week for the problem to be corrected. this after many complaints. be prepared if you book this hotel. they want full payment up front. we have never stayed anywhere that had a policy like that. then, we asked to be billed in british pounds, not us dollars. we knew we would get a better exchange rate from our cc. when we got our cc bill, they had billed us in us dollars. cannot think of an excuse for that! | over all it is a nice place to stay but we will look elsewhere if we go to london again. just an aside.....london is a very clean city! amazingly so. having been to paris and rome in the last 2 years, we were happy to see the streets, trains and train stations so clean and well cared for. congratulations to the city. we loved every minute we were there.'''",1
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''my parents and i stayed 3 nights in bulgari when they visited london in december 2013. the stay was good, and i would highly recommend this hotel if not for some staff members. they counted the cash payment when we were checking out in a separate room behind the reception desk, and claimed that there was a shortfall of 200 pounds, which was reduced (surprisingly) to 150 pounds when my parents insisted on a recount. the recount was done by an assistant manager, but she identified herself as a manager to my parents despite her name card saying otherwise. | travellers beware!!!'''",1

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''my fiance (over from new york) and i stayed here recently. i lived in london previously for 25 years so i knew the hotel when it used to be hyde park hotel (1992). it seemed that time stood still. much of the decor has not changed inside the rooms. the first room was such a disappointment. it had the feel of a shabby laura ashley decorated interior. in 1995 it would have been lovely. even if furnishings were traditional it should not feel grotty/old/past its time; it should feel clean and fresh, not musty. the bathroom had green toilet fluid on the seat. poor cleaning. we were upgraded to a superior room when we complained. this room was better and had less of a funearel feel about it but still had that sense of tired furnishing. the bathroom had a shower curtain and was small. interestingly enough, the bathroom of this superior room was half the size of the bathroom of the previous room of lower grade. | good point: room service breakfast was great in comparison to room service breakfast in mandarin oriental in boston, usa. the outside outside terrace was nice but really because of the view to hyde park not actually because of anything the hotel did itself. | astoundingly beyonce, jayz and their entourage were in residence. they were seated on the terrace while we were there about 4 tables away. on taking pictures of one of our party we were told by the waiter not to take photos. minutes later one of the beyonce/jayz crew brought out a giant zoom lens camera nad started taking photos. i immediately complained and asked why it was ok for them to take photos. has it not ocurred to the hotel that people might like to take pictures on holiday. the same waiter later apologised and allowed us to use our camera. | another highlight of the holiday was their understanding of a do not disturb sign. housekeeping actually telephoned our room and asked when they could come to clean the room. i said there is a do not disturb sign there so clearly not now. i called the front desk / duty manager to complain she explained that a do not disturb sign does not mean that housekeeping cannot telephone to ask when they can come to clean teh room and that a do not disturb sign can be placed on the telephone, in any case i found the whole affair ridiculous. a sign saying do not disturb means excatly that. if the housekeeper telephones to say i notice a do not disturb sign is on your door so when can i come to clean, that is just unacceptable. she/he might as well ask for your itinierary so she can plan her housekeeping duties appropriately. i was rather appalled for a hotel of this calibre. they put a bottle of champagne in the room to try to make amends as a result after we returned from our day out. | another disappointment was the knowledge of teh concierge on recommending good restaurants. being a native of london it became quickly clear that i wa sbetter off doing this myself. his suggestions were bizarre places that i never heard of. i was clear in my description of what i wanted he was so far off the mark. i managed to book a lovely restaurant in mayfair myself. he was of absolutely no use and in fact said that he had no influence to try toget bookings that all he could do was telephone them to ask about availability and that was it. | the best thing about this hotel is the location; room service breakfast and the terrace restaurant.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we went to the corinthia hotel for afternoon tea, we are gradually working our way around the top london hotels that serve afternoon tea. | the location for afternoon tea is in the main area of the hotel and it felt a little like paddington station with people walking through, staff having conversations around the area and the general hub of activity in a hotel going on around you. | they catered for me well as i am vegetarian with a dairy allergy, the bread was a little hard but the sandwiches were ok. the cakes were lovely and had been made with alot of care and attention and tasted beautiful. tea was a little disappointing for me as i like loose tea and they used a tea bag which is the first time i have come across this for afternoon tea. but that is a personal preference. | we had a nice afternoon tea but for me a little more ambience away from the hub of the hotel would have been better. thank you for catering for my food preferences and for the staff taking the time to ask and to understand what my needs were. the staff were very helpful and clearly cared about giving a good service'''",1
The Lanesborough,"'''met friends at the lanesborough last weekend for celebratory champagne tea. it was 40 years since we had first met there as student nurses, when it was still st georges hospital. | without doubt, the venue is opulent. we were warmly welcomed, immediately seated and offered bottled water (which was already on the table) whilst we decided what tea to have. | the sandwiches and cakes were nicely presented, but sadly the sandwiches had very little filling. you could hardly tell the difference from one filling to the next, compounded by the fact that they were overpoweringly salty. i thought it was just me, but once we had started on the cakes my friends all agreed the sandwiches were far too salty, but we had all been too polite to say so!! | the cakes were beautifully decorated, light in texture, some almost mousse like. the scones were warm, delicious, and accompanied by good quality strawberry jam and clotted cream. perfect! | good range of teas, but we had to ask several times for the pots to be topped up, and each time we asked we had to wait ages or had to ask again. that said, the fine china and silver tea service really added to the occasion. and the glass of tattinger was excellent. | it was great fun looking around and reminiscing between ourselves, and with some of the staff, about our nursing days there .....the busy casualty downstairs, the horse guards trotting by in the early hours of the morning, the colourful characters (patients, ward sisters and consultants!). happy memories. | all in all we did have a lovely time, but the service was certainly not attentive, which it should have been at an establishment which prides itself on excellence. the sandwiches were dreadful and we were astonished to be charged 11 for the two bottles of water which we had not actually asked for. we had assumed when they were offered, that it was part of our reservation for tea. beware of the 15% service charge that will be added to your bill. | there was chaos at the cloakroom when we handed in our tickets to retrieve our coats. eventually we did get our coats, but the simple system had gone into meltdown. the manager on hand was charming and very apologetic , which was a lovely way to end the afternoon.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed there in august 2012 and found the rooms very ordinary but that was perhaps because the expectation of the hotel was so high. my favourite hotel in the world is the mandarin oriental hk and i expected london to be a close rival but it seems it has a way to go yet, apart from the location. that said, the staff were very professional and friendly and the spa was good.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''while i did not stay in the hotel itself, i was visiting for a business meeting recently. the person i was due to meet was delayed so myself and some colleagues decided a late breakfast would be nice to pass the time. i asked three times in the main foyer lounge for us to be looked after. in the end i fetched a menu myself from behind the desk, only to discover there were no breakfast items on it. | dismayed a colleague went into the bar off the main lounge and thankfully the staff there were more interested in us. the manager found us a table in the main lounge and ordered the coffee and pastries we would been trying to get for over 30 minutes. | when it all arrived it was delicious and very well presented, however the service at such a swanky hotel put me off ever staying there. never had such a problem at claridges. a real shame.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''reserved my twin room through baholidays and neither my 80-year old mother nor i were ever disappointed with the service, our room, the continental breakfast, nor the location. | i have stayed in no fewer than 15 hotels in london and for the price ($144.00) i would definitely return here. i always try to shop for hotels in neighborhoods that are safe after dark, that will not break the bank, and whose amenities satisfy my needs. i am sorry that others submitting their reviews were not pleased with this hotel. our continental breakfast included 4 juices, a variety of breads, cold cuts, cheese, fresh sliced watermelon and casaba melon (this was mid-november), other stewed/canned fruits, hard-boiled eggs, fresh whole tomatoes, coffee, or tea. we ate heartily each morning and compared our offerings to continental breakfasts elsewhere in the world--a step up!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this is a perfectly located hotel, right across from the v&amp;a in a very pleasant, touristy area, so i guess the inflated prices are justified. the foyer and restaurant area are fine, the breakfast is very good- they even make you wait a little bit to get a table just to give you an extra run for your money. food is good though. but the rooms are disappointing, have an old, cheap feeling to them. as if you are in a different hotel then the lobby. so all in all - not sure if it is worth it. this is london however and you will not get good value for your money however much you try.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we are very loyal customers of this hotel. it is a good value for money. it is not the best location as it is on the south bank, but if you do not mind a short tube ride it is ok. going by taxi to and from the hotel to the center is not the best idea. | one thing which i missed was that they have discontinued offering handy. this is a phone which you could take during your stay which offered free calls in the uk and free internet. that is not available any more... | the breakfast is fairly cheap. one of the cheapest in town. | you get stunning views from most of the rooms to the st pauls and the thames. | the rooms are fairly spacious. | i probably would return but cannot help to note that i am much less loyal to this property than before.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''after the other apex up near tower hill, we came to the new one with high expectations. sadly, the hotel had only been open a few days, and our time there was marred with teething problems and a less than optimal response to them from the staff. construction was still going on, so there was a fair bit of the usual residue (dust, noise, paint fumes, etc), and it was clear that a lot of the internal systems were yet to settle down. housekeeping was a problem - after a long day trip to cambridge, we returned to find the room had not been cleaned, and had to call to request it. the following night we returned (after 6pm) to find housekeeping actually in the room, so we had to wait for them to finish. the concept of two towel sets (one bathmat, two bath towels, two hand towels, two facewashers) seemed beyond them and they did not manage to get that right on any of the three nights. | when going downstairs to have a chat to the duty manager about all not going to plan (intending to be somewhat understanding about the teething issues in a brand new hotel but indicating it really was not what we expected from apex) we were fobbed off to the head of reception who seemed to think the solution was complimentary breakfast the next day (when we really just wanted some attention to the deficient areas). | it only hit me on the last day that, in trying to be absolutely perfect, they were putting themselves under so much pressure that they were missing the basics. everyone needed to relax a little and concentrate on getting the important things right. | i would still recommend this hotel if you want a place right in the middle of the city (where it is nice and quiet on weekend but close to everything you will want to see) - judging by other reviews, it looks like they have ironed out some of the initial problems from when they first opened.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''we have just returned from a stay at the savoy where we had cocktails in the american bar and dinner in kaspars and we were so very disappointed with our experience. | the building and dcor are quite superb and our meal in the restaurant was excellent but our praise stops there and i feel sad to have discovered that the savoy is not what it used to be. | just so many things were not right. there was no sense of this hotel being managed and most of the staff were young and inexperienced. | the steam room in the spa was out of order the whole time we were there, the water jets in the swimming pool were broken and the tiles around the edge of the pool were so dirty that we did not feel comfortable swimming. this is the savoy for heavens sake, supposedly one of the best hotels in the world, get the pool cleaned and the steam room fixed !! | we had not booked a room with a river view but we certainly did not expect to be looking out on to pipes covered in pigeon poo. this ugly outlook could so easily have been covered with plants or a screen but no-one had bothered. also, to our surprise, there were no complimentary bottles of water or tea &amp; coffee making facilities in the room. | thank goodness we checked our bill, an error had been made and it was over 200 more than it should have been. | our recommendation - try a different hotel.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''this was my first time at a mandarin oriental and my expectations were high due to the reputation of the hotel chain as well as the nightly rate which is on the high end, even for london. unfortunately my expectations were not entirely met. | let us start off with the positive remarks: | - the staff at the front desk and the door are great. i thoroughly enjoyed entering the hotel and my check in/out experience (coincidentally i was dealing with the same person, a young gentleman, who really stood out with a welcoming and positive attitude. very often staff at 5* properties have a stiffness to them but not in this case) | - breakfast! omg it was so good and also well presented. staff there was lovely too. | - location is really good with close proximity to hyde park, a variety of shopping areas (high end like harrods, but further down on kings road you will find hip and young brands like lululemon, etc). also not too far from buckingham palace, oxford street or park lane) | - good gym | now for the negative points: | - service is a bit spotty (i unexpectedly found a used paper tissue in the pocket of my bathrobe which was disappointing and in fact a bit gross as it indicates to me that i was not wearing a fresh robe, but one that was used by the previous guest - ugh!) | - internet: it is really annoying that a hotel like the mandarin oriental charges for internet. at a rate of 1k usd per night, one would think that this could be built into the nightly rate. it is not like 16gbp is a big deal for someone who pays that much for a room night, but travelers who book this category of hotel do not like to be nickled and dimed and inconvenienced by something silly like that. i cannot even remember the last time i had to pay for internet at any hotel i have stayed in and those range from four seasons down to holiday inn. i am puzzled | - rooms look worn and extremely dated and the windows are tiny which makes the rooms rather dark and gloomy. i was however told that renovations are underway, so hopefully they will update the style. | all in all i was rather disappointed with the experience. i think the most disappointing factor was that there was very little effort to recover the service flaw from the bathrobe incident. most hotels would send a note to the room apologizing for the mishap and perhaps a manager would make an extra effort to engage the guest. in all fairness, the nice front desk agent took the internet charges off my room which i appreciated, however i would have liked a bit more imagination and involvement from the management. | i would likely not return as a guest, considering the hotel choices one has while in london, but i would go back for breakfast.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the rooms are tired and i was somewhat disappointed that clearly we had been put in an older room because it was a a ""corporate"" event. had to request a new room as the first room was two singles?! the second room actually smelled of ""smoke""?! just little things that are overlooked and not quite what one expects to be overlooked in rooms... guest amenities lovely idea.. except that the boxes were actually empty! i was desperate to remove makeup and could not do so! the picture frames in the bathroom had glue stuck across the inside of the frames on two places....? attention to detail please! it was like that when it was put up! | no iron in room ! it is the least i would expect! | breakfast on saturday morning was a fiasco! you should be able to accommodate all,guests staying in the hotel for breakfast! waited 25 minutes for a table and then an hour for food! when my english breakfast arrived it was not as ordered and to be fair waitress took it away immediately! but i then had to wait another 20 minutes for it to be returned... by which time my husband had long finished his meal.... surely it does not take 20 minutes to cook two eggs to well done!? when the plate was retuned it had black pudding on which i had asked specifically not to be included, the mushroom was so dehydrated from sitting in warmer and the beans that were on my previous plate we now missing. | positives: the friendliest fastest checkin! thank you! and my spa treatment with eva? was absolutely perfect! it is such a pity that the other things really let this hotel down. i am not sure if this was isolated i certainly hope so as the mandarin oriental has to be one of the most beautiful old buildings in a perfect location.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''just returned yesterday from a 4 night stay at this hotel. hotel was fresh and clean and the rooms where nice. i would say it was overpriced for the service provided. i have stayed in smaller cheaper hotels and received a much better service. it was also noticeable that english was not the first language of all the staff within the hotel. during our stay here our room was entered one morning just before 8.00am by a maid while we were still in bed sleeping which woke us up, she noticed we were still in our beds and apologised and left. she then done the same thing again an hour later at 9.00am waking us up again. i think this is very inappropriate and was an invasion of our privacy. with that night being hogmanay we decided to eat in our room with both my partner and i ordering a beef madras. the food was served promptly however it was very poor in both quantity and quality. the rice had clearly not been drained before it had been put onto the plate and the sauce was heaped on top. i pushed the sauce on top to the side to separate it from the rice i then noticed that my beef madras curry looked more like soup as the rice was swimming in water. each meal cost 16.50. we began to eat the dinner but quite quickly gave up and called down to reception for the plates are collected. with that night being hogmanay we decided to just have a few drinks in our room and forget about the meal and enjoy the rest of our night. | the next day i raised both issues with management about the maid entering the room and the poor quality of food. management said they would raise the issue with the head of kitchen and head of housekeeping. on checking out of the hotel i spoke to the same manager and said all she could do was apologise and give us advice for future visits. over all the hotel was comfortable and pleasant to stay in, beds were great and room was regularly cleaned. bathroom was nice and towels where changed regularly however we did notice we were only provided with 1 toilet roll and luckily there where also tissues in the room which we had to use when the toilet roll ran out. on arrival to the hotel we were not provided with any additional information about the hotel and its facilities and also about london itself. being a regular traveller i have noticed that on other trips i have been on the hotel have been very helpful and provided us with a map and places of interest. however when we did arrive and checked in we were asked would we like complimentary newspapers or morning wake up calls. i think this hotel should go back to focusing on getting the basics right and then work on the added extras. with regards to location if you are planning on visiting the city of london i would not recommend this hotel as it is not very central. we managed fine with the use of the underground however i would suggest choosing a different hotel as you could find a hotel more central for the same price or even cheaper. if you are planning on taking any drinks or nibbles back to your room ensure you buy them before returning back to the hotel as there is nothing nearby to purchase anything. this was my 5th visit to london and i always enjoy my time there. with my partner paying extra to make our stay more comfortable and luxurious i had much higher expectations which unfortunately did not match up to the service provided.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we chose to stay at this hotel following reading reviews and receiving an excellent rate. as previously mentioned, the rooms are lovely and the location is excellent. my one big disappointed was where our room was positioned. we were on a low floor and the noise from the traffic was intolerable, even at a weekend. our bed was also very hard and uncomfortable. i mentioned the noise of the traffic the following day, when asked by staff at breakfast and they were aware of this problem on lower floors. following departure, i e-mailed the manager of my concerns, which were immediately dismissed infering that they had had no other complaints about these issues. when i further mentioned that the issue of the hard mattress had been previously mentioned on trip-advisor on more than one occassion, although the manager then agreed, i did not receive any apology or compensation. as the issue of the traffic noise was simply dismissed, i did suggest that the manager spent the night in the same room in order to make an informed comment, but as yet am not aware that he has.'''",1
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''i treated myself to a full day at the bulgari spa on a rainy day in london. | overall, the spa is very clean and the staff is friendly. despite being a weekend, i more or less had the pool and whirlpool to myself which was a great way to start the day. | during the day i had several treatments. | my pregnancy massage was great my therapist knew what she was doing and she managed to release pregnancy related tensions. | my facial was ok. however, i had expected much more from a customised facial priced at 210. | i go to spas regularly, and i have had lots of treatments and i never compromise the quality when it comes to my facials. the reason why i wanted to try the bulgari spa was because i expected a very efficient and customized facial. the therapist was really kind and professional. before we started, i told her that my skin really needed a deep cleansing with extraction of all impurities. my therapist analysed my skin, cleansed it with several products and did a bit of extraction. it all felt very nice and relaxing. however, i was rather disappointed when i got home and looked in the mirror to discover that it had not been a truly deep cleanse as i had clearly requested as there was still lots of obvious extraction to be done which was the main reason why i came. | my eyebrow shaping was so-so. i had to request for the middle part of the brows to be shaped too and honestly i get prettier and more aligned results at e.g. blink brow bar. | overall, i had a really good day but you can get better facials in london especially when you are willing to a pay premium. this is a pity, because the spa is so pretty and i would have loved to come there for my regular treatments. but i am not sure as the facial and brow shaping did not live up to my expectations.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''great welcome from the gentleman who was on reception when i checked in. friendly and helpful. room was clean but looked like it needed an update. very uncomfortable mattress and pillow and as i only looking for place to sleep that was not good. bathroom very tight fit but in good condition. best thing is the closeness to paddington station and underground and the central line on lancaster gate. i believe overpriced for what it is but guess paying for location. would not go back, would rather pay little more and get something much better.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i am writing this as a second-hand review as i did not stay there myself - my family bought the sunday best overnight package as a present for my mother for her 80th birthday. i made the booking myself - and that was a complete nightmare. i phoned to make the booking months before her birthday and initially booked the package through the central fairmont reservations team - however it then took about a week of emails and phone calls to the hotel reservations team to finally get the booking done. i wanted to upgrade the room from the standard to a deluxe room and i kept getting conflicting answers to every email about whether this could be done. i have no idea why it was so difficult for them to make the booking - but in the end we got there. | as i would made the booking many months before the actual stay, and because the booking experience was so disorganised, i phoned again the week before my mother's stay to reconfirm everything - at that time i explained again that it was my mother's 80th birthday the day of her stay, and a lifelong dream of hers to be staying at the hotel, and the person i spoke to said this was noted on the booking. i really hoped that the hotel might make a small gesture to acknowlege this: at the very least a ""happy birthday"" from the check-in staff; at most maybe a piece of cake and a note in her room - but absolutely nothing. i was so disappointed. i had expected that a hotel of this class would have paid attention to details like that - and they let themselves down on this occasion. | regarding the actual stay, my mother was pleased with the hotel - she said the bed was incredibly comfortable and the waitress at breakfast was charming. she thought the hotel did not seem to enforce the dress code - lots of people wearing shorts and trainers which was a bit off-putting. | overall, it was a pleasant stay for her, but not the really special occasion we had all envisaged which was such a shame.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i stayed at the mondrian for 1 night with my partner. the hotel and facilities are very new and swanky - loved it! i found the attentiveness of the staff in the lobby pretty lacking upon arrival. we got a superior room with a river view. the room was nice and large with a lovely view but it had such a small bed! most disappointing of all was the fact that we had a disabled bathroom, which no one had mentioned to us. this bathroom basically remembered a public disabled toilet with marble floors and no bath! so disappointed. for the price we paid it would have at least been nice to have been told prior to booking what our bathroom would be like. i may come back to the restaurant but i probably will not come back to the hotel.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i was looking for a cheap, clean hotel close to a metro station and the shopping areas king's road, marylebone, regent street, etc and chose this hotel after reading the positive reviews here. first of all, the location is convenient and the hotel and room were clean. the bathroom was quite small, but modern. the twin room itself was also small (a bit too small to our liking and we did not have a view so that did not help), but the beds were comfortable and the room was quiet. we slept well although it was a bit warm due to the fact that we could not turn off the heating completely because the knob was stuck and we did not want to use the airco. | breakfast was not very interesting, the ladies were very friendly but the food and coffee/tea just were not very tasty. on the other hand it is complementary and if you are okay with toast and jam or yoghurt and muesli i guess you are alright. | next time when i am staying in london with i will look for another place, there is not much wrong with rhodes hotel, but i do not think it is a 'little gem' either.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''booked the sunday night special - upgraded room, dinner and breakfast included - 375 plus service. room was good, with view over the thames, extra comfortable bed. however shared access door meant we heard noise from the adjoining room. dinner in the river restaurant was diabolicle - i could not finish the starter (grossly overcooked) or the main course (undercooked). the cheese board consisted of 5 slivers of unrecognisable cheese, but was the highlight of the meal. breakfast (33 if you were not a resident), continued the theme - cold pastries, bacon that had more fat than bacon. a single sausage that no-one could contemplate eating. scrambled eggs were great. 3 stars is generouus. there is a thing going around that these ""special offers"" produce inferior product - in my experience, this may be true.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''i stayed in this hotel for 3 nights during the olympics...aug 8th to 11th. having read the reviews in advance i was somewhat nervous as to what to expect! honestly i was pleasently surprised. | it is not the ritz but there again you are not paying for the ritz! | great location for access to olympic park...bus stop right outside...handy to tube station so easy access to city centre. | clean room...nice sheets...2 comfortable single beds in my room...slept like a log. reasonable bathroom...hot and cold water...nice little comfortable bath and shower above it. could not fault it. tv in room...kettle...tea and coffee. if i was to fault anything it would be the carpet. being n asthmatic i hate carpets...but i did not react to it so they obviously hoovered it well. | the breakfast was ok....cereal, &amp; full english breafast. no fruit or yoghurt though. | the staff were superb! i was treated like a queen by them. i will specifically mention ali, kunal &amp; lawford. overall it was a lovely experience. would i stay there again...yes. value for money...good location..great staff! yes they could improve the place but it is nothing like previous reviews state. you get what you pay for. thank you to all the staff of the newham for a great stay! donna (ireland)'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''room was tiny, as expected for the price. location was excellent. full english breakfast included, but we got bored with the same items every single day. staff were helpful with directions. wi-fi worked pretty well, and they do have 2 computers in the parlor for guests to use to print boarding passes as needed. bathroom was antiquated and had problems with a toilet that flushed only sporadically. we were told that was because of 60 years of ""abuse"" by americans! okayyyy.... otherwise the hotel was a good bargain. the beds were tiny single beds, but were comfortable otherwise. lots of street noise because it is located near a hospital so heard sirens all night. earplugs solved that problem easily. we were unable to book into the same hotel for our return to london a week later, so we set out to find another and found our dream!'''",1
The Lanesborough,"'''having stayed at le bristol (the oekter collection's hotel in paris) a number of times over the last few years and found it to be the absolute benchmark to which other hotels should aspire, i had high hopes for their relatively new addition in london. | ** location ** | at hyde park corner at the foot of park lane, it is just across the road to the park and a short walk from knightsbridge. personally i prefer the quiet of mayfair over the busy road in which its main entrance is unfortunately located. | ** arrival ** | good first impressions of the staff, with attentive porters efficiently taking care of luggage and escorting me to the reception. within a few moments, the receptionist escorted me to the suite - providing a brief tour en-route. public areas are beautifully appointed in a light fresh regency style, and the hotel has a very welcoming relaxed atmosphere. | ** rooms ** | kindly upgraded, the junior suite was beautifully decorated, very well maintained and appointed, however felt on the smaller side - perhaps as a result of the low ceilings (on level 3). one of the butler team was there to welcome me, providing an orientation of the room and offer of welcome tea/coffee. in terms of the room, there was a small foyer, bathroom with separate shower, and bedroom, sitting room &amp; study area combined on a raised level. the bath towels are great (huge and very soft). the sleep quality was good. the hair dryer did not work - on request a replacement was obviously provided. there were limited toiletries in the room (quite standard with most premium hotels) - on requesting dental &amp; shaving kits both were quickly delivered, albeit had the appearance of just having been obtained from the nearest convenience store. turndown service standard, however with the bed covering bizarrely being placed in a bag at the window in plain site on opening the curtains in the morning. | ** spa ** | in contact with the hotel prior, i had booked a hot stone massage. on arrival at the spa i was then advised the spa was closed due to extension work. the massage was in a (small) guest room on level 4 of the building - the bed having been replaced with a massage table. the therapist was very apologetic &amp; the treatment was very good, however overall relaxing spa experience largely non-existent. also, on a 85 minute treatment the ambient music repeated several times. discussing the lack of a spa with the duty manager later they acknowledged that guests should be notified prior. certainly for myself, when on a short city break a spa is a major consideration - i would not have booked having known there was no spa. on checkout, the receptionist offered a small deduction and i also received a subsequent email from the director. | ** main bar ** | beautifully appointed, with a delightful old world feel. mid-afternoon the main hotel bar was very enjoyable, and quiet - with a friendly and knowledgeable staff member. there was an impressive selection of cognac and whisky (even my favourite silent whisky distillery). inadequate staffing however, given on leaving i had to go looking for a staff member who in turn had to locate another as they did not work in the area. and, surprisingly, lacked the personal touch when settling your bill (room number and name did not suffice - a signature was required) - inconsistent with the restaurant and spa, and indeed almost every other premium hotel. evening drinks - the bar was busy and quite noisy (indeed arriving at 7pm on a tuesday you would struggle to obtain a table). service was slow and inattentive, aside from asking what i wanted without first providing a drinks menu. | ** garden bar ** | there is a separate garden bar (covered outdoor venue on the lower level of the building providing a smoking area). i am a big whisky fan, and the knowledge of their staff was impressive. very good service. | ** restaurant ** | see separate review - in summary an excellent dinner, however rather average breakfast. | ** other minor observations ** | - signage is largely lacking in public areas (indeed some staff even appear to have difficulties attempting to locate the elevators when first leaving my room, i asked a member of housekeeping and was advised she did not know as she was new). | - asking the operator to put me through to the front desk resulted in the bathroom phone then ringing, and front desk answering but not being able to hear me (repeated twice before the operator offered to assist directly). | - a number of times, when attempting to call concierge or housekeeping, i received an automated press 5 and well call you back message with the line then cutting off (not ideal when you are looking to speak with someone then &amp; there). | | ** overall ** | over the last few years i have been fortunate to have stayed at most of london's top hotels (including savoy, langham, claridge's, dorchester, cafe royal, brown's, the connaught - all with spas), and for the time being at least my current hotel preference in the capital remains unchanged. | all said, please do try their restaurant for dinner - for me it is a little bit of paris (with a london twist). | room tips: | - entry level rooms have queen sized beds. king sized beds are available in executive rooms, and higher. | - my room was located on level 3. it appears that the lower levels (2 at least) have higher ceilings.'''",1

Newham Hotel,"'''needed to be in east london, so just picked an averaged price hotel that provided breakfast. was a bit concerned when i read the reviews, but it was only for a few nights. i was surprised by the standard of the rooms, large, comfy beds and clean bathrooms, but disappointed with no air conditioning- not something you always need in uk, but we just happened to be in the middle of a heat wave! breakfast was very good, fresh and unlimited. my main disappointment was that there were riots outside the hotel in the evening, and through the night, so police would not let us out, due to the street fires i had to close the window, which made the room very warm, the hotel did not offer any help with situation.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''our family of four stayed in rooms 227 and 228 for a week at the end of november. yes, the rooms are small and showing signs of wear. there was some peeling paint in the bathroom, and the beds and pillows were not very comfortable. we had a problem in the mornings with the shower alternating between hot and cold. on the positive side, there is plenty of storage space for unpacking, and because we had a mini-refrigerator/freezer we were able to save some money on food. when we checked in to the rhodes, maria told us that we would get the full english breakfast for no extra cost (it is usually an additional 3 pounds per person). it was a very good and filling hot breakfast of eggs and meat. the owners are excellent hosts who helped us out with problems and even let us make a free phone call. we felt like we were staying in someone is home instead of in a hotel. this was a 3-star hotel with 4-star service. the location is convenient for tube/train travel and for restaurants. be sure to stroll in nearby hyde park. for 70 pounds per room per night, we felt we got a good deal. by the way, we recommend taking the tube from heathrow to paddington. you will save lots of money and see more of the london area, but you will have to haul your luggage up some steps.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we went to tea at the savoy recently - what a lovely place it is, pretty, comfortable, rather like a garden room. we had the high tea option. given that it ended up costing 60 per head with one glass of champagne and restriction on the amount of decent tea we could drink, that the cake was sliced off a larger one and put on a plate, that the crumpets were not dripping with butter and the scrambled egg was hard i did not feel it was good value and would not recommend it to anyone else as a treat. i have had afternoon tea in hotels around the world, in country house hotels and other london hotels and this was certainly the least good value for money.'''",1
Newham Hotel,"'''i would like to start by saying that this hotel was good value for money, especially considering how late we booked. i would have liked to have given a 3.5, as opposed to a 3, but alas i cannot! | we had three rooms, two of which were on the ground floor. one of these faced onto the main road and as we had the windows open, there was a lot of road noise, but we did sleep decently on the second night when we shut half the windows. the bathroom was spacious and the room was comfortable and clean. the second room was also a little noisy, but again we slept well, though it was a smaller room with a very small bathroom. the third room was upstairs and was more spacious again. | some of the dcor was a little run down and there was dust on top of the wardrobe, but the linen and bathrooms were clean and that was the important thing. the staff were very friendly and happy to help us, and we had an enjoyable stay. the free breakfast did include cooked options and while not the most adventurous or extensive of things, was also much appreciated. | i have been very lucky with other budget hotel stays, but provided you expect no frills and do not mind if things are a touch run down here and there on a cosmetic level, this hotel is good value and full of lovely people, which is to be much valued. they also have free parking, which is again much appreciated. | overall, a good budget establishment, many thanks to all the staff =]'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,'''first we did not feel comfortable in the standard triple room being so small in which we were almost making a bump dance. the day after they have changed our room to deluxe triple room with a sofa. newly refurbished room contains jacuzzi as well. the boss says that his hotel has the best refurbished baths in the sussex gardens area. high ceilings and air escape from the window make the room very cold. the heater's panel is so large but only heats itself. the fan they brought was most powerful heater i have seen. it was enough to make the room warm. the breakfast room was tiny. the boss has plans to enlarge it in the very near future. variety of breakfast was not so satisfactory. the last day the boss prepared omlette and served specially for us. it was a nice gesture from the boss nearly 35 yrs in the hotel business.''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''selected this hotel from hotels.com for a weekend getaway. the location is superb, and the general state of this modern hotel is well above average; however, the rumpus room bar is extremely busy so do not expect a table or seat unless you book ahead. the restaurant staff were excellent and the food was good - my criticism from the bar area is that the prices are well above average. e.g 5.50 for a bottle of heineken is not value for money, so take advantage of the location and find a good bar close by (there are plenty).'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''hotel is in a great location, about 2 blocks from paddington station. however be prepared to deal with stairs. we stayed in the annex which is around the corner and down a fairly long block from the main hotel. our room was on the 4th floor (5th floor to americans) with a narrow staircase and no lift. breakfast is only served in the main hotel and is downstairs. good breakfast. not a good choice if you use a cane and impossible for wheelchair users. the manger did carry our suitcases to our room. small room but quiet.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i love afternoon tea, you could say i am an addict! i also love the mandarin! i love the bar, the cocktails, the food, the staff and the rooms! but i did not love the experience of their afternoon tea. i took my mum on a saturday afternoon around 3pm, it was busy but not overly so. seating was comfortable, if a little ""hotel reception"" style (the chairs vary as do the tables and decor across the room, ask for a table in the window area if you can) | staff were generally friendly and efficient although one lady did seem to resent being there and never uttered a single word even when spoken to when pouring tea or removing plates etc | the food was good and plentiful but a little slow to come out. i did find it odd that the sandwiches and cake/pastry was served together before the scones but maybe that is just me. | what i found appalling was watching a member of staff ""reset"" a table after a group had left. instead of removing the remaining table settings and spraying and wiping the table she just pushed the unused items to the side and wiped around the table with what appeared to be a brown frayed looking cloth before adding whatever cutlery etc to finish the table setting!! | i work in the service industry and would love to see environmental health's take on that cleaning routine!!! i know the plates/cutlery make look unused but honestly people had touched it and moved it around! reset the table and clean it!! | i for one would hate to think that was the standard for the mandarin! it is not what i expected from a 5 star hotel and both my mother and i were disgusted. | i may stay in the hotel again but i honestly will think twice about eating there myself or recommending the afternoon tea or any food to anyone. | such a shame as my mother was so looking forward to the tea and it was tainted by such unprofessional practices.'''",1

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we visited the hotel several times over a week as our close friends from asia were staying with their extended family. although the rooms were impressive we were shocked to see adults drinking all day in the bar and getting quite loud. when we went to take the children swimming we were told that there were strict limits on when they could visit as 'the adults do not like children in the pool'. after being given a grudging 15 minutes i saw why. the atmosphere in the spa was more like a sex club than a health club with darkened areas and some dubious looking 'couples' . we could not get milkshakes for the children when we asked for them and we paid a massive 25 for the tiniest portion of lobster i have ever had in the restaurant. the waiters were lacking in knowledge regarding wine and food, telling our friends that sorrel sauce was 'like wasabi'! the excellent breakfasts and service notably fell off in the afternoon and evening when everything began to look rather shabby. | while waiting for a taxi outside we were heckled by drunken residents and watched as a number of men with ear pieces and dark glasses were whisked away in a number of cars. all in all it was quite sleazy despite the extortiate amount of money they charge. very poor and how unlike the wonderful 'milestone' hotel which we had all stayed at previously.'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i came here for afternoon tea with a friend around christmas time. the hotel itself is stunning and the restaurant where the tea was served was beautifully decorated. the tea itself was good but i have tasted better. the finger sandwiches were fairly standard and quite pleasant to eat. the cakes had clearly been made with a lot of attention to detail but this did not always translate into the taste. unfortunately, as vegetarians, we could not sample some of the cakes because they contained gelatine and this limited our choice. if you do not have specific dietary preferences, i would suggest you try this for a special occasion, however i do not think i would visit again.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we stayed at rhodes for 3 nights and generally found it to be quite satisfactory. the room was in a great central location, small, but modern and clean. service was good and the room was made down daily without issue. breakfast was simple but quite good. the only problem we had was wifi access. our room was downstairs, an wifi was patchy at best. unfortunately reception was less than helpful dealing with this. wifi was quite important for us and this issue reduced our rating from a 5 to a 4.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel seems to be mainly for older folks, perhaps with kids at imperial college. the breakfast was so-so but edible. the room was a standard business traveler room with quite a nice bath and jets. the wifi was solid and the staff helpful. the hotel is located right near the piccadilly line and across from the victoria and albert museum and the london science museums. great place to just get some sleep.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''we have stayed here a few times but this last visit the hotel has fallen down in repair it needs updating but the service and the people cannot be topped it certainly is the best for service except for the small restaurant downstairs. the location is excellent right near the tube and shopping but as soon as they upgrade the hotel it will be top notch again''',1
Newham Hotel,"'''i do not know what people want from 2* hotel..??? i stayed for 3night. my room was clean,was tea,coffe,kettle, everything was what need for room. shower was clean and worked normal. oll staff was frendly and polite. breakfast was normal,english. just missed some fruits,but ok.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''xenia has lots going for it: convenient location, edgy decor and some great room features. the restaurant is potentially very good too. but that is the lament of this review: unfulfilled potential. staff are well-intentioned but lack consistent direction; rooms are well-finished and bathrooms are state of the art but service is maddeningly patchy. and some of us still think pillows should be stuffed with feathers not rubber. the restaurant is high on price but low on value - eg toast with your breakfast egg costs 3.00 extra and porridge (instant, in a supermarket tub) an outrageous 10. worst of all, the pr blurb is self-indulgent hype, not borne out by any worthwhile evidence of real hospitality or professional competence. it could be great...but it needs to go back to school and learn how to give real value and service, with authentic courtesy. oh and by the way, perfumed loo roll is really not classy...'''",1

Newham Hotel,'''i booked for one night the room and toilet were clean but no kettle they bought one when asked the fridge is not working so i had to put my stuff in the reception fridge the huge problem is the noice avoid the rooms facing the main road you can hear people's talking in the road and too much traffic noice even at early houres of morning the breakfast is ok i would recommend this hotel if it is less noisy''',1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we have arrived today to what is a treat for our wedding anniversary. although a little early for the 3pm check in we were assured no later than 3pm to get to our room. all our details were taken etc. after a short walk we came back at 3pm to be told no rooms were available yet and ""it is a new hotel and very busy"". we were offered a complimentary drink in the bar and that someone would come get us shortly. as you can imagine over an hour later nobody came! we had to ask again to get in our room. only to be told our room was not ready yet and that ""it is a new hotel""!! i think my look and sound of exasperation made a difference and we were soon offered a room. the bar and room are very nice.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''great location right opposite the v&amp;a with a grand front to the building. we were given a room adapted for the disabled despite not having disabilities, and although this may have meant more room, it also meant a walk in shower with a curtain rather than a screen. the curtain got drawn to you while showering and the walk in nature meant the bathroom floor got soaked! other than this the room was clean with nice black out curtains, but with a relatively small on the wall tv. the major drawback for us was the dining facilities. after walking through a nice bar area with an open fire you enter the dining room which is a large brightly lit conference room type space with absolutely no atmosphere. we had pre booked a table to dine here on a saturday night, but as soon as we saw the room along with the fact that it was empty (no other guests eating on a saturday night says it all), brightly lit and with zero atmosphere, we cancelled and walked to one of the many lovely restaurants nearby. breakfast was again in this conference style room, with a buffet, and although the food was good, there was no atmosphere and we felt it was no better than a travelodge style establishment in this respect. in summery then, great location, ok room, poor dining experience.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i would have loved to give this hotel 4/5 stars because of the staff, the hotel itself and for its location 2 tube stations are within easy walking distance. | the staff were all very helpful and pleasant during our stay. | the hotel itself is amazing. | but, there are problems, some of which can be i am sure can be resolved . | for the first time ever we did not eat breakfast at the hotel we were staying. 25 is just too expensive for leisure travellers. i know you can prebook but i was unable to do so on the hotel website, again this may have been due to teething problems with the site as i had difficulty in even making a booking (some of the site was in latin ???). | housekeeping was patchysometimes there was no coffee in the room and sometimes no milk. although i have to say the standard of cleaning was excellent. | the main problem, as has been said before is room size. | we stayed in room 406, which i believe is a deluxe room, both bedroom and bathroom was very small. the bathroom as really well appointed but there was not a spare shelf to set a toilet bag on. the bedroom was extremely narrow just more than a double beds width. the bed was up tight against the wall on one side with approx. 18 inches free apace down the other side. but the main problem was the sloping roof i do not know how many times i hit my head getting in/out of bed. my wife really banged her head in the middle of the night and was left with a bad bump. | so i am afraid its 3 stars only, which is a real pity. we would go to london 2/3 times per year and i would only consider staying here again if i could afford a bigger room.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i would like to give it 3.5 stars. we stayed in a deluxe room and it was small but clean and comfortable. the in room nespresso machine was a nice upgrade. the location is okay (with two convenient tube stations a few blocks away) but on a street so we were subject to noisy super cars cruising the road late at night. the service was friendly but did take 30 minutes and 3 call to get a bucket of ice at 22:30. the breakfast is okay with good coffee! on a side note as an american the french toast is not what you would expect but rather just buttered toast, very odd and not with 14.'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''there was a lot of confusion about whether my booking/room type included access to the pool. resulted in me having to forward confirmation via email which luckily i had after phoning up and asking for it the day before. very unprofessional that the staff did not know their own rates properly. facilities and breakfast were good.''',1
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel is definitely central to a,few,major museums and restaurants, harrods and shops nearby. piccadilly line also close which is the main tube for most tourists.this is an old hotel that had victorian vibes and a great restaurant back in 2004, my first stay. this time breakfast was included it was buffet style and not very inspiring. whatever happened to scones with jam and clotted cream? seems to have disappeared from much of london's eateries as well as the famous desserts with custard, so loved that! anyhoo, the place is clean, well-run, and will meet your expectations if 4 and 5 star hotels are too astronomical. | i miss the old style but the walls of the place were completely impregnated with centuries of smoking. now all is fresh and breathable. altogether a good safe choice for us middle class travelers'''",1
The Dorchester,'''first time visitor to the dorchester and was really expecting the wow factor! i have stopped in numerous five star hotels through london and the world but i would not rank this in my top 5 never mind top 10. | its got the history but to me that is about it and boy do they know how to charge! we had a meal for 4 in the promenade which was as expensive as a top class michelin star resturant but no were near as good! | the staff were ok but should be more attentive especially when they charge a service charge just to pore a drink! | the room was ok but no where worth the price that was charged. my mother found a dirty sock in her room along with no shower soaps. she did not complain at the time as she did not want to get anyone into trouble which obviously i was not happy about especially at the price of these rooms they should be immaculate. if anything our room was well overpriced and had no views at all. i looked out over a wall! | simply there are better hotels in london which are more reasonable priced five start hotels. i get really annoyed when hotels charge nearly the price of a bottle of spirt for a shot! i know this is a 5 star hotel but surely you do not have to rip people off!''',1
The Savoy,"'''stayed here recently and with all the hype around the opening and the brand savoy itself i was looking forward to my stay. | firstly the hotel does not have a reception desk. the staff use earpieces and do the checking in while walking me to my room. i only found that out after i aksed an extremly rude concierge who did not bother to look at me from his laptop. i guess it must have been an interesting website he was looking at. | the hotel itslef looks lovely, the food is great and the rooms comfortable. | i was very let down by the staff who do not smile or offer much assistance with anything. the overall feeling i walked away with was that everything seemed like a lot of trouble; not something you would expect from savoy or a 5* hotel. | with so many amazing hotels in london i defenitely will not be rushing back.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed overnight for a training course and whilst the public rooms are tasteful and modern in decor the bedroom was far from it. i have to say, it was clean and tidy and given i had not paid myself it was fine for one night but i would not chose to stay again if i were paying. breakfast was good and the choice was huge but no a la carte which is a shame. i was most impressed with the concierge who parked my car for me after i struggled to find a car park for half an hour. i pulled up to ask where i could go and he offered to park it for me. something not exactly offered as part of the service but very much appreciated.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we stayed here a couple of nights around christmas. having never been to london, we were not sure what to expect, but based on reviews, price, location and availability, we booked here. the location was perfect for us. we were able to walk just about everywhere (20 minutes to trafalgar square, 15 minutes to st pancras, with luggage). | the price was right, one of the most affordable places we found. they do not have online booking, so you have to email them. it is a bit of a pain, but it is how they do things... | the rooms were..... fine. nothing special, good or bad. small, but seemed clean. we were not in london to stay in the hotel, so they worked. they have free wifi, which we appreciated. | we did not try the breakfast. wanted to but slept through it after catching up on jetlag. | overall, we thought it was pretty decent. hard to be too excited about it, but the location was great, the rooms were warm, and the price was right.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i think this is a 4 star hotel pretending to be a 5 star. the rooms are fairly sized, but there is nothing special about them. if you are going to stay here i would recommend getting a room with a view of the river thames as to be frank the views from the other rooms are awful. we visited the rooftop bar (rumpus room) which is worth a visit for the views but watch out for the arrogant doorman.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed at the mondrian for 3 nights in a standard room to celebrate my 30th birthday in london... we wanted somewhere special for my birthday celebrations. | the positives.... | the hotel is in a perfect location and the exterior and interior is extremely impressive. the room was modern, clean and the standard bathroom was a fantastic size. we had a city view which was lovely at night to look out of. the room was comfortable. | the staff in the restaurant + cocktail bar were extremely friendly... the food in the restaurant was to a high standard and i was given a birthday dessert with candle. | we were also given a discount voucher for a return visit to the hotel...this would encourage people to return there. | the negatives.... | on arrival the lady on reception was not helpful, we could hear another couple being told about the cinema and bars etc... yet we did not get this information...it felt like 'she could not be bothered'.. also my partner emailed prior to our arrival for champagne in our room for a surprise for my birthday... there was non in the room on arrival... when we returned later that evening... the champagne was there...even though he had requested on arrival. | we were also disappointed with the lack of choice with hot drinks in the room and this was not topped up on one occassion... for this type of hotel we did expect more choice. | overall a mixture of positive and negatives.....'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''this hotel has some strong benefits and a few drawbacks. | -benefits - good location. | you are located very near to hyde park and two tube lines. | -continental breakfast is included in your stay. | - 4 person room available | negative - lots of stairs, narrow stair case with luggage and no elevator. | breakfast room was really small. the staff was nice but the tables are cramped and at times hard to move about. | we had a problem with the air conditioner in the room which the hotel immediately took action to fix.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i was expecting something else from the savoy, recently restored/renovated iconic london landmark. our stay started with an excellent welcoming from the front office representative and a lovely night sleep. the bed is exceptionally comfortable. | now, the bathtub is the old fashion one which makes it difficult to get in and out. i honestly cannot imagine my parents getting in and out without experiencing some kind of difficulty. apart from that the room is nice, nothing special. | the breakfast in the main restaurant is under average for a five star hotel. it starts with the hostess taking a booking for the evening at 7.30am in the morning and keeping us waiting meanwhile her main job at this time of the day is to escort guests to their table. as a consequence, we could not finish breakfast (also due to very slow service) and had to rush to our meeting. the poached eggs were very vinegary, the spinach of the florentine eggs were fresh but tasteless. coffee was nice. i do not recommend breakfast, expensive for what it is. | i will just add the fire alarm ringing twice in the middle of the night (around 1am) and obviously waking us up. i called the reception and then concierge and then reception again and nothing. no answer, no explanation the next day. nothing. strange way of dealing with the incident. | the hotel is ok but nothing special. disappointed.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''this hotel is nice, good location, friendly staff and nice dcor. my only issue was the tiny bathroom and bedroom and also the length of the beds. close by to south kensington and knightsbridge, with many restaurants nearby makes this hotel ideal. however due to its central location you loose out on space. the bathroom was one of the smallest i have seen, bedroom was also tiny with no space to walk.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the location of this hotel is convenient with restaurants very close by and the tube nearby (about an 8 minute walk). maria was helpful with directions, suggestions on sightseeing and best bets for transportation. our room was small but arranged in such a way that it was comfortable for 2 adults and 2 kids. however, the room was at the very top of about 4 flights of pretty steep stairs (84 steps - my kids counted). there were even more steps down to the breakfast nook in the basement - the breakfast was only ok - with an extra charge of 3 pounds for a full english breakfast.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the hotel is on a great location for shopping in knightsbridge. but then there are many hotels in the area, some only 2-3 minutes walk from the mandarine for much less and even half the price. the rooms are not that spacious and i never spend a lot of my time in the hotel anyway, so i cannot see any advantages for spending so much more. it is good service but not amazing and it does feel like a huge hotel, impersonal.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''hotel is very trendy and nicely designed, but once you get past this its probably not worth the price (then again, in london what hotel is?). the ground floor restaurant is average - the breakfast was really nothing special and is expensive. when we were there there was constant noise from construction in the office floors above the hotel. the management tried to tell us it was because of the building next door even though it was obviously coming from the floors above the hotel. the bar on the main floor evidently wins awards for the best cocktails, but again, the cocktails were nothing special coming from north america. | the management was friendly and helpful and the bar on the top floor is excellent. the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. if you find a deal on a room then go for it. but at regular price there are better options.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''rhodes is an adequate hotel. on arrival at the hotel, we were walked round the block to the second living quarters and were given a room in the basement which had three beds squeezed into it - surreal given i would asked for a double room. | room was clean, bed was conformable; however bathroom was tiny. the lock on the door seemed a bit dodgy, and gave the impression someone at some point had broken into the room, which did not leave me feeling particular secure when leaving the room. | location excellent for paddington. service fine, did not stay to sample the food. price was good value.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''firstly, the location was excellent - close to paddington station and tube, good selection of restaurants and shops available, easy to catch bus tours etc. i was able to get around london with ease. | very security conscious - with cameras in all the common areas | the reception staff were very friendly and helped with the luggage when i arrive | i stayed in the annex around the corner - which i admit i did not realise there was an annex when i booked - or that i would be located there. very narrow stairs and no lift. | room was very small - almost uncomfortably small. bathroom was also very small - strangely had a very large shower compared to the size of the room. | walls very thin - i could hear the neighbours talking etc. also i had a street view - which on one hand was lovely to see the sights of london, and on the other very noisy.... | also felt very uncomfortable when i realised that the cleaner (hopefully it was the cleaner) was using the bathroom in my room and not flushing the toilet after themselves.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''stay was everything you would expect from staying at a hotel like the savoy, except for 1 thing - the noise. | noise coming from the function room could be heard from the rooms, 6 floors above. when the hotel was notified the response was apologetic but you would have to wait until 1am when the function was scheduled to finish - unacceptable! | on a minor note, 2 false fire alarms went off during my stay. better to be safe then sorry though! | the hotel has written to me to apologised and promised to look after me next time; however there will need to be something more substantial to get me as a return customer'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''i decided to spend a night here with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. i chose this hotel after timeout reviews of the best 5 star hotels in london. what is good? there is definite style in the design of the hotel and there is a clever maritime theme. apart from that i found the staff generally not very helpful and i seemed to have to explain each time that i had booked a package including room breakfast and dinner. what makes a five star experience is the attitude of staff- they need to be more helpful and more responsive. the one night cost me near 500 and the only thing they could muster to make it 'special' is a small bowl of cut fruit in syrup. currently i am at a hotel in turkey where the contrast in staff attitude is as wide as the bosphorus.i do not think i will be returning.''',1

Rhodes Hotel,"'''i stayed in london for a few days and wanted to be close to paddington station without paying an arm and a leg. the room was small, but that is what i was expecting. the bathroom was nicely renovated. the jacuzzi bathtub was exciting but when i got it going, a weird smell came up, sort of like an old shampoo smell. i guess it was my fault for not ""rinsing"" the tub before using it. the walls were a bit thin, i could hear my neighbours all evening but i was tired and fell right asleep. there was a small patio that faced the street. i would have enjoyed it more, if there were not smokers near by. the breakfast was pretty good. i only had it once, but there was lot of variety. the only things i was not a fan of was that there was no safe in the room and that you had to leave your key at the front desk if you left the property. i would stay here again, but only for a night or 2.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''i was walking past the savoy hotel recently when i noticed an inviting looking pastry shop attached to the hotel. there are no listings on trip advisor yet as it has only been open for about 2 weeks. | you are greeted by two friendly and well presented staff members and a gorgeous array of tempting eclairs such as orange and passionfruit, with the cream being flavoured with orange rather than the traditional plain cream of a standard eclair. there were around 8 different ones to choose from. unfortunately the name and idea of this cake does not live up to expectation. it was very sweet and actually rather tasteless. such a shame as the concept is brilliant.'''",1
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''the bulgari hotel is a beautiful property in the heart of knightsbridge. hotel is exquisitely decorated and in a wonderful location. we arrived at 7:30 am requested an early check in which was completely ignored. our room was not available until 2:30 pm. after a long flight we were not even offered a beverage. we were told by the front desk agent rita that we could wait downstairs in the spa area and that someone would notify us when the room would be ready. we decided to go out and upon return at 2:00 pm the room was still not available. the front desk agent rita was very rude when i questioned when the room would be available. she was quick to answer me in a very derogatory manner which i found to be unprofessional. | the room was decorated beautifully, however very dusty. we reserved a room with two queen beds and were assigned a room with two double beds which was quite uncomfortable since we were three people. | we had booked two restaurant reservations with the concierge. they managed to get us a table at a popular restaurant in town and took the liberty of changing our reservation time, notifying us just one hour prior. very irresponsible. | we dined at the hotel restaurant one afternoon and the server was quite friendly and the food was very fresh and tasty yet quite pricey. | upon checkout we were not even asked about our stay nor received a ""thank you for staying with us."" we frequently visit london but will not be returning to this hotel. we did not feel welcome.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''my partner and i stayed at the xenia over the weekend of 18/19th may to celebrate my birthday. we were very impressed when we first arrived at the hotel, the reception area was beautifully decorated and the staff were very helpful and even let us check in 1 1/2 earlier than we were supposed to. we were quite shocked when we got to our room though, it was tiny! we had paid a bit extra to have a superior room, and thank god we did. it meant we had a terrace off our room so when the curtains were opened it helped to make the room look slightly more spacious. going to bed in the evening was challenging though. one side of the bed was up against the wall which meant that every time i needed to get out of bed (to go to the toilet or something) i had to climb down to the foot of the bed to get out, which was not easy in the dark. that said, the room was very nicely decorated but we did not get our slippers or bath robes that were stated in the room description, there was also a large, opened packet of doritos | left in the desk draw which we could only assume were from the previous guest, so i am not sure how thorough the housekeeping regime actually is. the next morning housekeeping were very loud outside our room (talking) and woke us up on numerous occasions, i think perhaps they need to learn to be slightly more considerate of their surroundings, as i certainly do not appreciate being woken up at 7.30 on a sunday morning unnecessarily. | having said all that i would stay at this hotel again but would have to pay more for a bigger room, as the one we had really would have been more suited to the borrowers.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''first impressions of the hotel were disappointing. the decor is faded and old fashioned. the ""superior"" twin room we were allocated had the smallest bathroom we have ever had in a hotel room - space to get in and no more! the reception staff gave us the choice of two other rooms which had slightly larger bathrooms, but in one of them a bed was right against a window and in the other was against a wall, so we decided to stay in the room they gave us as there was nothing better offered. however, the location of the hotel is ideal. it is opposite the v&amp;a museum, and therefore within walking distance of shops, hyde park, the underground etc. there are bars and restaurants in the vicinity. the hotel has a spacious lounge area and breakfast was fine. overall, we expected better for what we paid, but the location is certainly a bonus. staff were friendly and helpful. we had a room on the fifth floor, facing the back of the hotel and it was very quiet. would we go back? probably, if we got a good price.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''my husband and i booked our room using a corporate rate, so there was no surprise when we got a tiny room with no view. according to other reviews and the hotel website's pictures, there are much nicer rooms than we had! the ceilings were high and the bathroom was a very good size which made the room feel less cramped. the decor was also very nice. the renovation turned out beautifully. the lobby and tea room and all common areas are very classic and lovely. | the location of the hotel is great, particularly if you are doing a lot of sightseeing or seeing a show. if you plan to shop a lot, i would recommend staying a little farther west. | the service did not impress me. at check in when i asked for an upgrade they looked at me like i had 3 heads. i get upgrades all the time at other hotels. it is not a strange question. the concierge who we dealt with the most was around our age (28-30) and really seemed to turn his nose up at us. i am not sure if it is because we are not snobs, but honestly it was a little weird. another concierge who helped us print our boarding passes completely screwed up our seat assignments so that we were not seated together. (we fixed this at the airport - but still? is this your first time printing a boarding pass??) and finally we arrived back one night from dinner at around midnight and told the concierge we would like a nightcap and asked where we should go. we were told the american bar was closed, and that the fancier bar was upscale and that we might not get in with what we were wearing. i was in a nice pants outfit and my husband was in jeans, but with nice shirt/shoes, etc. in their defense there were lots of people who looked like they had come from black tie events...but we paid $38 us dollars for our cocktails just like they did. the doormen at the bar seemed to have no issue with what we were wearing. left a bad taste in my mouth, again, from the concierge service. | the service did not ruin my stay. i would still recommend this hotel to people based on the location, the history and the nice decor. i just found it strange they way they talked to us. maybe it is because i am american?! who knows. | also - did not try the savoy grill but wish i had!'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i was looking forward to our stay in the rembrandt. my husband had told me in the train that he had booked a nice executive room. on the website they mention that these rooms were very spacious and clear, all pictures with two large windows, 25 square meter. | you can imagine our reaction when we were entering a room with only one window and a bed where i can put my feet on the wall by laying down, max 15 square meter. | we went to the reception and asked for another room and the receptionist declared that unfortanately this was an executive double room. i was annoyed because we were returning visitors and we have seen other and better rooms then this in the same hotel. we 've insisted and shown her the pictures. after that she was prepared to give us another room. we recieved a room on the third floor, which was better, but overlooking a building area with a lot of noice, starting 8am. | my husband and i have had a lovely week in london, but we will not choose this hotel anymore in the future, although the area is superb.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''a warm welcome from concierge, attentive service from the doormen who were friendly and very helpful throughout my 4 day stay.the cocktails and champagne were to die for and the beaufort bar was wonderful. | however, the bedroom had inadequate wardrobe space and no drawers. poor quality toilet paper, towels and robes, grouting between tiles needed a scrub! stale water left by my bed. no replacement toiletries. | i found the breakfast disappointing and although i received profuse apologies and complimentary champagne, the string in my chicken caesar salad was a tad off putting. | i booked a room for my brother as a birthday surprise, my name came up on his television screen! and they spelt his name wrong on a note they left him. call me picky if you like, but it is the attention to detail that let them down for me. i have been lucky enough to have stayed at several 5 star hotels over the past 12 months and the savoy sadly did not meet their standards.'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''location wise the hotel is situated around 10 minutes walking distance from the famous harrods shopping centre and knightsbridge. the single room was pretty compact and small but clean. nice and affordable hotel for short term business stays. friendly front desk staff. do not expect a five star ammenities though.''',1
Newham Hotel,"'''i booked this hotel before reading all the comments on tripadvisor. having read them i was a bit worried what kind it would turn out to be. i chose the hotel because of it is location, i had to go to somewhere 2 streets away. the hotel does have free parking, no mean feat in london. it is a 1920/30s built building most likely 2 or 3 houses joined up to make one property. i booked a single room with shared bathroom. the reception was pretty good, checking-in quick and with friendly staff, i did have to go back to get the electronic key to work but no big deal. the room was quite small, with a comfortable single bed, small chest of drawers and a wardrobe, the latter only having 3 coat hangers, none of which could be used for trousers. the room appeared to be generally clean, the heating worked perfectly. on the down side was the pigeon droppings on the window ledge (see photo). the hotel has seen better days and could use some refurbishing. my room was opposite the main romford road but is was not noisy at night i slept ok. the separate bathroom was pretty decent, clean, warm and of a good size. breakfast is pretty good, buffet style with bacon, eggs, sausages, mushrooms, baked beans and tomatoes, toast, jams &amp; marmalade and 2 types of breakfast cereals. a choice of tea or coffee, i tried both, pretty good. if you just want a budget priced room for 1 night this is not a bad place to choose, london hotels are very expensive but do not come here for your honeymoon, that is for sure. i would probably come back again.'''",1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''over priced boutique hotel with very small rooms, even for a petite person myself. the front desk, concierge and the porter were all very friendly and helpful but that was were it all stopped. once you got to the rooms you would find it difficult to fit in a suitcase because there was only enough room for the double size bed and due to the size there was no bar fridge as well. the bathroom was very awkward to use, because again it was very tiny in size and you felt like you were hanging out of it half the time. on an upside it was located approx. 15 minutes walking distance to good eateries, shopping and the famous harrods.'''",1
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,'''i know this hotel many years and no doubt is one of the most advanced in technology. | however this becomes sometimes an obstacle when often the key locks in the lifts and rooms do not work and you have to check with reception to sort out the problem. also the central ventilation has a problem because the hotel lobby and floor corridors smells like bbq tavern all the time and that is a huge contradiction with the hotel overall style and design. | another point that is worth noting is that the only hotel were english breakfast doesnot include items from the continental like basket of bakery fruit salad etc and only difference is just the egg selection with toast and coffee. for 32 ukp i think the fb manager got it all wrong. | on the other hand staff is generally polite and helpful and food although sometimes it takes ages is very good and tasty.''',1
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed 25th june for 2 nights. we stayed here earlier this year and enjoyed so much we tried again. how disappointed...we booked an executive king size and at best got an insuperior double. we complained and was then offered the room we booked. i had to take the booking form down to show the type of room we had booked. i must say the receptionist was quite abrupt. after an exhausting day we retired to the room and the aircon was not working. the room was really hot and opening the window did not help that much-mind you this particular weekend the weather was hot hot hot. the next day the engineers fixed the aircon (well we thought they did) and the following night was the same. the manager did get us a fan which helped. we did hear a couple of others complaining about the aircon also so it was not only our problem. the breakfast was suberb, great choice. will probably stay again, but, will not book less than an executive king sized (be warned!). hopefully this stay was a one off.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this was my 3rd or 4th stay! before this stay, i was hapy with the standards. i made my reservation through booking.com for an executive room. however the room was not in the executive floor. the front desk cleark told me the room type is executive room which was a very small &amp; old room. she did not changed the room since it was a booking.com reservation. normally it must be more important from the others. during check-out time in the morning, there were 2 people at the desk. one of them was trainee the other was careless and rude. check out took 30 minutes with the trainee. when i requested help from the other lady called ms.stephany, she did not even make an eye contact. i was about to miss my flight because of this. also service in the restaurant during breakfast was weaker than before. the best thing i experienced was location and cleanliness in the rooms! thank you to housekeeping team! | hotel should improve the front office standards as soon as possible!!'''",1

"Bulgari Hotel, London",'''we were very excited to be staying at the london bulgari hotel for a few nights business trip and had high expectations. sadly we were left a little dissappointed! the hotel itself and rooms are nice but not as new as the website would lead you to believe and the food/beverage offerings were in our opinion overpriced. upon arrivng at the hotel we were ushered to breakfast (that we later found out was not included in our board this certainly did not stop the wait staff encouraging us to order berries and yoghurt toast and all the trimmings from the somewhat confusing breakfast buffet table laid out in the dinning room - upon approaching the table we were told it was not self service and had to be served to us by the waiters - odd concept! overall the staff were nice but the place was over stuffy and over priced in respect to the offering ... it was nice but we will not revisit or suggest it to others.''',1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''while this hotels fulfills all one's expectations of a 5 star hotel in service and amenities, the room i was in felt small, dark and stuffy. maybe it was the fact that i was looking into a tight courtyard (as it can happen in london) or the choice of finishes and fabrics in the room (they were all on the darker side). not a place i necessarily wanted to come back to after a long day in the busy city. the park right behind it gives you an escape of the dark, but is that what you wish for when you pay for a first class experience? on a side note it was a bit strange that not one staff member was british, but they all spoke with a russian (or similar) accent. made me wonder if i really was in london. definetly no british experience.'''",1
London Guest House,"'''was not as easy access to wembley as i thought. need to take 2 buses which changed at not the best area to be in at 11pm with teenage girls x | the room was clean but bathroom was shabby and not as clean looking, breakfast not great scrambled eggs beans only hot stuff where cold, poor selection.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''the sleeping rooms are very nice, service is great, location is perfect for business travelers and tourists. i had a lot of business meetings in the promenade and it was a bit too frilly and old english - not very modern. but many people love that about the dorchester. the hotel restaurants are great and the event space on the first floor is excellent with an entrance right on the street level.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''yeah, if you need somewhere to stay that is bang near london wall, then this is the hotel for you. but for the money, this hotel did not overwhelm me. i worked nearby, finishing at 11pm, and the room service food choices were simply very poor. | the room size too, was only just big enough for 1. the bed took up most of the room. there is a desk (and free wifi which is always appreciated). but you literally have about 3ft wide of carpet left afterwards. | staff were friendly and helpful enough, although i did not stretch them really. | so go if you have to. but there are some better places nearby to be honest. the andaz for instance.'''",1
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''there were good things about this hotel and there were bad. | the good | great location for business | the staff was helpful | decent size rooms (for london) with modern bathrooms | very clean | the water was hot and plentiful | the bad | bad location for tourists only stay here if you are on business | the food was not great | no working a/c in my room (or any of my colleagues). this was particularly bad as i could not open my window because it was so loud. not sure why but it was like the street echoed noise. plus the curtains had to be kept tightly closed because of the really bright lights outside the window. | the hardest bed known to man | bad lighting - i have no idea what my make-up looked like when i walked out of the room | no near a tube stop | overall, i would probably not stay here again. not because it was so terrible but because i could not sleep while i was there do to the bed and the lack of a/c.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we reserved an executive double room. when we arrived, the first room we were placed in was very small compared to the photos on the website. we asked and were moved to another room. it did not look like the one on the website, either, but it was okay. during the night we were awakened by a loud pop and flash of blue flame. we had left my ipad plugged in to the european plug provided. it overheated and burned our charger and tripped the circuit breaker so we had no tv or ac until we called the next morning. we had concerns about the electricity for the rest of the stay and did not leave anything plugged in overnight or when we were out of the room. the bed was comfortable, the room quiet, and the shower had plenty of hot water. we had some trouble with our door locking and had to be certain to jiggle the handle to make sure the lock latched. we had a couple of experiences that made us feel less than satisfied. one is that we wanted to book a bus tour and the bus company advised to purchase the tickets through the hotel concierge. based on our research we chose one company, but the concierge told us the other company was much better and was cheaper. it was a bit less cost, but we counted how many of the ""other"" buses passed us each time we were waiting for our bus and it was always at least two or more. they advertised pickups every 10 to 20 minutes, but we waited up to 40 minutes. we had to take a taxi back from our last stop but we saw the ""other"" company's buses still running. it makes me suspect the hotel staff have a relationship with the bus company they sold us. also when we arrived we took 300 pounds sterling from the first atm we found at the airport. we took another 300 from the atm in the hotel lobby, which has signs that say ""free"". when we checked our bank the same 300 cost almost $50 more than at the airport and there were two atm fee charges for the one in the hotel, none at the airport. there were many other little things that did not ruin the trip, but just did not make us feel like our $250 per night was a great deal. we were offered a newspaper daily, but none ever came. i ordered a mocha in the bar and the staff member told me she had never made one before. it took her quite a long time, but she made something similar to a mocha. one day the bottled water in the room was re-stocked and one day it was not. we are going back to london next month and we are going to try to find some place better. breakfast was good. palette restaurant reviewed separately.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i stayed at the ridgemount for two nights in september. my room faced gower st., which is a thoroughfare with a moderate amount of traffic. i found it difficult to get a good night's rest due to the constant traffic and occasional rumbling from trucks on gower st. despite the room having dual windows. it sometimes felt like i was staying right next to a motorway. | the staff are personable and make you feel at home. a full english breakfast with toast and cereal is served. my room had an ensuite bathroom which was kept very clean. this hotel is a good value given its central london location. i highly recommend requesting a room facing the back of the hotel if you are a light sleeper like i am.'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed for a couple of nights one november weekend. i was really excited about experiencing this hotel. as a lover of design, it looked right up my street. the reception area, bars and restaurants are fantastically designed and are beautiful. the staff are also really friendly and helpful. the rooms are gorgeous and whilst a bit more information could be included about the design features, they are very comfy. | however, there some big points that let it down: | 1) service in the restaurant: very poor service was experienced here. the staff were slow and unresponsive to requests. we were not interested in having a breakfast buffet and ordered off the brunch menu. i ordered bacon and toast. 40 mins later, a plate of bacon arrived and i was told to make my own toast at the breakfast buffet. this is not 5 star service. i would recommend walking down the southbank for alternatives. the restaurant was not even busy. we did try it in the evening too and had a similar experience. it is a real shame as it is gorgeous and the food is okay. | 2) check out: i requested express check out as had to rush off at the end of my trip. i would recommend against using this service. they promise to email you an invoice of your charges. they have debited my card but 4 days later i am without invoice. | all in all a good experience, not excellent as expected.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed here with friends and were left with a slightly bitter aftertaste following poor communication. we had booked this through secret escapes and as a part of our deal we go a voucher we believed was for food and drink. despite checking multiple times as we ordered food and drink that what we had would be deducted, this proved not to be the case and unfortunately, we had money deducted from our account without warning a few weeks later for a supposed unsettled bill. despite the staff at checkout saying everything was settled. the whole situation probably came around from the very simple fact they did not have enough staff on in the bar the night we were there. one girl, it seemed, was having to serve all the tables as well as cope with a huge and noisy book event taking place. the hotel itself is good, a good location for the museums with access (with a cost) to a nextdoor spa and pool. it just was not as good as it should have been. breakfast was excellent but again not enough staff.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''i chose this hotel because i understood that there was internet access in the rooms. i use a tablet computer - and it needs wifi. the only part of the hotel with wifi access was in a drafty entrance - or in the bar. the room was stuffy, filled with an unnecessary amount of dusty textiles, and the bathroom was not spotless. the bed was soft, but the bedding was well out of date. does anybody really use sheets and blankets any more? breakfast was excellent, both choice and service.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''i agree it has the history and great location but i do not think the service no longer befits the definition of a luxury hotel. i woke up in the morning to find that there is no toothbrush and no toothpaste available in our room. for the amount that they charge you would think that they can afford a toothpaste right? i then called up room service to send me one, waited hour and no one showed up. now the worst part is that this place has i think most neglected security service. what i lost was an insignificant and perhaps a trivial stuff. oh well, so what someone else wanted it. not jewelry and not cash money. after checking out i called back the hotel to request them to look for the item i lost. i informed them that i either left it in the hotel room or someone just snatched it while it was under storage with concierge. the security personel promised to call me back. it is been two days now and i have not even received an apology call. it does not matter what i lost but it is lack of attention and negligence that really bothered me. for fellow travellers, not worth staying. the hotel has become somewhat lackluster in service and attention.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''well, when i check in at famous hotels i expect nothing but highest quality. the dorchester disapppointed me. maybe i was just unlucky, as other reviews are extatic. let us start with the beginning. i stayed in a deluxe room, which was spacious and nicely decorated. the view was to a nearby building but i did not care. the bathroom was lovely, with great toiletries from aromatherapy associates. soon after checking in, i wanted to have a shower when...guess what? a hotel male employee entered in my room carrying a luggage - of course he did not knock on the door... oh, i forgot to mention that i am a woman and lucklily, i was still dressed. following the hotel employee was a hotel guest, who was assigned the wrong room...my room! ten minutes after, i got a phone call from the reception: ""hello, are you mrs.x?"" ""yes. what happened?"" ""nothing, just checking."" no excuse was offered for employee's mistake! my colleagues who stayed in the same room category had fruit baskets in their rooms...not me. the breakfast was dissapointing: no buffet just a fixed menu - pastries, fruit salad, eggs (omlette). the waiter forgot to bring the bread at the table, the eggs were cold and only one pastry basket was served for two people. i also had lunches at the hotel, the food was good but not exceptional. overall it was ok but i expect more from the dorchester. i got better services in other london hotels so i will certainly stay somewhere else.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''maybe my expectations were set a little high as it was the savoy??? but to be honest a little disappointed. the room was very nice and well decorated and clean. however once we had been out for the evening, and we did go out quite early, i did expect the bathroom to be tidied up fresh towels etc. but this never happened. not something i am used to when staying in a hotel of this standard (and some much lesser ones!) petty in the grand scheme of things but did expect it. | still the best thing about this hotel is the arriving..they make you feel very special, and the american bar, the staff in there are amazing! even remembering us from a previous visit 2 months ago! | ate in the grill for sunday lunch which again was not great and i sent my lunch back, which we were not charged for, and they did make us a cocktail and take us into the kitchen to look round. maybe they were all having an off day? i have eaten here before and its been excellent. disappointed overall.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''in the last 18 years of intense travelling and criss crossing the globe, i have stayed many hotels. from the functional airport hotels to hotels in back and beyond to the ultra luxury ones. till date, 2 hotels have remained the yardstick as to what defines perfection in a hotel and they are the george v in paris and dorchester in london. for me, whether it was the four seasons in sydney or the fullerton bay in singapore or the hotel castillo son vida in palma, i have always compared each of them with the finest standards of the dorchie and georgie (my affectionate nicknames for both of them). today, i am afraid i have to drop dorchester from the elite list. i am currently staying at dorchie and writing this review is difficult because it always is tough when an icon falls from an exalted position. so the question is why? 2 main reasons. come back to the room at 4 am last nite and the flush of the bathroom does not work. ok, sometimes mishaps take place so called housekeeping at that hour ( being little buzzed so did not remember exact time) and they came and fixed the flush. it was a tad embarrassing to call house keeping in the early hours of the morning for that. the second thing happened today evening. we leave our room (129) at 8 pm sharp and we ensure there is no dnd sign. as we left in a hurry the room is in a slight mess but we fully expect the turndown service of the hotel to take care and ensure the room is ready for the night. we enter our room at 1.30 am and horror of horrors, there was no turndown service and the room was in the same mess we left it in. am i being too finicky? any other hotel i would forget about it but this is the dorchester we are talking about. the holy grail as to what perfection is all about in the hotel industry. is it slipping? is it going down the savoy route?? with a heavy heart, i remove dorchester from the best of the best hotels of the world list leaving king george v of paris on its own. sigh.......'''",1
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''our overall impression of the hotel, including decor and amenities, was good. dinner at massimo was acceptable except the dover sole which was priced at 42 but tasted stale and rubbery. had i been told that it was not fresh i would have chosen something else on the menu. | my main issue with the hotel was that, despite having paid my bill in full, they failed to cancel the 642 pre authorisation deposit as most major hotels would have done. when i complained, they added insult to injury by slapping on another 642 which decreased my available credit by a whopping 1284! almost a week later, this figure is still showing in my credit card account and, had i not been vigilant, could have caused me exceed my credit limit at great embarrassment. its extremely unfair that a top hotel should not cancel immediately the check in deposit when a bill has been settled in full. this whole incident has left me with a bitter taste.'''",1
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the location of this hotel is great. walking distance to hyde park and kensington gardens, close to the tube, and there is also a very close bus stop if you are planning on doing one of the hop-on/hop-off tours. the staff were also very friendly and helpful - one staff member even showed us where we could park our car and gave us a call in the morning to make sure we had moved it and would not get a fine. | we booked a triple room for our family, and the room was really big, having a double bed, a single bed, bed bunks and a small sofa with a pull out bed. the decor was fairly dated, but functional and the bathroom seemed quite new and modern (no bath). there were some negatives to our room - it was right below reception so we heard guests coming in and out, the breakfast room was also on our level so we heard everyone coming in and out for breakfast, and there was a rather bright orange glow from a building spotlight that shined right into our room all night. the lights also flickered and the tv did not work (but to be fair, we did not report this to staff). the continental breakfast is simple (as they tend to be), but it was fine. we ordered the scrambled eggs (not great) and the full english breakfast a couple of times (good) too. the staff were always very friendly (particularly in the breakfast area). free wi-fi also available. there is no elevator, which can be difficult with kids. but we were allowed to leave our pram at reception and our room was only down one set of stairs.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''the flower arrangements are so huge in the lobby that i worried about anyone having a severe allergy attack. the staff were all very helpful and polite. it seems from the cars parked in the driveway, the paparazzi sometimes at the front door and the body guards in the lobby, that this is a hotel that the very wealthy and famous stay at and so it felt a little intimidating to relax in the lobby or in the restaurants. our room was tiny (cramped) and felt very outdated. the room was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. i just felt that it is a hotel for those who want to feel like royalty (and maybe are?) but not for those who are (or want to feel) young, hip or current.'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''we and our friends had looked forward to our champagne afternoon tea for long time as it was our christmas gift from our good friends, who regularly stay at the dorchester for many years. having travelled 100 miles from hampshire, we arrived in good time, with high expectations of excellent service and quality. we sought help about parking and credit to the doorman on duty, we parked up nearby, we appreciated this. | we went and sat in the bar and ordered drinks. so far the service from the bar was good, very attentive staff. when our friends arrived we were then told our table was ready when we were ready to have our tea, no time given at this point. we went to the main dining hall, we sat down and were enjoying the sandwiches and had just been served the hot teas. shortly after we were told they needed the table so we had to vacate our table, and some of our cakes were packed up for us to take away but not the scones! we went and sat in the bar, leaving our hot drinks. we were told they would bring our drinks through but this did not happen and we did not ask again as felt we were in company of our friends. the sandwiches were of excellent quality and plentiful, we enjoyed these greatly. sadly our experience was spoilt by the table move! we just had to wait so long for everything, every time! | we were waiting to be joined by couple more of our friends, so we joined them for dinner. we decided to stay on at the bar, ordered more drinks. our host had booked a table for 6 people in the restaurant at 7.30, the service was so slow, menu choices was very limited, if you did not eat fish! we did not get our main courses until much after 9pm and i had ordered duck, which came out so dry, it could have flown off the table! i carried on did not want to send it back and wait again! i asked for extra sauce but they completely ignored and again did not make a fuss but our host did complain but i do not think it was taken off the bill! the staff did not seem at all interested in good service! i felt embarrassed at the poor standard and amount of veg was poor! no greens! we ordered souffls, for dessert they were excellent! by the time our meal finished it was nearly 11 pm and we left hotel at 11.30 to head home, exhausted! | would we come again? we certainly will not be rushing back especially when we know other smaller hotels do not fail to deliver exceptional service and quality food in london.'''",1

Rhodes Hotel,"'''on holiday from oz, we picked the rhodes because we could not find any complaints about it on this site!! the proprietors, chris and maria are very friendly, and nothing is too much trouble. the internet /computer setup outside the breakfast room was very convenient. there are no elevators, so bear that in mind, although cris was usually around to give a hand with luggage, up or down the stairs.. breakfast time was a hoot, plenty to eat, and again chris was often there having his coffee, with time to chat to everyone. the only let down was the room size, coupled with a power failure...which made for an uncomfortable night., ie, no fan or aircon, lights etc for the bathroom. we were switched to a family room for the next 2 nights...room to move, such bliss! the hotel is in an ideal location for just about anything you have in mind, and is a good spot as base camp. may see you again in 2011 chris and marie.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''careful of the 5% discretionary accommodations charge (they will neglect to tell you about it on check-in but will remove from your bill if you ask). | we checked in with 3 other couples at 1am after traveling all day to find that they had played the old hotel trick on us.....they upgraded us to an even better room because they were full. mind you, we had booked our rooms 3 months ago. they put us in the tower which is a beautiful stage set done by someone who never saw the room and who did not think people had clothing. we are here for a week. | between 1am and 2am i spent my time working with one of the porters removing tables from the room so we could get around without tripping over things. there is no place to leave an empty suitcase. they had to bring a hanging rack and put it in the bathroom so we could hang up our clothing. | breakfast in the room was fine but only 1 chair and the 2nd person had to sit on the sofa about a mile below the table.......of course, this will not be a problem tomorrow as they sent up a 2nd chair. | last week we had been at the royal gardens and loved the rooms.........we will be back there next time.......not here.............they do not play the 5% hide the fee game there (or any games at all). | by the way, part of the upgrade is a ""city view"" of the rather ugly rooftops of london as opposed to the view we would requested of hyde park. | spoke with the manager on duty and he was quite pleasant and fully aware of these problems........so why do not they fix them.......so why would they put a couple staying a week in such a room rather someone more appropriate to the facilities?'''",1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i stayed here after working a 14hr day so i did not get the chance to check out all the facilities on offer i.e. bars, restaurants and gym so can only give a limited review. | however if you are a guest just looking to put your head down after a long day then for the price this was a very expensive option (i booked last minute so this was all that was available in the area). i have heard mixed reviews myself on the hotel but the same one always comes through too expensive 260 for the room and 32 for room service breakfast?! a premier inn would have done the job just as well for my purpose. | as some other reviewers i would have expected a river view or that price not the building site that greeted me in the morning, though to the hotels credit i could not hear it even though it was literally across the road but i think they should have warned me of this considering the price i paid and/or offer those rooms at a discounted price, by the looks of it this work is at the beginning stages so they will have this problem for many months to come! | what i did like was a great selection from the mini bar, unlike most i actually love the location, on a quieter stretch of the south bank and as a commuter i genuinely advocate walking london where you can you get to see so much more than if you use public transport/cabs, and if you can afford to stay here as a visitor then i am guessing you can afford taxis out in the evenings! | room service breakfast is served on a lovely pull out table which i thought was a lovely touch rather than just having a tray dumped on your desk/table, made the dining much more enjoyable even though i was in my room! | as a personal assistant for a company across the river i will e contacting the manager for a more detailed show around the facilities before i consider booking this hotel again.'''",1
The Lanesborough,"'''i heard many great things about the lanesborough before its refurbishment. only to say i was greatly disappointed. | on arrival we where ignored by the doorman, who were busy chatting amongst themselves. | we checked in and the hotel was very pretty, the regency design was charming although the hotel furniture was so brand new it felt like we where in the disney version of the regency era. it also looked as though all of the fittings were brought in from a factory in china with that brand new smell. | as a florist i tend to notice the flowers, and the flowers look confused, the orchids in the bar for example are very modern for a regency style. but a few metres away there is an old fashioned english selection of roses, thistles and sedum. | the water in the orchid and chrysanthemum vase was yellow, to be fair it matched the dcor... unintentionally. | but the brassica in the main centrepiece was really quite dead! | on the plus side though, the staff in the bar where so attentive, and very good at upselling! | on departure though, doorman still paid us no attention. we think its because we did not have luggage, no luggage, no tip and therefore, no interest.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''my husband and i stayed here for one night after our wedding. the room was very basic and the decor was boring and bland. i was definitely expecting to be blown away as i have stayed in the sanderson before and thought that this would be on par. | the room was pretty small and the garden was like a concrete box. the bathroom just had a shower in it which i hate as i like to have a bath when i am travelling as its a bit of a luxury. | room service was slow and food arrived cold and undercooked. the breakfast did not get any better and it is definitely not cheap here. | when we left we asked for a cab to be called for us. they got us a black cab but we said we needed a normal one as we live quite far from the hotel. they said we should uber one as they did not have a local car company number which i found very rude and unhelpful. i do not have uber account set up so we ended up having to get a black cab which cost us 50 to get home rather than the usual 28 we normally pay. | overall not very impressed with this hotel and will not be returning in a hurry.''',1

The Savoy,"'''savoys name has always been associated with british conservatism, class and luxury; multimillion revamp has also been spoken about a lot. | my partner booked a lunch for us as a little treat, to which we both were looking forward to. | it was an absolutely gorgeous sunny sunday morning. after a glass of champagne on a boat taxi took us to savoy. a door man opened a door for us and showed us to the restaurant. we were greeted and taken to our table. a band was playing absolutely beautiful jazz. that is where, frankly, the luxury ended. while waiting for the menu, drinks, etc, i started watching people. one of the factors which makes establishments like savoy stand out, or visits more special than ordinary, is their dress code, which one would expect to be smart, at least smart-casual. however, some visitors were wearing jeans, t-shirts, which were more casual than smart. things like that do affect atmosphere, make it less special, makes one think: oh, well, next time passing by i might simply pop in for a bite if there is nothing better around. some do it any way, each to their own, but its not the reputation, which savoy had before. | when our starters came, mine happened to have a hair in it. when we pointed it out to the waiter, he came back with a hair from a pastry brush explaining to us that is where the unfortunate hair came from. although, the hair looked 100% human, we did not argue as the guy did make a huge effort to apologize. in general, service was good, but some waiters tend to be overly familiar, which again left some unpleasant aftertaste. they also seemed to be understaffed on that day as well, as it took ages to clear our table and we had to wait quite a while between the courses, especially for desserts. | in overall, the quality of food was ok, just ok, it was not particularly memorable. if it was not for the jazz and my company, it would have been just an ordinary sunday lunch like anywhere on a high street, which, i believe, by savoys standards is classed as hardly mediocre.'''",1
Ridgemount Hotel,'''the rooms were tiny very cramped. we were a family of 4 and it was way too tight. the bath room was also very very small-no space to keep soaps and other things. the room we stayed would have been ok for a couple. | the owners were nice and helpful. the break fast served was nothing fancy but adequate. central location. more suited for couples than for a family.''',1
The Savoy,"'''the hotel has a great location to visit anywhere in london. the positives are location, generally quiet, water in the room (no charge), restrained elegance, and excellent concierges. | negatives are the high price for an ordinary room, outrageously expensive food (breakfast), slow response to problems, lots of steps, superior attitude of the staff which may make some guests feel uncomfortable.'''",1

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we stayed in a river suite because we wanted use the living room for a private business meeting with two other colleagues. first we had a late breakfast meeting into a working lunch in northall. the food was great, the service was spotty. because we were working we did not mind so much but all of us noticed how long it took them to initially come over for orders. | when we reserved, we arranged for white boards, markers and afternoon tea to be brought to the suite at 4pm. we also asked for a gluten free tea service for me because of my celiac disease. at 1st they said they could not accomodate which we found odd and we commented that they should be able to provide service for guests with food allergies considering they are considered a 5-star hotel and they should really check with their manager or director of operations to find out for sure. they immediately confirmed they could conveniently. | when we went to the suite at 2pm after a very full and long working lunch, our tea service was already there. we rang to ask them to please take it back because we arranged it for 4pm and would like it fresh. | they seemed to not understand why we wanted it sent back. we had to reiterate we arranged for tea service to be delivered at tea time which we organised for 4pm, not 2pm and we would like the tea hot &amp; fresh. | they came and took it back...or so we thought! when 4:30 rolls around and no tea service we thought it was odd but gave them the benefit of the doubt that they were remaking everything fresh. | at 4:45 we rang and they told us they left the cart outside the door. we asked why they did not buzz because we had no idea it was there and they told us it was the cart from the previous service! | we were very surprised. after much to-ing &amp; fro-ing again, long story short, we had to ask them to come to the room to explicitly re-tell them to please remake the tea. we kept the cakes and fruit to keep it really simple for them. | they finally got it but sheesh! | other than that, we had a fine evening. we went down for few drinks in the glamourous northall bar which was very nice and low-key. | bed was comfy and the room was clean and nicely appointed with cool coffee table books for reading in our suite. | overall: the hotel is absolutely lovely. very chic yet grand feeling. maybe it was an off day (although it even started when we were reserving) but it is quite a pricey hotel and considers itself 5 star. for 5-star the service has to be impeccable. this was not our experience sadly.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i stayed at the mondrian london on friday the 9th and saturday the 10th of february. the check-in experience was good on friday afternoon and given we were staying in one of the cheaper rooms the room was a good size, extremely comfortable and had everything we needed. | on the saturday evening myself and my wife had booked dinner with six other friends (who were all staying in the hotel) in the sea containers restaurant. i am afraid to say the service from the start was appalling. we had to ask for water and after 40 minutes no one had been over to take our orders or explain the menu. for those who have not eaten there, the menu has a slightly strange layout which after some considerable persuasion was eventually explained. the concept is apparently tapas style with larger dishes designed to feed between two to three people. after about an hour we finally managed to order food. the wine service was equally slow, both to order and then to get glasses topped up. at one point, one of the party went to find the bottle of red wine to serve the table himself. the result was a wine waiter who then insisted on throwing wine into glasses, topping them up somewhere between half and three quarters full to presumably make some kind of ill-advised point. the food arrived (in several stages) and on the whole was very good, apart from a cured salmon dish. | at least three complaints were made during the night and the maitre d was spoken to on at least one occasion. whilst we were in no major rush, the feeling around the table was that without being constantly asked there would have been no service at all. despite this, when someone did eventually come to the table the service was some of the most surly i have experienced. | when the bill was asked for and eventually arrived it predictably had a 12.5% service charge attached! there was then a further wait and discussion around why the service charge should be taken off which it eventually was. having left the restaurant, my wife spoke to the hotels duty manager who although was apologetic seemed completely unable to really manage the situation. | what i should say at this point is that we made several visits to the dandelyan bar where the service was excellent and following our dinner went to the rumpus room where again the service was excellent, big thanks to julia our waitress. having listened to our experience in the restaurant the staff in the rumpus room gave us a bottle of champagne. whilst it was a terrific gesture, it seems odd that the staff in the rumpus room know how to manage an unhappy customer where the restaurant and hotel staff clearly do not. | on check out the following day nothing further was said about the complaint the night before. the systems were down so the hotel could not even tell me what i had been charged. despite insisting on a receipt and being assured one would be emailed, i am still waiting a week on. | whilst the hotel is very nice, my advise would be to have a drink in either of the bars but choose somewhere else to eat. there is plenty of choice.'''",1

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''it is a mandarin hotel, so i will not go into the positives- they should be self evident for a hotel of this group, in this location and at these prices. staff were very nice and this in some ways made up for a general failing on many points: | 1. overpriced everything- rooms, food, drinks etc etc | 2. room service after hours was horrible. the food was practically inedible and given the location of the hotel- bordering hyde park in expensive knightsbridge- there were no other options to eat late night. when we complained (particularly annoyed as we had ordered asian food options and it is an oriental hotel!) they did remove the food and an asian cook who admitted the food was terrible offered to personally prepare some fried noodles for us. no complaints on this replacement food | 3. no iron and ironing board in the room- do not usually mind having to request from housekeeping but do not expect this from such an expensive hotel | 4. pushy bell boy who followed us out the door asking if we wanted this that or the other, obviously angling for a tip. then when my husband offered a note to the young guys who actually had helped us with the luggage, he snatched this from my husband and promised to split it between them. i would not hold my breath...'''",1

The Savoy,"'''first impressions were actually quite good, the hotel seemed fresh and modern without losing the classic characteristics that made the savoy such an iconic hotel in the past. | indeed, whilst there were plenty of other faults, athescetically the savoy is a solid attempt at an update, and although the savoy grill does seem a bit dark and outdated, it is a hark back to the art deco form that was frequented by so many big show biz names (whose black and white pictures adorn the walls). last time i ate in the restaurant it was being run by gordon ramsey and like his fortunes, the food has sadly stagnated, and the prices will make many discerning diners feel shortchanged. more could have been done here and to seriously compete with the other top hotels in london they need to attract a high profile chef to install his own vision. | like the hotel refit, it is a decent enough attempt, but the end product and atmosphere have failed to build on the magic and essence of what was there before. it feels sterilised, standardised; dare i say it american. the new owners, the fairmont group of hotels, have missed a trick with the savoy and the overwhelming reason for the that was the service. | i like to think i am reasonably well travelled, and have stayed at some top hotels - some big, some small, some expensive, some excellent value for money. everytime i have ever left a hotel with a grin of satisfaction, it has been due to the service, which for me, is the number one concern when staying in a hotel. i have also worked for a short time in a hotel renowned for its service excellence, so i think i am well placed to offer my opinion on the service at the savoy, whichis, by all intents and pursposes, atrocious. | from the cold and aloof welcome, to the almost sarcastic comments made when questions are asked, the hotel has seriously failed at consolidating a level of service that is anywhere near the other top hotels in london that charge these prices. the service was so bad that it actually made the stay unpleasant; on the sunday morning we could not get a table for breakfast, even though we had reserved one and advised the hotel a member of the party had to depart promptly for a flight from heathrow in advance; the staff could not have cared less, and made little effort to address the problem; cue an awkward 45 minute wait standing in the middle of the foyet for a table, with no communication from staff as to what exactly was being done to alleviate the situation. | whenever one rang a department from the room (i.e housekeeping) the phone rang endlessly before someone answered in a tone that inferred you had rudely interrupted them; this simply would not and should not happen at a 5 star hotel, anywhere. it is as if the staff were instructed to go out of thier way to make you feel uncomfortable. golden rule of any business? put the customer first- at this rate, they will not have any left. | avoid the savoy for now. | it may be that with time it will improve (it has only been open since the refit for a few months), and for the sake of the hotel and its legacy i hope it does. but for now, best avoided unless you actively enjoy rude staff and being made to feel like you are unwelcome, and then paying through the nose for the privalege.'''",1
The Savoy,'''despite the lavish refurbishment of the public rooms and good service we would not stay there again as the bedroom was a big disappointment. the renovation of the bedroom we stayed in was very superficial. the bed was hard and lumpy and led to a sleepless night for myself and back ache for my husband. they obviously had not replaced the mattress during the recent refurbishment. in addition the duvet cover was torn in the middle and they supplied a top sheet to save themselves from washing the duvet cover. i always think this is less hygenic as invariably the sheet does not cover the whole duvet. in the bathroom the sealant around the bath was old and the tiles a bit shabby although the shower looked new. the bathroom was cold so i am not sure if there was any heating in there. there was a large flat screen tv in the room but when we tried to watch it the sound was out of line with the picture. we had a swim in the pool which was warm and the area around the pool was nicely laid out. the service generally in the hotel was good but they said we would have a long wait for food when we wanted a light meal after returning from the theatre that night. we decide to have room service instead and the meal came reasonably promptly.''',1

The Savoy,"'''an army of staff greet you sequentially upon arrival. the check in is done by 3 people in orchestration after which you are submitted to a detailed tour of your room down to the last detail (slippers etc). all in all, you need 20 minutes from arrival to find yourself alone in your room. everything is very formal and pompous,including the luggage porter walking backwards in respect when leaving your room. when it comes to important things, however, like room service, breakfast restaurant service or reception help, their quality is really very inadequate. at reception, one member can issue multi room cards, the other one insists this is not feasible. at in room dining , after ordering 2 main courses, one fruit salad and some sugar, a waiter appeared half an hour later with only the fruit salad. he said they did not send him an order with the rest of the things. when everything else came the sugar still did not. nowater or bread with the order. at breakfast the next day, again a choreography of 4 waiters, one for the seating, one for the orders one for the beverage serving and one for bringing the food from the kitchen. still my omelette came with the bread and my fork missing! i hope the savoy and fairmont do better soon'''",1
The Rembrandt,'''i stayed here for one night recently and have to admit i am kind of ambivalent about the place. the lady who checked me in was unfriendly to an extreme and no-one offered to bring my suitcase to my room even though i was travelling alone. the service at breakfast was so so; i had to ask one of the many servers who kept walking past my table to bring some coffee. i asked for a taxi when i was checking out but the person on the desk mumbled something about turning the light on. i did not quite catch it and he did not make an effort to ensure i understood so i waited at the front door until a taxi arrived. | maybe my expectations were quite high because if i stay in a 4* hotel in knightsbridge then i expect a certain level of service especially if i pay knightsbridge prices. it just did not seem like a 4* hotel. | on the plus side the room was nice and fully equipped. the bathroom had a robe and slippers which is a nice touch. the selection at the buffet breakfast was vast and it would be very possible to eat enough to keep you going for the day. | would i stay here again? probably not.''',1
The Savoy,"'''we went for a celebration event, for dinner and an overnight stay. | the hotel itself is great: lovely decor, good doorman, lovely room and very good detail. top draw. however: | we wanted a cup of tea (at teatime), but it could not be done without enormous kerfuffle. staff could understand we did not want the whole cream tea thing (which was fully booked anyway) and to sit in the bar required a ""managers authority"". 25 minutes to sort. | kaspar's restaurant started well, although producing a menu with basic spelling mistakes takes some doing. never had a smocked mackerel before.... then to be told that there was no turbot, and that they had no dover sole either, left a much diminished menu when it came to fish. how can the savoy run out of fish ? food was good, but only the ox cheek was exceptional-and it really was exceptionally good. | after dinner, a request for a glass of madeira met with a ""no"". how can the savoy, which proudly told us had the best bar in london, not have madeira ? | good breakfast, although to be asked by every single member of staff ""how are you today ?"" was a bit repetitive. they should let staff loosen up a bit, as it felt a bit over trained. | so, lovely stay, but food and service not at the standard i had expected.'''",1

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we stayed for a night in a room on the 4th floor. the service was amazing and the staff were extremely nice, friendly, helpful, and well-trained. i had read the reviews and i knew the rooms were small but i was quite surprised to see how tiny our room was. we stayed as a couple but i think the room was more suitable for one adult. there is everything you need in the room but due to the lack of space it is impossible to enjoy the facilities to the fullest. for instance, i really loved to have a cuppa in the room but it was absolutely impossible to make one given the tiny room and one tiny chair. also, when we wanted to get dressed to go out we were literally bumping to each other so we had to get ready one at a time (which was quite funny!). i do not think it is possible to stay in this room for more than a night. i was horrified when i saw the size of the bed and i thought most probably i would end up on the floor in the middle of the night but that was not the problem. unfortunately, my pillows were extremely uncomfortable. the road outside started to get busy from 3:00 am so unfortunately i had a really bad night sleep. the breakfast was quite average. although i really enjoyed the way the staff treated the guests and the location is really convenient, i would not book it here again due to the size issue.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''we had stayed at the savoy for around 5 days over new year's. great location to see the fire works without having to venture into the largely drunken crowds. the doormen were really great; they were wonderfully welcoming and great when we brought my great aunt, who is 84 years old, for afternoon tea. but for the most part, with the exception of two polish butlers (one blonde girl we had when we first arrived and a light brown haired guy) and the girls in the american bar and the tea shop, service was snotty at best. when i go on vacation, i do not want to have to dress up, but a good number of the workers there seemed to think that meant they could act as if they were superior to me. we had a junior suite and were supposed to have a twin bed made available, which did not occur. we had been told that the hotel had rented them out for the time, so if the booking people try to say that the savoy does not do cots, it is not true. they eventually gave us the family suite, which had a horrible view of the center court of the hotel, but at least had sufficient beds as we had booked. the beds were good, but supposively the queen bed has a hard spot straight down the center (because of split box springs?). in any event, would only stay here again for new year's. the location is worth it, but the suite is not. oh, and as a side note, be careful when ordering coffee or water; coffee is charged by the cup and water is apparently mineral, so is around 4 to 5, and gratuity of 12.5% is added onto all food and drinks, regardless of poor service or not. and if they say free english breakfast (ie. our fairmont member offer), only covers 30 out of 32. and do not stay here if you cannot climb a fair amount of stairs. tons everywhere and no ramps.'''",1
The Dorchester,"'''wow, i have never stayed at the dorchester group hotels, but have, of course, visited many times, the various locations-the bel air, 45 park lane, and the grande dame, the dorchester! i cannot tell you how disappointed i am with the rooms-everything is so old, i am not sure my grand-mother would have liked it here! | the rooms need a complete redo and overhaul-everything is old and not charming. i have received very mediocre service, so far-i am very unimpressed! the public areas are beautiful-bar, restaurant, lobby, hallways. but once you get inside a room, it is kind of a dump! i am very disappointed with the quality of the rooms at this hotel. that is why i say-do not bother to stay; just visit!'''",1

The Dorchester,"'''my expectations towards this top-class, fast legendary hotel were high. on the whole, this hotel fulfilled most of my expectations, living up to its five-star category. however, the devil is in the details, details that may betray a few weaknesses in management. | the overall setup of the lobbies and the room was awkward, with little mapping and pointers towards the different ground floor rooms. an excessive use of mirrors, as well as doors hidden behind folding screens, make it confusing. staff are not informed about which room hosts which conference, which does not simplify this apparently trivial matter. let us add some tea room doubling up as a lobby (and as a prayer room as well when i went through it apparently at the wrong time!) and the piano playing the wrong kind of music at the wrong time (satie's gymnopedies when a room needed not to be quieted and reassured but excited). | food-wise, a few items fell short of expectation: croissants and other breakfast pastries were less fresh than expected, and a few deserts bland if not tasteless. sugar lumps for coffee, for a standing room, came up wrapped up individually: unnecessary and needlessly awkward, when a sugar pinch would have done the trick. but we get drawn down into tiny details. | some heavier question marks arose when seeing staff at work: none of them wearing any badge, none of them boasting some form of joy of working, and a lot of people standing idle at the wrong place wearing the wrong face, namely that of the supervisor with nothing to supervise. smiles, hard to come by, were strictly professional. i noticed some failures of teamwork as well. | apart from these warning signs, shall we repeat the countless songs of praise, which mention the beauty of the building, the incomparable location in park lane (monopoly players would have noticed, the most expensive place on the board), etc.'''",1

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we stayed in a family room (room 31) on the top floor ... 59 steps up. we carried our heavy bags up and down and walked the stairs several times a day between trips around london. this would not have been an issue had we not been at the end of our holiday with all our bags with us. | this place is more like a guest house - clean and tidy - rather than a hotel. | the family room was on the small side for us, especially with little room to put suitcases. the room had two single beds and a double, though the wife thinks that it could have been a king single. the room has an ensuite with shower and toilet. | one thing to note is that the uch (hospital) is just up the road. the number of sirens (ambulance &amp; police) that we heard each evening was an unwelcome reminder of life in the city centre. closing the windows and secondary double glazing helped a little but the room could get a little stuffy with four people in it. | i found the room warm in late afternoon and we had to open the windows to get any relief. it soon cooled and it was mostly comfortable during the evening. | the proprietor and staff were welcoming and provided good advice on special events occurring in london. | breakfast was interesting. a choice of four cereals followed by a mini cooked breakfast of eggs + bacon and one other from an apparent rotating schedule of other foods (tomatoes, sausage or beans). as much toast as you could eat and tea / coffee / hot chocolate / orange juice. | there was a lounge with coffee machine, tv and two computers with internet connectivity. we did not use this facility. | we have stayed in better places in london but they were more expensive. we chose this place for its location within central london and the transport links here are excellent. the price of the accommodation is fair given the location. the accommodation is clean and tidy and the staff were very good. i would recommend it but do not expect a palace.'''",1
The Rembrandt,"'''this is a nice hotel but you can tell it is at the time that it needs some tlc. there is nothing special about the service. it was not bad but not great. the room is a decent size with a good size bathroom. the bed was uncomfortable because you can feel the springs in the mattress and it gave me a little backache. we hung out at the bar in the evenings for a nightcap and the bartender was top notch. however, the overall staff of the restaurant was not very welcoming and kind of seemed bothered to help us. also they do not have warm food (at the restaurant or room service) after 11pm which sucks when you have that late night craving. | the location is excellent if you plan to visit the museums as they are very close. besides that, there is not much to do in the immediate vicinity and the area lacks restaurants and pubs. but like i said, for the museums, you cannot get a better location. overall, this hotel is a 3 1/2 star in my opinion. | it could be a 4 star with some updates and friendlier staff. i would prefer to not stay there again, but if was only i option, i would not be too unhappy. not my first choice though for future visits. | also be careful on the free breakfast, some rates do not include is and some do. we got the free breakfast but my sister's room did not. nothing spectacular about the breakfast though.'''",1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i know they are renovating the rooms but they are not available yet. the room was a king room overlooking hyde park. a lot more expensive than similar 5 star hotels. | the room was very tired, looking shabby round the edges, scratches, marks, spy hole spins, pictures on the wall not straight - fixed slightly off so one cannot correct etc. | we had an okay stay but if you are looking for top end luxury this is not the place. | some of the detail that they messed up on... | asked by phone before we got there if there was anything we would like, i requested tea making facilities in the room and the bed made with sheets and a blanket instead of a duvet. neither was done. we requested again the bed making and this was done at turn down. unfortunately the blanket was not big enough and we wrestled for it over night. the next day the bed was made with the blanket the wrong way round so that it did not even reach the sides of the bed! we thought about turning it but instead deciding to leave early not staying the other night. the tea making turned up a day late. we ordered a cooked breakfast in our room, it arrived but we only had one chair in the room. the delivery man asked if we would like another chair, i accepted only to be told it would take 10-15 minutes. not much use with our breakfast getting cold. so i sat on the bed to eat. the tv was okay for an hour or so then every 3 to 4 minutes, crackled and messed the picture up for 5 seconds. annoying but not bad enough to request a replacement tv! the room had a balcony but was a bit dirty and rough, i guess it is not used much. the room only came with one robe when there two of us. there was no complimentary water in the room. so we had some from the mini bar. | the good things were... free gifts of a chocolate easter egg as we were staying over easter i guess. the concierge responded brilliantly to my enquiry about the availability of the new renovated rooms (some ready in the summer). he showed us personally an example suite on the 3rd floor. they look very smart. the staff were friendly and responsive. although being asked if we were enjoying london encouraging us into conversation by every staff got a bit tiring after a while. | on check out the lady asked about our stay. i told her and she was sorry that we did not have the best of stays. they added a voluntary service charge of 5% on the cost of the room. in the circumstances i asked for it to be removed which she duly did and agreed. she asked if they could do anything, i suggested the manager may email me to explain / apologise maybe. she said she would pass it on. no one came back to me. | the main entrance is presently closed, so the entrance is presently on the side. going through a few corridors to get to the main reception. this in itself is no problem, however their is no signage to help you leave which was a bit confusing. we saw another party wondering the halls trying to leave as well. a couple of signs would solve that problem. | all in all we did have a reasonable stay with no major problems. it is just when you pay that much, i would have not expected those issues. | there are better luxury hotels in the area (park lane for instance) at a lower cost which we will use in the future.'''",1

The Savoy,"'''we stayed here in october 2015 for a trip to the theatre. the accomodation was lovely as you would expect, the staff were professional, helpful and welcoming. the only fly in the ointment was the breakfast the next day at kaspars. | we ordered a savoy breakfast and eggs florentine. unfortunately, they did not bother putting the bacon on (the plate was almost empty without the bacon, so how that was missed i have no idea), the sausage was dry as a bone. after querying it, they asked what sort of bacon i would like, smoked or streaky. after asking for smoked they brought me cremated, inedible streaky bacon after finishing the rest of the meal. baffling. no apology, no explanation, nothing. | the eggs florentine were apparently ok. the rest of the breakfast (coffee, pastries, etc) was pretty average.'''",1
The Savoy,"'''the location of the hotel is fabulous. however at 500 a night i was not impressed at finding hairs in the bath. had the bath been cleaned? i called 'house keeping' who sent someone to the room fairly quickly and the hairs were cleaned away but this was such a disappointment. the room was adequate but nothing special. the air conditioning was difficult to manage as the room was either too hot or too cold. the bed was quite high off the ground. i thought i was going to get a good nights sleep but i was kept awake because the slightest little twitch from my partner made the whole bed reverberate. the american bar was ok but nothing special. one of the cocktails was listed at 5,000. this in my opinion is insane. i wonder how many of these cocktails they actually sell. quite possibly the world has gone mad, the savoy now has a boodles concession which i had a little foray into. there was a lovely assistant in there (efa) who was very pleasant. if i did happen to have a spare 5,000 burning a hole in my pocket i would prefer to spend it in boodles rather than on a drink. roll on a lottery win.'''",1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''having stayed at several morgans hotels on both sides of the pond, i was really looking forward to checking in to the mondrian london. | i have to say i was bitterly disappointed and left questioning whether this hotel was actually a morgans property. | normally the second you step into any morgans property, you instantly know you are in a morgans hotel. they always have the wow factor &amp; the dcor has such a quirky, distinctive style, and the service is always exemplary without being stuffy. the same cannot be said about mondrian london- we could have been in any generic high-end hotel in the world, and some of the staff behaviour we witnessed was highly sub-standard. | the room was nice, but nice is not a word i would normally use to describe a morgans room- its usually amazing, iconic, incredible. it was stylish but had no soul &amp; dcor wise we could have been in a room in any hotel in the world. however the view of the thames &amp; st pauls was fantastic and was a redemptive feature &amp; the large marble bathroom, which is synonymous with morgans was amazing &amp; without doubt the highlight of the room. | the bed was enormous, but was so hard it was like sleeping on breeze blocks- possibly one of the worst nights sleep i have ever had- had to get up in the night &amp; go &amp; sleep on the couch- not really what you expect from a 500 room. | we had aperitifs in the dandelyan bar- again the dcor is completely unremarkable- nothing special when compared to the likes of the groups other bars, but was comfortable enough. we had really high hopes for this bar, as it is apparently run by an award winning mixologist, so we could not wait to sample to cocktails- and wait we did- while we pored over the enormous, incomprehensible menu. it was more like a botanical reference book than a cocktail menu- gargantuan in size and too wordy with no comprehensible flow. people know what they like to drink- either in terms of the spirit base of their cocktail (vodka, rum, gin, whiskey), or the type of drink they prefer (martini, flute, long etc..), therefore it is a sensible idea to arrange menus in a way that people can easily access the information they are looking for, as most high end places do. we got so fed up of trying to look for something suitable that we gave up &amp; ordered a glass of champagne- which was served warm &amp; flat!!!! quite ironic that these supposed award winning bartenders, were not even able to get a glass of champagne right! but the waitress- not sure of her name, but she was of an eastern heritage- was very welcoming and friendly with a constant smile, so made up for the poor drinks. | we went through to dinner, and it was fantastic, the food was all executed perfectly &amp; really tasty &amp; well presented. service was also very good, but we found the waiter to be quite formal and stiff which was quite surprising in a morgans. he was very efficient and slick, but was not very engaging and definitely needed to smile more. the dcor of the restaurant was very elegant and had great views across the thames. there was a clear managerial presence on the floor, which always instils confidence in you as a diner. the irish manager checked on our table, and the other tables around us, a touch that was very much appreciated. breakfast was also excellent there. i would wholeheartedly recommend the sea containers restaurant, as a stand-alone venue. | we had drinks up at the rumpus room &amp; were welcomed by a very colourful character who instantly put a smile on our faces &amp; gave us a very warm welcome (not sure if he was the manager or host- gentleman with a beard &amp; earrings). again the bar was nice dcor wise, it had a classy feel to it &amp; the views across the thames were spectacular. this time we opted to sit at the bar, so we could speak to the bartenders about the drinks &amp; avoid another negative experience like we had in dandelyan. we were served by great bartender- cannot recall his name- blue eyed chap who i believe told us he was from hungary. he was friendly &amp; chatty &amp; made us feel welcome without being intrusive. he made us some bespoke cocktails based on our preferences, which were exquisite. faith restored, we opted to order the next round from the menu- big mistake- they pre make their cocktails in batches &amp; literally just pour it out of a bottle onto ice!!! you may expect this kind of cutting corners from a high-volume, low-end venue, but we certainly did not expect this from a supposed high-end cocktail bar in a luxury hotel!!!! when you are paying around 15 for a cocktail, plus service charge, you expect your drinks to be freshly made &amp; for there to be a bit more service than simply opening a bottle! i could not believe what i was seeing! the bartender made us some more bespoke cocktails instead, which again were great- if you visit this bar ask for the bartenders to make you something based on your likes &amp; avoid their menu. we moved to a table &amp; had several different waitresses check on us &amp; serve us, all of whom were friendly &amp; attentive. | the ambience was good in the bar &amp; it is great for people watching, but one thing we did notice, which we thought was highly inappropriate was the lady with the short hair &amp; american accent -not sure what her role was but she seemed to work there, as went behind the bar &amp; was talking (well shouting across the room actually) to all the other staff- openly imbibing in the bar! in our experience of high end hotels, the staff do not normally openly drink to the point of belligerence in front of the guests during hours of service, so we were quite shocked by this &amp; did not think having a drunk member of staff on the floor was acceptable. so this &amp; the pre made cocktails let this bar down &amp; clouded our otherwise good experience. | overall i would say this hotel &amp; its facilities are mediocre at best. they are ok, but when you are paying five star prices, you expect a five star experience. if you are a morgans aficionado like me, then avoid this place and stay at sanderson or st martins lane instead, where you will receive the full morgans experience. | but i would certainly recommend the sea containers restaurant, excellent food &amp; good service in a beautiful location. | and if you do not mind a drunken member of staff shouting across the room &amp; having to sit at the bar to order with the bartenders, then i would also recommend rumpus room.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''it was a special day out for my elderly mothers birthday which started off nicely . the staff were delightful but the tea experience was not. it started off ok with lovely sandwiches then went downhill very fast. after we had eaten the sandwiches and scone we were ignored for about 30 minutes - we looked around the room and nobody had been offered a pastry and our waiter was nowhere to be seen. eventually a tray of pastries arrived and we felt we should only choose 1 or maybe 2 in the hope the tray would return shortly to offer you some more but sadly that did not happen. after another 20-30 mins we were asked if we were ready for a piece of cake. unfortunately it was just too late and the moment had past as after an hour and 45 we had waited around for too long. i asked for the cake to be boxed to take home only to be told they have changed the policy and you cannot take anything with you. i have to say i was shocked - as we regularly visit hotels in london who kindly box some pastries for you to take home which is part of the tea experience. so for 50 plus service we had sandwiches , a scone and a pastry which frankly is appalling ! i was so upset that i called the manager who apologised but it was too late and my mothers birthday treat was ruined !'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the location of this hotel is good as this is near to the paddington station and hyde park. i read there are a lot of peoples saying that the staff is friendly and this is true but not the landlord of the hotel. we find and observed he is friendly and talkative to the western people but not to the other countries of peoples. he even does not say goodbye to us when we leave the hotel when we said to him. this hotel do not free offer the traditional full english breakfast as the normal b&amp;b will do but you can pay 6 pounds to buy the full breakfast which you could easily find the same price but better quality of food in nearby bar or cafe. the fried eggs is free of charge but you have to ask and they do not tell you if you do not ask. this hotel is fourth floor height and do not stay in the higher floor as you are surprising find the water pressure is terrible weak and even no single drop of cold water come out from the tap in the peak hour so you have to wait until the off peak hour before using the shower. my advice is to test the water before you put your shower cream on otherwise you have really big trouble. the toilet is newly refruished but the carpet in the room is old and dirty which is highly contradict to the toilet. well, this is our true experience i share it here for the reference and your experience may be totally different to us. by the way, we find somebody smelly sock left on the side of the bed which do not know how long has been left there.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''not great. dirty, poorly maintained, and judging by the breakfast some of the staff members blatantly do not care about looking after guests (mass-cooked fried eggs just left to sit for hours). one night receptionist (tariq) was very helpful, though. fine for a quick budget stay if you need to, but otherwise best avoided.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''caution - our room was musty, shabby, and hot - certainly not ""four star"" quality. service was fine, but not exceptional. perhaps you need the ""upgrade"" in order to get the quality that everyone else is talking about in their reviews. the location was very convenient.

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''very disappointed in the room (executive room, streetview) - which was small in size and cleanliness can be improved. room decor is a little old. different from photo shown on website ( missing fireplace, and mirror/clock on wall ) pricey and i get a far better suite at rosewood with lower price yet excellent service overthere.'''",0
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''stopped in here a few times, only just found out that each time i have been going to the bar myself and carried my own drinks back to the table i have been charged 12.5% for the privilege!! how can this be justified? i think it is pretty terrible and is a worrying trend to rip people off!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''if you love having aggressive maids enter your room when you have requested not to, then this is the hotel for you. | if you love terrible breakfast that is not worth getting up for, then this is the hotel for you. | if you love hearing the arguments &amp; door slams down the hall way from your fellow neighbors, then this is the hotel for you. | the hotel itself has a great location, the rooms are fairly spacious (tiny bathroom with mold growing on the ceiling), &amp; the elevators work. | the hotel staff do not seem that interested in actually helping. there are a set of annoying stairs out the front, with no luggage access. no one tries to help you up those stairs, &amp; they really are not approachable, so my stay felt very uncomfortable. | the room service staff cannot understand what you are ordering down the phone. | the thing that turned me off the most about this hotel was the aggressive maid service. they ignore do not disturb tags. they are knocking outside rooms from 8:15am. they call your room several times throughout the day to ask repeatedly if you need the room cleaned when you have requested not to. i left the door chained my entire stay, scared one might walk in on me in the shower. | this hotel really had potential to be so much better, but it turned out to be quite an unpleasant stay. i would not recommend it for what you are paying for unless you really cannot find a better option.'''",0
London Guest House,'''everything was fine with the booking until our work men arrived and they had a double bed and a single bed in a triple room when we requested 3 single beds and the person i had made the booking with confirmed this with me on the phone. the manager then rang and was very polite and said he would see what he could do to sort this mistake. after speaking to the manager i then received a phone call from the member of staff i originally completed the booking with and he was very rude on the phone and started to argue with me saying i had not requested 3 single beds when i had. i found that the way they dealt with the situation was very unprofessional. would not recommend.''',0
Newham Hotel,"'''overall the room was acceptable, very basic but clean, however there was no heating the windows were very draughty. we asked for a plug in heater but they had none left as other rooms needed them. i was given their email address and phone number by the pleasant receptionist when i left but they refuse to speak or reply to any emails.'''",0
The Savoy,'''my wife and i had a reservation for the savoy grill but had an hour to fill prior to sitting down for lunch. we decided on a coffee and approached the cafe manager for a table to be told that she was very sorry but they needed all the tables because they were to start afternoon teas service in 15 minutes. there were no patrons in the cafe at the time. quite extraordinary. sometimes i think the superior attitude of some staff at prestigious establishments needs to be adjusted. it was far more important for the manager to have a precise change over in service than to be of service to a customer. oh well. the grill was good!''',0
A To Z Hotel,'''this hotel is not at all good value for money. it is very filthy and unhygienic. there was no working tv as advertised and the noise level is too high for someone to get some rest. the bed sheets are not that clean. i will never recommend this hotel again for the money paid.''',0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''london is very expensive. considering the location the price for the hotel is alright. nevertheless the rooms were very small, very average. do not expect anything. the location is noisy, there is not even shower gel in the showers. the breakfast was the worst we had in the 3 weeks trip and there was no alternative to choose from. the managers are trying to help with every request regarding sightseeing and such but it does not compensate for the lack of almost everything.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''my first - and definitely last - stay at the savoy. i understand that the hotel was completely overhauled in 2010 - and hats off to them for that; an accomplishment no doubt. however, i was simply not impressed - not even slightly. the rooms were so-so, the gym average and the (overpriced) food nothing to write home about. but that is ok i am a seasoned traveler and can deal with that. however, i think the thing that put me off was the staff located in the lobby. every one of them seemed distant, cold, and detached - not very friendly and seldom smiled they were very zombie like. although, truth be told, the doorman out front who hailed the cab for me each morning was awesome! full of character and bounce - he always greeted me with a big warm smile, made it a point to chat with me while i waited for the cab, and then wished me a good day. this totally made for a great start to the day; i actually looked forward to my cab ride each day, but dreaded having to walk across the lobby in order to get to the front door. =( for the record, if i could have commando rolled from the lift to the front door i would have gladly done so in order not to have to endure the condescending sneers of the staff in the lobby. heck, i routinely walked right past one of the female greeters two days in a row and not once did she ever smile and say good morning to me - not once. i understand the savoy history and what not, and it is indeed conveniently located in the theater district, but the lobby staff - put quite bluntly - flat out sucked. i will never stay here again unless by accident - or forced to. actually, in hindsight, the holiday inn express at the airport probably would have been a better and friendlier choice.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''pre the rebuild it was possibly the best hotel in london then it was sold with the change in management so the affability and warmth evaporated. now its brash, in your face and the expected subtleties previously attributed to it are long gone. | nothing appeals and its a place you may go to the once now but see no reason to return. its turned into a trashy russo-arab glitzy and not worth the cost of the evening. in short they have successfully killed a once great hotel'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed here in the idea of being close to the shops and museums etc. | me and my partner wanted a little luxury &amp; found this hotel on offer. | we made our way to our room &amp; opened up, i was really annoyed as the size was very small. i am not the sort that gets annoyed with the size but we could have stayed in our usual hotel for a cheaper price. i made a complaint but this did not go any further.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we were 40 mins late checking in i had given myself an hour to propose to my fiancee and then had an appointment with a jeweller, this appointment got halved due to the delay. this might not seen much but if you pay these kind of prices you do not expect any hassel. | also the butler said my clothes would be pressed within 15-20mins and it took twice as long, which made me rush to get ready to go out. the room and hotel was beautiful, but my expectations of them were higher.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''the other reviews do not exaggerate. when i got there a man was arguing loudly with the man in the lobby. he was trying to leave before his reservation ended, and get some of his money back. i should have taken this as a cue to leave. the location is lousy, my room had a stench that was a mixture of bugs and smoke (even though it was a non-smoking room). the communal shower's drain was clogged so, despite only a trickle of water making its way out of the shower head, i was in standing water within a minute. it was easily the worst hotel in which i have stayed.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''a first class hotel is first class all the way, in every aspect, anticipating the guest needs before they arrive and doing their homework on their guest. the savoy london failed in this area. no recognition for being an amx centurion member. no acknowledgement for being loyal fairmont president club members. the first room given was so small i could not open my luggages, truly no joking. the room had shutters for the bathroom door. one half window that looked into the saddest view that i have ever seen with fake flowers in some pot looking at you. disgusting! i felt like i was sleeping in a box. i felt claustrophobic. i changed rooms the second day to a better room that at least i could open my luggages. what pissed me off was the fact the front desk agent had rooms to upgrade me to however their supervisor did not approve the upgrade as they wanted to upsell the rate. already paying 800$ us a night you would think you would get a room that at least. you could open. your luggages in and have a bathroom where the door was a real door not a pair of wooden shutters! when i think of my experience at the famous savoy hotel i laugh because it was so bad and was far from the first class experience that i was anticipating. two weeks before staying here i stayed at the mandarin oriental london hyde park and that hotel has it right, knowing how to treat their customers, first class all the way!!! time for the savoy to take lessons from other hotels in their category of business or step away from this competitive market. if in london again i would not choose this hotel again as there are other first class hotels that have better prices and better services than this one. i have to admit, commend and recognize the stellar bellman that looked after our bags and the stellar concierge that booked our car service back to lhr. both were outstanding and deserve merit ay from this poor review of the general hotel. one more thing that i have to mention which bothered me was the plastic curtain rods in the room to mp e th curtains. have you heard of automated curtains or at least rods that will actually pull the curtain rather than doing nothing and risking breaking in your hand. the towel warming rods were always on which was a huge safety hazard if traveling with children. the last hotel we stayed at you could turn on and off the hot towel rods. no never again. shame on the savoy for claiming to be a first class hotel.'''",0
The Lanesborough,"'''we booked a dairy free afternoon tea in this hotel, following the amazing reviews on the topic on both time out and the website of the hotel - to say we were disappointed with the offer, it is an understatement! we booked with more than two weeks in advance, and made it clear our dietary requirements. when we got there, a very polite waiter advised us he would check with the chef what the option were for the day - he never came back and after 10min a different waiter came to advise that we could only have the sandwiches and a fruit salad. clearly nothing was prepared in advance for our visit and we had to seat there watching others having this amazing choice of sweets while we ate what every lower than average restaurant offers for people with this type of allergy. the cherry on top of the cake was that we were charged exactly the same as the normal menu when we could not even eat it! this misleading advertisement should not be allowed for such a glamorous hotel.'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''having stayed once before was looking forward to a three night stay in a junior suite, booked direct with hotel. | helpful, courteous pick up at airport from an early morning flight. was informed at check in that the room type we had booked was not yet ready, hardly surprising as it was still only 0800. we were offered a ""very nice superior room"" as being available immediately. having slept adequately in overnight first on tg and being keen to get out and explore we were happy to wait for the junior suite to become ready later in the day. i was not given any other information on the room we were being offered to know whether to accept it or not and was concerned not to end up paying for a basic room when i had booked a ""junior suite"". | what a mistake! the ""suite"" was adjacent to intrusive ac compressors, and was best described as low ceilinged council house 1980s chic overlooking more of the same - think peabody trust without the altrusitic pricing structure. lots of swaggy curtains, yet nowhere to unpack a suitcase and a holiday inn style bathroom with a marble tiled makeover. except the shower screen din't fit and meant the bathroom floor was drenched whenever one showered. | despite assurances that our luggage would be in the room when we returned at 2.30 pm, it was not. the receptionist who escorted us to the room assured me he would arrange for it immediately once the oversight was realised. i imagine he forgot. 20 minutes later i called the bell desk, the luggage arrived about 10 minutes later. | we decided to freshen up before dinner with a steam to sweat out 11 hours of flying. the spa / steam room was closed for renovation. i was starting to get a bit tetchy by this stage, but the concierge was helpful and arranged for us to use the steam room at the park lane hilton. that, followed by a pint in shepherds market, made me realise that there were numerous alternative hotels that would work for us and offering better value too. on our return i informed the receptionist that we planned to check out early. she helpfully informed me that we had already been given a room upgrade and that there was nothing to be done. i would hoped for service - not freebie upgrades. shame. | we returned to the room just after 8pm. it had not been made up. | i called the duty manager, more to vent frustration at the p--- poor service and vfm that the dorchester was peddling. to his credit he seemed concerned and to want to make a difference. he asked what he could do to make amends. having irretrievably lost faith in the dorchester's ability to deliver service or value it might have helped more if he could have suggested something himself. in my jetlagged state i could only suggest he made sure our revised check out date was noted by reception so that i could move to a hotel that ""did what it says on the tin"". | a bill of around 800 pounds for an overnight stay was presented in the morning. we moved to the park lane sheraton, which promises rather less but delivered substantially more - at half the price. | the positives? breakfast is pretty good. should be at 35 pounds or so, but i do not begrudge paying for quality. | sadly, the rest of our dorchester ""experience"" fell shamefully short.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''i stayed for three nights in a supposedly superior room at over 300 per night. the room overlooked a courtyard full of pipes and grotty machinery with a noisy aircon unit just outside my window. i was promised a king size bed - what i actually got were two beds pushed together, all night i kept falling bewteen them. the bathroom radio did not work and when i turned the tap of the bath, rusty water poured out. the corridor carpets are worn and the whole place needs a revamp. it simply is not worth the extra cost if you are looking for something a little special (which it is not) and i get the impression the hotel is resting on its name. the grill and the american bar have great atmospheres, but as a staying guest at the hotel you do not get any special privaleges. i was turned away from the bar at around 7pm because it was too full - generally with people off the street who have come in for a drink but are not staying. the mangement need to sort their act out if the hotel has any chance of surviving. i would happily go there to eat but not ever again to stay.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''to be honest i want to give a higher rating but our last nights stay ruined it. we stayed here for 3 nights... 31st dec - 02nd january i did not tell them it was my 21st birthday on the 31st dec however my partner brought my presents along and banners and everything, i was extremely disappointed when we came back later on in the day when the cleaners had been that no gift of good will was left, it would have been special and nice if you had left me a small glass of champagne, it would have been an extra touch, so you disappointed me there, we spent so much money staying here. also we got a note that a fire alarm test will go off on 02 jan at 11am but at 1.35am monday 02nd jan the fire alarm went off we panicked and got dressed, was this a real test or the practise?? no one else knew what to do on the floor??!!!! after 10 mins of the alarm going off and on you finally got on your tannoy and said do not evacuate the building and that someone had set it off accidentally!!! you left that too late!!!!! so thanks for that. you ruined my birthday weekend. opposite there was also a party going in the room, there was not an option to ring down to reception on the room phone??!!! so i had to ring off my mobile to complain to you and send up security to throw them out. so thanks for waking me up at 1.35am and kept me awake for at least 2 hours after. this is why i am giving you 2 stars. i would not return after this, i expect this in a cheap hotel but not an expensive one.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''it is unfortunate to be writing a negative review for the corinthia. after all, the property was beautiful, the furnishings were comfortable and the staff was exceedingly polite. but the hotel tragically falls short in meeting the needs of a business traveler to london. | wi-fi coverage was spotty, which staff members were unapologetic about since the service is free. but i would have gladly paid for reliable coverage ... just imagine being a business traveler without access to email. it was also impossible to reach the reception desk by phone, which became an issue because the room was unbearably hot. it was surreal returning to a flawlessly-designed hotel room in which i could not relax or work after a full day of meetings. what is the point of staying in a luxury hotel that cannot get the basics right? does it really matter that they have a spa when i am struggling to meet a client deadline? next time i am in london, i will stay at a lesser chain like the westin or hyatt that actually understands what i need when i am on the road for business.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''yes, we were requested to pay when the savoy could not fulfil our booking. we had requested 2 double rooms, as near to each other as possible. when arriving at the hotel these rooms were unavailable and we were told that we could then have a junior suite with adjoining room. great, we thought. it was to celebrate my 50th and that would be lovely. however, there would be a charge of 150 + vat, 180 in total. oh dear, we have to pay more even though it is not our fault. so we declined and said will have the original rooms please. with that the receptionist asked her superior who then said it would be complimentary. this should have been so from the beginning. i do not think the savoy have mastered the art of customer relations/services and they do not want to go the extra inch, let alone mile !! they tried it on and unfortunately first impressions count so i cannot recommend the hotel, in case this happens to anyone else. | i will also add that the breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. a full english is what this country is noted for and the savoy's efforts leave much to be desired. it should be a hearty, good quality meal that sets you up for the day. we had a sparse little effort, which looked very lost on the plate. there were lots of muffins, dry danish pastries and toast, but more attention should be given to the cooked breakfast.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''was very much looking forward to staying at the iconic dorchester hotel. this was definitely on my list of hotels to stay in worldwide and i had been extremely excited about my visit. | first impressions were ok but not great. check-in was smooth but on arrival in the room we found a letter addressed to another guest (mr long) and also one of our key cards did not work. these were minor issues, but something which should not really happen at the dorchester. | during our stay we had afternoon tea, evening meal and an attempt at breakfast (more of that later). afternoon tea was delightful with an amazing abundance of sandwiches and cakes. service was a little patchy with waiters bordering on the arrogant but this was the only time i experienced arrogance in the hotel. food in the evening appeared to be of a very high standard with superb service. breakfast again was amazing in terms of service but i only managed a small piece of toast as by this time i had succumbed to food poisoning which started in the early hours of the morning. my poor wife then had to put up with me being terribly ill and ruining our stay. | my bout of food poisoning lasted the best part of a week and resulted in me losing 7kg of weight and being terribly ill. having had to fill in various food questionnaires linked to my illness i can only surmise that the relevant foods were eaten earlier in the day at the dorchester (i had not eaten chicken previously for more than a week and chicken was deemed to be the source of the poisoning). | samantha (pa to the director of food at the dorchester) has been very thorough in managing my complaint and dealing with me, but more than three weeks have passed since i initially notified the hotel of my food poisoning and so far they have provided me with no results (tests are still being carried out). this is somewhat strange as my test results were back within 48 hours! i cannot help but think that i am being strung along until i lose interest. | what this event has taught me is that no matter how amazing the service or how good the setting, food poisoning is terrible and something that no guest should get. in my opinion the dorchester was responsible for my food poisoning and absolutely ruined what should have been an amazing experience for both my wife and myself. the only positive is that i managed to keep the weight off for christmas!'''",0

Rhodes Hotel,"'''154 out of 1,053 hotels in london? i just do not believe it! | i booked two nights in december, needed somewhere near paddington, and booked this place on the strength of its rating. | my first surprise was that i was put in an annex round the corner from the hotel. i would booked through expedia and nowhere in the hotel description was an annex mentioned! (it was mentioned in a separate email sent by the hotel some days after i would booked, but i did not notice it in the small print). so i had a five minute walk in the freezing cold to get my breakfast! | the second was the size of the room, i have stayed in a number of london hotels and have had a lot of ""small"" single rooms, but this must have been the smallest yet! about six feet wide and eight feet long would be my guess. they had done their best to cram in as many facilities as possible, but there was not anywhere to put my open case except the one chair in the room! | the staff were pretty good overall, and i got an upgraded breakfast, (the breakfast room is pretty small, and i saw that some people had to queue for a table). | i am sure this is not the worst hotel in london, but i am also sure that it does not belong in the top ten percent either!'''",0
The Savoy,"'''what a disappointment, the savoy delivered well below our expectations. we stayed in a deluxe room on the 8th floor of the edwardian wing. room has nothing special; a standard 5star room with no features of a ""grand"" hotel. communal areas are nice and grand but you do not have to stay here to see them. but most disappointing was the lack of details; no welcome card, no welcome fruit/amenity, no chocolate or any other detail at turndown, not even complimentary water at turndown!! we were informed that complimentary turndown water is available upon request and you have to request it every night!! all services and extras that are standard even in business 5 stars were non existing. we felt that the hotel was in a cost cutting mood trying to save cost from every single thing. even at breakfast, we had to remind the waiter for our bakery basket that was part of the menu only to be told that he did not bring it as most guests do not want it!! overall a total let down; clearly fairmont is trying to milk the ""savoy"" name and legacy. if you like to feel special and valued, do not go to this hotel.'''",0
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''if it were not for one member of staff, this would have received five stars easily. | we took my father-in-law for afternoon tea and we all agreed that we had possibly the best sandwiches of any hotel. the waiting staff could not have been more attentive or professional, it really was five star service. | sadly, the matre d' was not so good. my family and i play cards of all kinds wherever we go. restaurants, bars, trains, planes and boats, all offer a great opportunity to play. we never play poker or gamble in anyway, just some wist or cribbage to pass the time. | i was greatly upset when the matre d' came to our table in the saloon to tell us we were not permitted to play cards. when i asked why, he said it was hotel policy that gambling was not allowed. when i assured him we were not gambling, he simply said card playing was not permitted, but could not elaborate. when i asked to speak to someone in authority, he told me he/she would come to us when they returned. we never saw this person. | i have never been told to stop playing cards anywhere and although it is only a minor affront, it is one i felt grossly unnecessary and left me feeling embarrassed. for me, it rather tarnished what was to be a special afternoon in a lovely hotel.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''i was staying at the savoy on a business trip. my room was broken into and i was robbed of 3 laptops. they were too large to go into the safe. they were not out and visible, but kept in cases under a chair in the room. apparently the thieves had used a housekeeping closet to access the roof and break into my window. key records showed that there were a number of staff entries into my room that day, many of them after 6pm - when the crime took place. the hotel said it was turndown service, but when i entered my room at 10:30pm, my bed had not been turned down. the hotel offered me a ""river view"" room as consolation for my loss. i only wanted a room without a rooftop nearby. not that it mattered... but there was no river view. i was disappointed in the hotel's response. all they kept saying was ""this never happens here."" other staff members told me it happens frequently.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''my friends paid 250 for a giftcard in the london hotel for me to have a great meal at ""dinner"", but when it came to paying my bill after the meal they said the card was only worth 180 !!! | it seems they have a nice little scheme going where they convert the card to usd, then convert back at their own extraordinarily bad exchange rate, therefore making a nice margin for themselves. a real shame as the restaurant was very good, but my only defence was to take the service off the bill, which was not fair to the staff. however, beware the rip off card scheme !!!'''",0
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we booked a double room for 1 night. the staff were very helpful because we were running late to go to a concert at the royal albert hall and so called them to ask if we could check in after the concert instead of before it. this was not a problem and checking in was fine with a very nice man. we had a drink in the bar where again the barman was very nice and then went up to our room. we were given room 201. if you stay at this hotel do not accept room 201 !!! room 201 was so small and noisy. we had a standard double bed, smaller than queen size. to get into bed on both sides we could not walk down the side of the bed we had to turn sideways. the bathroom door opened into the room as the bathroom was too small for the door to have been hinged in any other way. the gap between the toilet and towel rail was just wide enough to stand sideways and to get into the shower cubicle it was necessary to turn sideways. to make it worse outside the window of our room are the airconditioning units for the kitchens and or the entire hotel which were very noisy and made sleeping difficult and sporadic. on checking out we were asked how was our stay. i complained about the room size and noise and was unhelpfully told that the rooms are small due to the age of the building. we also completed the guest questionaire and made the points about room size and noise and to date no feedback from the manager. we were very disappointed with our room in such a lovely hotel.'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''this hotel is quite handily placed, near paddington rail and underground stations, but apart from that, has nothing to recommend it. the twin room was minute, with only about a foot between the beds, and was scruffy, old fashioned and not particularly clean. the bathroom was modern, and quite clean, but tiny. as we arrived, the owner was having quite a heated argument with someone on the phone, who was obviously complaining - not very professional. the person who showed us to our room apologised about the mess, as he said they had the workmen in. there was an unplumbed toilet on the landing and a bag of cement and we were certainly in no doubt about the workmen at 9am the next morning when their drilling began. the breakfast was very poor and in fact we did not bother getting up for it the next day, however we could not have a lie-in as the driller was back! the refurbishment is definitely overdue, but perhaps the hotel should close whilst it is being done. do not go-opt for a travelodge instead!'''",0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i chose this hotel to celebrate my marriage with my dearest friends. under guidance of the staff of the hotel i chose the room ""river view balcony"" for the three nights stay so to enjoy the beautiful view over the city and the extra space in the room for private toasts. | the reservation had occurred a few months before the date of staying and marriage to have time to develop the refreshments into the prestigious rumpus bar with choice of wines and canaps. | at this point my wife and i left a credit card each to guarantee all reservations. | upon arrival at the hotel last february after an inexplicable lack of knowledge about my card details i was asked for a credit card to guarantee the booking so i re-submitted my mastercard for it. | the amount keyed in however exceeded the price of the staying of 100 per night just in case of extras but the concierge said promptly this was just a pre-booking precaution and that the exact amount would be taken at the end of staying and that any remaining money from it would come back into my account right away. | despite our initial reluctance of such procedure, taking into account my wife had already paid in advance for the refreshments, we understood this was just the hotel policy so we trusted the hotel staff. | room: the large space with sublime views of the thames and the city enjoys a modern and stylish decor. the room has large windows so it is rather cold and boasts of a unique heating system with heat pumps of which only one functioning over the bed and extremely noisy. no heating in the master bathroom and in the guest one. the technician sent to us by the concierge could not tell us why and what neither of it nor to make it works. | rumpus bar: upon arrival with our friends we discovered that the reserved space is not the one chosen months ago with a view of the thames and the city. negotiations were long not to mention frustrating and involved also one of the guests considering the unique event; eventually the manager of the bar has solved by moving us in front of the windows and personally taking care of all the refreshments. | service: in general the hotel staff was very kind but throughout the period has been shown to be lacking in professionalism and preparation with customers. it has been very frustrating having to ask for everything when in the hotel of such category you expect outstanding service and fast solution problems. very serious the total lack of communication when in the middle of the night the fire alarm went off, leaving all guests unaware and worried about the problem. | check out: at the time of payment i have listed all the inconveniences suffered to the manager that as apology deducted a night fare from the total bill. having already left a larger sum at the beginning of the booking i was issued the invoice for the actual amount payable and guaranteed that the remaining amount would be returned in my availability within 24 hours. | it took 15 days to un-locked the sum initially frozen upon arrival at the hotel. during that period the amount actually collected by the hotel has weighed further on the amount set aside as a pre-booking precaution leaving me in serious trouble here in italy. during these days my wife had to call and write to the managers of the hotel to resolve the matter. to note the total lack of service and professionalism demonstrated once again by the staff heedless of the damage that such freezing sum caused to my personal life. | despite being in a perfect area and looking beautiful this hotel need to decide whether to decrease the stars and the prices or change personnel before many other customers encounter these same problems if not more ruining the reputation of mondrian as a chain.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''after have a wonderful stay at the ritz 2 years ago, the good wife of 30 years wanted to stay at the savoy, an equally well established and historical hotel. or so i thought. | of all the reviews i have written, i truly struggle with this one. i have read the glowing reviews of the savoy which i suppose, provided me confidence of booking this hotel after we had previously stayed at the ritz hotel. | well, against most reviewers, my experiences were totally different which causes me my struggle in this review. | maybe i was the unlucky one, but a few things occurred which caused me great concern, particularly given the cost of this hotel and the level of service expected adjoining such, something that we expected for a special occasion being our 30th wedding anniversary. | from the start, our tv was not working which we promptly reported. after leaving and going around london for a look and see before settling in for the night, we returned to find the tv still not working. again after a call for assistance, and after two attempts, finally success, much to my wife's displeasure as she was hoping to get some well earned sleep. | later that night, after making a mid night visit to the toilet, almost slipped over and fell on the,,,,well you know. the reason why, the air conditioning was leaking water from the ceiling above and ponding on a polished marble floor. that is two, but hey things happened do not they ?. | for those who have not stayed at the hotel, it would have to be the most difficult hotel to navigate with wings left, right and lifts at various places within different levels to get to ground floor. to say it is confusing is an understatement. again after a long walking, we found our room and found the credit card type keys, not working. that is three now and that was enough to tip me over the edge after a day's stay. | after many apologizes and offers of some sort of compensation for which i declined all, i basically told them, guys,,,, the ritz you are not and this is simply not good enough. | trying to put it behind us, we continued to ignore the standard and simply viewed the hotel as a place to sleep. sad, but that is the truth. just when i started to forget the three unfortunate experiences, i said to the good wife, let us go for a nightcap at the bar. | sorry sir, we are full at the moment was the reply, but we were afforded a drink outside. | after a few nuts to nibble on and quiet drink, i sense something was wrong when a few security guards started to hover. then the thundering steps and sounds of two, i believe, over intoxicated guests being forcibly removed with women screaming in fear, greeted. now this is a first for me, i thought. why would the guests be so intoxicated ?? | well the answer is simple, the bar is open to outside guests and on friday evening, well its a busy time. so, here i am paying a bucket full of pounds to stay here, many within the bar were not, and i am waiting outside for a seat. | enough,,,this place is simply not good enough. | there is no exclusivity, no sense of luxury, no sense of attending to the good paying guests of this hotel. what a waste of pounds and time in taking my wife of 30 years here. | do yourself a favor, if you are considering the savoy or the ritz, go to the ritz hotel, there you will be appreciated, welcomed by name, treated respectfully and you will feel that you are part of an exclusive hotel. | this place regretfully, fell short on all accounts and i am still annoyed over the cost for this terrible experience, even though i have been back home for 2 weeks now'''",0

"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''i stayed here with my friend as a special treat .... the rooms are lovely - until the airconditioning starts to drip inside the wall! this happens around 7am. not sure why .... no real explanation was given. | also, the service charge is added to everything - it leaves it very embarrassing if you are with guests and do not feel the 12% is justified - when you book a room - service charge, order a glass of wine - service charge etc. it all says its discretionary but is very embarrassing when the waiter comes back and questions why the whole bill has not been paid!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''the only reason to stay at this hotel is location to the museums. | after paying for an upgrade to fine my tv did not even work is not acceptable for a place like this. | i then went for breakfast to find self service, deep fried rubbish. | i do not know why every hotel in london i have been, which are all top end just do not care about breakfast. | this hotel provide frozen hash browns deep fried, the bacon is just dropped in a frier as well as the sausages. | bad bad bad. | then to wake up the the photo attached is absolutely not acceptable. | but like i said the only reason this hotel is still open is location.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i booked three rooms with my wife and 4 adult children; we were celebrating my youngest daughter's 18th birthday and so i wanted a good experience as part of her birthday celebration. the booking process was fine by email and a week before we arrived i received an email asking if we had any special requirements. i emailed back to say that we wanted to have tea in the river lounge, and received a reply to say that was fully booked. i just do not understand a premium hotel that makes no effort to accommodate paying guests, a point i made in my reply but there was no answer. we could have tea in our rooms-but that is hardly a treat, and besides tea in one of the rooms for 6 would not have been possible. | staff took an age to answer the phone for things like room service etc; other hotels apply a three rings policy. at the savoy the team just seemed not to care. | the final straw was breakfast on the morning after our night; we went down at 10.30 to find both venues fully occupied. we asked for a table and were told we had to wait 10 minutes; we stood around for half an hour when i started to press staff for a table. eventually we sat down at 11.15am, and then waited an age for service of any food and drinks. staff were frazzled and a bit rude and they were clearly under strain. i cannot remember another occasion when i have had such an experience in any grade of hotel. | so, given we could not enjoy a facility which is a main attraction (afternoon tea), and our breakfast was a disaster, my memory is only of the bed which was comfortable. the rooms are a bit small and unremarkable.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed for four nights in a river view balcony suite. great view, lovely cocktails. | everything else - and i mean *everything* - was terrible. the service was outrageously bad. so bad that it became funny. and then even the humour wore off. | when we complained, our complaints were handled terribly. | ""are you sure you had glass in your food? that is the first we have heard of it."" | would need to be seriously tired or drowned in cocktails to return.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''for 317 a night for a two person room, what would you expect? | easy and on time check in? | amazing spa facilities? | top notch room that takes your breath away? | my sister and i was bitterly disappointed. | we checked into our twin room (which was supposed to be a double) and it was so small and pokey. initially they told me our room would only be ready one hour after check in and i told the lady i wanted a room immediately since it was already 30 mins past check in time. | there were two chairs and a table that look like they were lifted from a conference room, the decor was bland, the bathroom was just as small. there were only power points on one side of the bed, the tv was tiny and the bathoom walls were so thin, we could hear the clear conversations from the people in the room above. | we ordered room service which we asked if the rembrandt sharer platter would cater for two people. | 2 chicken wings, | 2 prawn bites, | about 4 potato wedges, | 3 onion rings | 1/2 a 1/2 of garlic bread | each does not count as a substantial meal. the 16 meal turned into a 20 meal with the addition of tray and service charge. | going down to receive our massage treatments, the service was just average. my treatment involved the masseur playing cd that kept getting stuck and after 3 mins of the stickiness, assuming that she would change the track, i told her to skip it so i could relax. then my sister and i went to the swimming pool area which was so small and felt like a budget leisure centre. the jacuzzi was nice but the button to turn it on was so far away, you had to get out of the jacuzzi and walk to turn it on again. | the relaxation room was a bunch of uncomfortable leather chairs, 2 bean bags and 2 recliners in a dark conference room with some candles. the only part we liked were the free frutella sweets. | this place simple was a massive rip off. i would never recommend this place to anyone unless they like to waste their money. i am just glad we never paid for this room ourselves.'''",0
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''unfortunately for this business traveler, the wellesley is just not a good fit. it took them forever to check me in (20 minutes+), and it took almost 20 minutes around midnight to find out whether it would be possible to get a late check-out. for the cost of the hotel, one would expect five-star service, but it lacks all of the finesse that a truly fine property has. the lunch service was erratic (initially too fast, and then painstakingly slow), and the lobby smells like cigarette smoke because people are allowed to smoke on the terrace, and the person who serviced my room just made the bed - he/she did not ""tidy"" up at all, which is usually customary at a 5 star hotel (i.e. - the hairdryer was not put away, towels were not hung up, etc.). the rooms themselves are lovely as are many of the staff (butler, check-in desk) . i just have a hard time suggesting that people should stay here because the level of service does not justify the cost.'''",0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the mondrian is a beautiful and stylish property centrally located in downtown london with easy access to many popular tourist attractions. the rooms are quite nice and the amenities are plentiful. we felt it is attractiveness ended at that point. the staff while smiling and pleasant can turn cold and unfeeling at a moment's notice. my fianc and i were treated very nicely on arrival and told we were eligible for a river-view room upgrade through our platinum status at a rate of 215 pounds. i happened to glance at an email alert the next day to find out the room rate was actually over 400 pounds the first evening. when i went to reservations to question this issue the staff became cold and uncaring claiming the 215 pounds were in addition to the regular room rate. neither my fianc heard this explanation. luckily there were standard rooms available and we switched back. what we felt was that while the property was lovely many of the staff members with the exception of the concierge, acted like it was a privilege for us to be staying there from the reservations manager to the wait staff. one evening we were dressed formally for a performance downtown and decided to go down for a cocktail. a staff member outside the bar yelled ""can i help you!"" in my fianc's face and frankly startled both of us. the look on his face said ""you do not belong here"". in the end we enjoyed our time in london as well as the people of that fine city. we only wish the mondrian could have made us feel more welcome.'''",0
Marble Arch Hotel,"'''this hotel was not what we expected. we had booked and paid for a triple room, instead we got a standard room with two single beds! and there was still something in the toilet when we arrived! the rooms are out dated and the whole place looks like a prison cell! the staff are beyond rude! if you think there is wifi here, think again, there is internet access, between the hours of 7am - 6pm. so if you miss that deadline, which you probably because you will most likely be out sightseeing, i guess you just cannot speka to your family and friends back home during your stay, if you do however get a chance to use the computers please note that you can only use them for 15 minutes and that is all for the day, yes there is someone watching at the desk to tell your time is up and that is all you are allowed for the day!!! very wrong!!!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''what a disappointment!! | service was non existent...after a 20 minute wait, i had to go &amp; find a member of staff to remind them we were sitting waiting. no teaspoons with cups &amp; saucers, only 4 sugar lumps in sugar bowl, no jam with scones, no plain scones, extremely uninspiring sandwiches &amp; a choice of two awful looking cakes!! | throughout our tea, not one member of staff checked to see if everything was ok. | not a good advert for traditional afternoon tea at all &amp; on top of all this, 2 large tv screens on the wall playing sport along with an extremely noisy function taking place in the adjoining room. | overall, a very disappointing experience which we certainly will not be repeating!'''",0

Marble Arch Hotel,"'''i stayed one night at the marble arch hotel for a business trip. i was disappointed the moment i saw the building. it looked more than an apartment building than a 5 star hotel. i was hoping that the exterior did not reflect how the interior looked like and i could not be more mistaken. the lobby was more like a hallway.. so narrow and small. everything was like a miniature and i could not believe that this was a 5 star hotel. all the hallways were tiny as if i was walking through an ancient underground burial ground. the room was the smallest room i have seen in my life. you barely have space to walk around the bed.. no room to open the luggage, not to mention the moldy smell throughout the entire hotel. the window is also tiny and it overlooks a dump or something like that. i am claustrophobic and i refused to stay in this room. i was upgraded to a larger room which was also small but at least it had a seating area. | the bathroom was nice and new but also very small. the reception and service were excellent though. the location is unremarkable but you get free internet. i would never stay in this hotel again due to the small room sizes.'''",0
Newham Hotel,'''i stayed here for one night ahead of the 100-mile ridelondon event. other than being near the start of the event the rest of the experience was very unpleasant. | the hotel is very dated and in poor state of repair. it is on a busy road and the windows do not seal properly which means that at night it sounds like you are sleeping on the pavement. the noise issue is compounded by the fact that the wooden floors are in bad shape and and you can feel/hear everyone walking past your room. the bathroom was tiny and dirty. so dirty that i decided that i was better off not having a shower at all. | never again.''',0

The Savoy,"'''stayed one night. it is a good location for the west end and never stayed before. lucky us. | i must say the public spaces are impressive. the details on doors, floors, ceilings are beautiful. the staff are well drilled, if not always 100% friendly. good start. | after that though things take a bit of a dive. finding the rooms is not easy, with maze like corridors and long walks which ever way you go. once you find your room, the first impression is ok, but i wanted to be blown away. | decor was a bit aunt mildred. britain is not swirly patterns and frilly stuff any more. phew. the green glass chandelier was pretty modern, but looked incongruous in the room. | the marble in the bathroom continued the theme. that old fashioned grey and white stuff. also the step into the bathroom manages to be a trip hazard on the way in and out. ok the shower is amazing it might just be the best i have ever had, but the bath water ran orange for 5 minutes before clearing. note to manager: sort out the old rusty pipes. | then the wifi. it only allows one device at a time to connect. this is deliberate and just plain mean. given that our interior facing room had no mobile signal at all this becomes a worse problem. | finally breakfast was poor. ordered to our room, the toast was shop sliced, cold and limp. the croissants - very tesco metro. coffee though was good. | you know it is not bad, but this is the savoy. so many of the details betrayed a management pinching pennies or ignoring the details. thankfully someone else was picking up my 350 bill. if it was my money i would have been livid. as it was, i am just disappointed.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''in 2000 i stayed at this hotel and, at the time, it was fabulous. it was well maintained; the breakfast buffet was excellent; and the overall appearance of the hotel was impressive. | i was slightly disappointed when i arrived there with three colleagues and found that, although the lobby had been remodeled and there was free internet service there, things just were not the same. | upon my arrival, i was placed in a first-floor room with no air conditioning. (i asked to be moved to a higher floor the next day.) the decor had not changed since the early 1990s, i think. i was looking forward to the breakfast buffet and found only a skimpy, low-quality assortment of english breakfast standards. the rooms were clean. but the linens and the furniture are in need of an update. | i am assuming that the hotel chain just bank s on the fact that the hotel is in a prime spot in knightsbridge (across from the victoria &amp; albert museum).'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''i have been to the dorchester many times, some of which were to eat at china tang and others were visits to the bar. on this occasion myself and a friend simply wanted to stop by for a cup of coffee in their lounge area at 9pm - they said we could but it would be 30 minimum spend per person. it was practically empty and they still wanted to enforce a minimum spend even though we only wanted coffee. we would just had a huge dinner nearby and only wanted a drink before we went home. we declined and went to the lanesborough down the road which is always welcoming and you can sit and have as little or as much as you want. i think it is a bit ridiculous to enforce a minimum spend like that especially as no other 5* hotels i have been to do this...

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",'''i had seen this hotel during previous stays in the kensington area and booked it as other reviews had given it a high rating. when we arrived we were given `a complementary upgrade to a superior room`. i would hate to think what the `standard rooms1 are like. our room was very small with one side of the double bed pushed up against the wall and an 18inch gap on the other side. the room was well appointed but this did not make up for the lack of space. the bathroom was equally compact. the reception staff were pleasant but showed little interested when i made a comment about the room size. | i note that most of the previous poor and average reviews on this website reflect the same issues we encountered. | there are plenty of better/larger hotel rooms in the kensington area in this price range.''',0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''a nice hotel, but slow service in the very dark dandylion bar (not enough light to read the menu!) - especially when asking for the bill. they even had the cheek to pit a service charge on top - removed. | significantly, our room was entered at 2230 by a female who was seen walking purposefully towards where our bags were. challenged and ran out of the room. | immediate call to reception - no knowledge. ditto at checkout. following an email by me to the 'front of house team', eventually informed that this was a ""turn down service '....really ; 1030pm??'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''booked 2 rooms as we took our daughter and grandson to an event at the o2. hotel was basic but appeared clean and accommodating. we returned to sleep and although it is on a very busy road, we slept until we were woken at 3am by water pouring from one of the lights. the receptionist tried to help, but with an option of change room or change bedding and hope it did not happen again, it was difficult. we did not want to move as we were close to our family in the other room and it would have taken time to pack up. but it was a risk to stay in the room. we agreed to have the bed remade and stay in the room. this was completed, but by now we had been awake for over an hour and found it hard to go back to sleep. the following morning we checked out. the receptionist was back to the person who checked us in. i asked if he was aware of the event overnight. he said he was, but made no acknowledgement of it or offered any apology. when i said that i was not prepared to make a full payment for the room he responded by telling me that we had been offered another room so did not understand my complaint. i asked if there was anyone that i could speak to about my complaint but he said he was the supervisor and could not authorise any refund. he gave me a piece of paper with a phone number and email address on stating that i could email my complaint to head office. i have done this and had no response at all. i am now going down the credit card route. if you are thinking of booking a room here, do not. but if you still ho ahead, do not accept room 1!!! terrible stay, disrupted sleep which spoils the next day sightseeing as we were all so tired. awful response to our complaint for the sake of a few pounds. could have been resolved with an apology and consideration.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''honestly there are better places to stay in london, like the me hotel on the strand for instance... | the location is very good but everything else was not. | we chose a deluxe river view room and paid well over 400 for one night. | once we got into the room, we realised that the st paul cathedral view was obstructed by the central part of the building, so different from the photo of our booking page. | i call reception to ask to be moved reminding them that this was a special birthday occasion and i paid for a full view... reception responded that they would get back to us but never did; i prompt them with another call after 1 hour and even then they did not call back. | in the morning at the time we were packed to leave we had a card through the door with a 15 discount happy birthday card, nice gesture, a bit too late... | checking out - the wait was much longer than you would expect for a 5 star hotel | certainly not an experience of luxury more so one of feeling dismissed and let down. would not recommend it.'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''stayed for 1 night for an event at the olympic park. was the only hotel we could find, now i know why. rooms were damp and the decor, furniture and generally overall the hotel was in an appalling condition. room door did not lock properly (electronic key lock) and in fact opened a few times while we were in the room. no bedside lights at all only the main room light. tv could only be viewed from one of the beds in the room. hair drier was hard wired in the middle of the headboard at a height meaning you could not use it. wall paper peeling away from walls, carpets were dirty. bathmat was actually a mat for a toilet. towels were very small and not enough left in room to have one each. requested some more towels at reception, their response was to collect some when we return as there was no-one in from housekeeping... not even an offer to put in the room for us. the bathroom was adequate but again dirty and in need of a revamp. woke in the morning to find water pouring out of the ceiling in the hall way outside our room. pool table was not working and looked like it had not for a long time as the notice had faded and the tape was becoming dry and detached. breakfast was served in a room that liked a greasy spoon cafe! breakfast was buffet self serve which was not ideally located. breakfast was luke warm. receptionist welcome and departure was not inviting. this has to be the worst hotel i have ever stayed in for both staff attitude, cleanliness and appearance! in all a pretty disgusting establishment, no point complaining just do not stay here!'''",0
The Savoy,"'''ok this is not actually a review of the hotel but rather the iconic american bar in the hotel. this place has of course a legendary name and i would been meaning to pop in for some time so finally managed to synch this during a couple of days say in the city over the xmas/new year break. first impressions did not go great, the maitre d was to a bit stuffy and despite the bar being empty wanted to sit myself and my good lady in the crappiest seat he could find - once we would set the scene by sitting somewhere completely different he seemed to get the measure of us! anyway this was not the issue i had with this place, what completely floored me was the fact that this bar resembled a foyer in a downmarket four seasons, cheap seats, unimaginative decor etc, this was supposed to be an homage to art deco - they spent 220m on the refit of the hotel and it looks like a tenner was budgeted for this bar! the drinks were professional but nothing special, price about average for a london 5* hotel....but i know plenty of places that could beat them hands down and cheaper. there was no piano player at the time we were in although it was early evening, however i doubt though even this would have lifted an atmosphere which i could only describe as a provincial bus shelter on a mid week night. | sorry savoy but this 'icon' is trading on days long since passed.'''",0

A To Z Hotel,"'''i had paid my deposit well in advance for a double room for my girlfriend and i, but when i got there was told that they had filled all of the double rooms for the night!! there was no apology nor reimbursement, and the two of us had to share a single bed in a cramped room!! the breakfast which was supposed to be included was not either. it was a really disappointing trip that thankfully did not set the tone for the entire weekend, although it is easy to see how it could have. the only reason that my review is two stars is because the room itself was clean and tidy, meaning it would be alright if you were travelling alone and pretty much broke (although no tea/coffee making facilities nor shampoo/shower gel means that you should pack prepared). who knows, they may even have filled your single room and have to give you a double instead(!)'''",0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i have wanted to stay at the hotel for a while and last month i had the opportunity while on business. | i only spent one night and arrived late and left straight after breakfast so have limited views on the bars and facilities of the hotel but felt i should share my experience. | first off the staff are great really helpful. the hotel in its design is a little disappointing, lots of expensive finishes but lacked any form of excitement or drama. i am sure the bars are great though. | the rooms also lack any real excitement, they are just nice rooms, not what you expect for such an expensive hotel. | but my biggest issue was breakfast. i have stayed in all sort of hotels from cheap to expensive and in london and abroad, the breakfast varies as one can expect but the mondrian breakfast should have been wonderfull. sadly it was not... the sausages were almost burnt one side and not cooked much the other and cold. the tomatoes were cols, the mushrooms were cold. the scrambled egg well i have no idea as it looked like soup and no way was i going to try it. i did order some poached eggs which were ok. but everything was cold and no taste at all. hugely disappointing which is such a same as it should have been amazing. was it a one off doubt it as a few others have had the same experience.'''",0

The Lanesborough,"'''we arrived in the hotel at 12pm, but had to wait 4 hours for check in, deapite the fact we were told to wait 2 hours. the reception area is a joke, there are only three chairs available, so we had nowhere to wait. we went to the afternoon tea restaurant and it was shocking (but that is the different story). the stuff in the hotel, are not friendly and quite arrogant. they seem to be wanting the tips all the time. rooms are very beautiful and comfortable, but some of the rooms are too cold and the heater is not working. the location is good, but the hotel is right next to a big road so car noises are there. too many tourists around the area, so its not a quite place. | what compeltely ruined the stay, is when we were checkig out. always check the bill!!! despite the fact that our breakfast was included, they included it in the bill and also some of the other imaginary quotes. it took us about an hour to remove this from the bill although we were late to the airport. all we got in the end from the receptionists is simple ""sorry"". i will never ever, under no circumstances, stay in this place.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''this hotel has to be the worst hotel that i have ever stayed in. | on arrival the manager and receptionist bickered between each other. i was then told the room that i was going to be in where upon the receptionist laughed to herself. i was then taken to my room which was not in the hotel but a block of old 1960's flats next to the hotel. i feared the worst when the person escorting me could not unlock the door. we then entered my room, which was unbelievable, as it looked like a student housing room which look like it had not been refurbished for the last 20 years. there was no flat screen tv as promised, the sink was dirty, the door above the sink that covered the electric boiler had obviously come of not been replaced, in general the place was scruffy as can be. to top it off the bathroom was not in the room and actually in the hall way and on closer inspection the lock on the door was missing. no wonder the receptionist was laughing!!! | i quickly made way to the reception desk where the manager and receptionist looked prepared for what was about to come - they actually blamed budgetplaces for not providing an accurate description of the room when booking - she kept saying hat i had paid for a basic room, which meant nothing to me - what the hell does this mean - i questioned the fact that the room that they had provided me was not good enough, it was not what i booked and why did they not have pictures of this on their website or why do not budget places have it on their website - they explained this was because they could not have any more pictures on the website - which is a whole load of tosh - actual reason is if they did then the likely hood is that they would not sell the rooms as they are that poor. on asking about the lock he said that he did not know about this, again a load of tosh surely people that have been thrown into these rooms would have mentioned this before. the room was also very warm - there is not air conditioning and had to keep the window open - so not much sleep to be had with the church next door holding some kind of party, plus there are animals - i presume rats that scurry and make lots of noise during the night in the back carpark. | they kept apologising but it was not sincere, and offered me a discount for the next time that i stayed, both the manager and receptionist looked and sounded well versed on their excuses and their lack of sympathy towards me - no customer service or people skills here. i felt like i was backed in a corner and had no other choice to stay in this room due to everywhere being fully booked. | location wise its a good location to get to stratford - so i cannot grumble at that but be warned people looking and thinking about booking a room in this hotel - make sure that the room you are booking is not in the building next to the hotel which does not feature in any of the pictures provided - its seriously not a good place to sleep. | what this hotel describes on their website is so far from what they actually deliver. why would i will not to come back here and get a discount on my next stay - i do not - but i want my money back and i doubt that is not going to happy'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''booked afternoon tea for saturday 11th march. turned up on time at 2:30pm. champagne served relatively quickly, then, after waiting a further 30 minutes, had to chase one (of the two) serving staff to ask where our food was. after another 10 minutes we were served a pretty sorry-looking effort, with four slabs of cake cut from a much larger cake, rather than the ""dainty cakes"" promised on the website. when we asked the server what the cakes were (which were two of each type, so he only had to know two cakes), he started to make a guess, but then admitted that he did not know. he went to the kitchen to find out. and informed us that they were carrot cake and a peach mousse cake. both were decidedly pedestrian. the sandwiches were very poorly cut (i know that this is very much a first-world problem!), with crusts half-on / half-off. we complained about the cakes being rather ordinary and the 40 minute wait, and were offered further cake. this never materialised. the excuse for the wait was that three other tables (totally 12 people) had turned up at the same time as us! this was not true, as we had got there 15 minutes earlier that the other three tables, and they should have been able to cope with four tables at the same time? we ended up being charged 30 each (plus 10% ""service"") for pretty poor food and service. to add insult to injury, i ended up spending the night in the bathroom with the trots, which i suspect was either due to the whipped cream or the clotted cream. please do not come here.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''as many of you know, this hotel chain prides itself on its excellent service. well, my husband and i stayed at this property for 3 nights in march/april 2007 and i have to say, the staff were ... cool towards us. perhaps because we do not 'look' like the average hotel guest (either with extreme business suits and cigars or draped in pearls to the floor), or maybe the staff think themselves 'above' most people. whatever their reasons, many of staff in this property were non-responsive, somewhat judgemental in their attitude or simply cool towards certain guests. unlike the four seasons hotel down the street - staff there were simply amazing. a consistent character of the four seasons. now we know better and probably will not stay at this property again. | andre goh'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''we booked this hotel online at short notice and did not read any of the reviews - big mistake! we were given a room close to reception at the front of the hotel (room number 4) and the room seemed ok but did have a strange smell, especially the bed linen. the tag line for this hotel is a good nights sleep but it definitely is not! people were walking past our room all night talking loudly and at 5am there was loud singing/chanting/laughter. we finally got some sleep around 7am and woke up around 8.30am. i tried to have a shower but there was no hot water so we decided to pack our case and load up the car before heading across the hall for breakfast only to find that the breakfast room was locked. we asked at reception and were told that breakfast is only served until 9am. this was a 9.05am and both my husband and i are sure that reception had told us breakfast was served until 10am. we had paid for breakfast and i explained that we had not had any sleep because of the noise but they would not even give us any toast! we will definitely not be staying here again and would urge others to think twice before booking here, the price may seem good value but you will regret it!'''",0

The Savoy,"'''my husband and i have several extended stays at the savoy each year, and we are getting fed up. let me be clear that i give it a ""poor"" rating by the global standards of five-star hotels. infrequent travelers looking for a fun night out might find it acceptable, but those who are on the road a lot or have more experience with five-star hotels know that the difference is in the details, and the details are where the savoy is sadly lacking. | while the shabby-chic splendor of the hotel pre-renovation was charming, it cannot be denied that the update is truly impressive. the rooms are outfitted splendidly, and the public spaces are grand. the problem is the staff. at least service is less chaotic than it was the year or two after the renovation. but it is still inconsistent, and this year we have noticed a marked downgrade in some of the services and amenities. it is no secret that the hotel is having financial difficulties, and one suspects they have begun to cut corners. for example, guests used to be provided lovely black slippers with the savoy logo. now it is just cheap oversized stock white slippers. they have also stopped providing custom stationary. a selection of newspapers used to be delivered free each morning, and now there is a charge. as fairmont platinum members, we used to receive an amenity that was refreshed daily -- usually fruit and large bottles of water. on our last arrival, we had to request the amenity, and then it was only refreshed inconsistently. we finally gave up asking, and the staff just removed the empty fruit bowl from our room. these may be just little things, but it gives the impression of nickel-and-diming -- not what you would expect from a five-star hotel. | here is an example of the little irritating lapses in service: in our last two-week stay, we were apparently overlooked on turn-down service several times. we had to call housekeeping after 9pm to request it. turn-down includes a bottle of water by the bed and a fresh glass. sometimes, housekeeping will not remove the dirty glasses during the day. if we do not move the dirty glasses off the nightstand, they will sometimes be reused by the turn-down staff! apparently, the culprit is whomever is responsible for refreshing the glasses during the day -- this is often not done, and sometimes we have a ""graveyard"" of used glasses on the coffee table, which we ultimately have to call to have removed. the turndown staff will not make the effort to go get clean glasses, of course. they will just leave the dirty ones, or failing that leave nothing. | now, this may seem a ridiculously petty thing to complain about. when i am at home, no one leaves me a fresh glass by the bedside at night. but when you are paying a lot of money to stay in a five-star hotel, you expect consistently excellent service. after a long work day, it is annoying to come back to the room and find a light bulb is still out in the bathroom, the tissues have not been refilled, or dirty glasses are stacked up on the table. | i have read a number of the poor reviews here, and they all ring true. we have had problems with the heat and the plumbing, frustrations with laundry, in-room dining, housekeeping, etc. on the weekends, we have seen food carts and trays left in the hallway all day long, with staff just walking by repeatedly without removing them. disgusting! | the only consistently excellent service we get is from the doormen, who are always polite and obliging. it is a pleasure to be greeted by them each time we enter the hotel -- it is a shame that feeling does not extend past the front doors.'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the only reason to book this hotel is because of the location, everything else was extremely disappointing. i was given room 228, situated up a number of flights of narrow stairs, really difficult if you have luggage. the room was really very small. i know this is london but the price paid 210 pounds for 2 nights was still more expensive than a london travel lodge i stayed in recently, which gave a much more comfortable experience. the bed was hard, blankets thin, pillows hard. i asked reception for two extra blankets and two extra pillows. i was given one stained blanket and a pillow case, not sure what they expected me to do with a lone pillowcase ??? the bathroom was tiny but had been refurbished, but it had no extractor fan so totally steamed up in minutes. i was told on arrival that the breakfast room was under refurbishment and that breakfast would be delivered to my room. this was a complete joke !! as i entered the room, there was already a few stale rolls wrapped in cling film and two over ripe bananas. they were inedible, not sure how long they had been there, but they did not replace during my stay. on departure i stated my disappointment and that i felt i should have been prewarned of the refurbishment. they had my email but failed to inform me. i was told at check out that they would send me some breakfast vouchers when the refurbishment was complete. in my mind this was not a compensation and i would definitely not stay in this hotel again.'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''what could go wrong did go wrong during our recent stay at the dorchester. and a previous guest, i can say without qualitifcation that the hotel is not even close to what it used to be. | starting with our arrival at the hotel on foot, the doorman did not even offer to help us with our bags but, rather, pointed to the door adjacent to the revolving door through which we pulled our own bags. | once in, there was a protracted wait at check in, and then when i produced the confirmation number for the hyde park view 39 sq. metre room i had booked through my travel agent, i was told abruptly that there had been a mistake, that the rate i was quoted was only for a mayfair rooftoop room of smaller dimensions. i insisted on the room we reserved and a manager was called, who said we could have it but only if we agreed to pay 65 gpb ($130) more each night. only when i produced the written confirmation for the room at the rate i was promised, did the manager ungraciously relent, and agree to the agreed-upon rate. | then, through a comedy of errors, the mini-bar inspector woke us from our jet lag nap, and the piercing fire alarms sounded during a test that concluded our rest. the phones all failed to work for a number of hours, for which the front desk barely apologized. | housekeeping twice forgot to provide turn-down service, and room service took a full 40 minutes for breakfast delivery. | moreover, the charming, art deco ambiance is long gone, replaced by a hotel monaco kitschy-looking orange lobby. | once worth the splurge, the dorchester is one of the poorest values in london where one feels like an imposition rather than a welcome guest.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''check in was the worst i have ever experienced,the staff was so arrogant and unpleasant...the hotel is filled with people from the middle east and russians, so if you do not fit in this category you are not considered at all and the atmosphere in the lobby is somehow unpleasant..we had booked a deluxe category , the room we were shown was so small and dark that we asked to change and we finally were given a room of a more decent size, the carpet had just been changed so there was a strong smell. we had to call three times housekeeping in order to get an extra duvet, it took just under an hour to have it brought to our room. | next morning breakfast was a disgrace, the scrambled eggs were cold , the service was sloppy.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''things did not start well, had to queue to check in (not the hotels fault as we all seemed to descend at the same time), however this seemed to because front of house to go into complete meltdown. on finally checking in there were two rooms assigned to me, which was incorrect but because of the chaos the member of staff could not contact central reservations to see where the mix up occurred with plenty of dark mutterings of potential cancellation charges clearly implying the mistake must be mine and for which i would have to pay. then worst was to come, i had booked a dinner and stay package and was then informed there was no table available in any of the restaurants until really late that evening quite a problem as i had already paid for it! i was contacted before my stay several times by the savoy to ask for my guests name and time of arrival (not that that made the slightest difference on check in) but not warned that the restaurants were filling fast - all very odd. the best they could offer me was to be put on a waiting list, so the sole late table was secured with the hope of an earlier one becoming available. | we were offered no help with our bags and not shown to the room (completely different experience from when i stayed previously when the luggage was whisked away and we were taken to the room). i was also now beginning to become worried that maybe i had inadvertently booked two rooms, i double checked my emails and also tried to contact the booking agent to confirm, it seemed to me that it must be their mistake but with the threat of a large cancellation charge ringing in my ears i thought i would try contacting central reservations to see if i could sort out the issue, where check in had failed. the fear of a large unnecessary bill galvanising me into action. | to his credit the assistant director of rooms contacted me almost immediately and was extremely polite and helpful (weird how check in could not manage that task but i could), he explained that he was unhappy with my experience so far, that the room mix up was indeed their fault as they placed the booking twice on the system and even managed to secure a table earlier (6pm with a time limit when the table needed to be returned, not great - but in this situation i decided beggars could not be choosy). he seemed genuinely surprised that no help was offered with our bags and tried to assure me this was not their expected standard of service. he confirmed i would not be charged for the second room (weight off my mind) and even kindly sent a bottle of house champagne to the room. i would, of course, rather the whole stressful experience had not happened, but it was a nice gesture. i was then hopeful the experience would improve. unfortunately this was not the case - turned up at 6 to the restaurant, shown to an odd little table and despite the waiter in the restaurant being a very nice chap, there was a mix up over drinks and wrong menus presented then taken away etc, all a bit of a disaster. on a positive note the food was good. | went back to the room, thinking nothing more could possibly further happen to make this stay more miserable only to be awoken by, i believe, a delivery, at around 4am in the morning as my room overlooked the loading bay for the hotel. i had checked on check in that the room was quiet as i am quite a light sleeper, the lady confirmed it was! so did not even manage a full nights sleep. at breakfast, true to form, there was a minor mix up with the order. on check out i explained about the noise and there was a note made, but heard nothing more. the assistant director of rooms had also sent me a further email offering an upgrade next time i stayed, however i am not sure i would want to put myself through the whole miserable, unpleasant and stressful experience again. i have previously stayed at the savoy and was looking forward to this pre-christmas break, unfortunately standards have slipped alarmingly.'''",0

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''i stayed here recently for two nights on a business trip. i arrived early but fortunately was given a room straight away. although called london wall, it is actually down a side street and the taxi driver had no idea where it was. | the room itself was very small with not much room to walk around in - if there had been anyone staying with me it would have been too small. i was on the 1st floor looking onto other rooms with no view apart from a large air conditioning unit and cigarette butts. the bed was comfortable and i did sleep well. | although the room was clean generally, without going into too much detail, there was a nasty stain on what was left of the toilet paper - very off putting. | i was asked on check in if i would like a wake up call and newspaper - i requested both for both days and only got the wake up call on the first morning, and no newspapers. | the service at breakfast on the first day was good, although i was given the wrong menu to start with. the second day i was given the wrong menu again and was also presented with something i had not ordered. the food itself was good. | on check out i pointed out that i did not receive a newspaper and one of my wake up calls and the receptionist really did not seem bothered. | overall, the service was worse than what you would expect in a budget hotel and i really think the hotel is trying too hard with some things - like huge tv's in the bedroom (which only show freeview plus a few foreign channels) and flowery cushions in the rooms - and not spending enough time on the things that really matter.'''",0

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''on 20th december 2012 had lunch at the massimo restaurant. to summarise our waitress had extremely greasy hair and was not very welcoming. the set menu worked out more expensive for two courses which the waitress failed to give us an adequate explanation other than it was to do with portion size??? | we ordered earl grey tea for two served by a different waitress who completely dismissed my request to allow my tea to brew a little while longer and continued to pour a weak tea. the tea pot did not contain any tea leaves and the tea was a very pale yellow. after having our tea changed by a waiter , it reappeared exactly the same. third time lucky we hoped! this time we requested a tea bag. only one tea bag was given. after all the fuss the identity of the tea was finally discovered after several minutes to be jasmine tea. hence 5 star or not!!! one tea bag charged at 11 and to top it all off the wrong one! | we felt disrespected to a point that we were so upset i would have lost my cool if i had complained to a manager. in all honesty i just wanted to leave and felt saddened by how bad service was. we paid and left. | on the same evening i experienced a complete 5 star experience at a different restaurant in a different hotel which made me realise that corinthia hotel really needs feedback. not surprised massimo seemed quiet in comparison.'''",0
The Savoy,'''great renovation of this london landmark. you really want to like it but pretty much everything is broken. any request involving more than one person never materializes. | my shower was 6 drops of water per second and about 300 degrees. the tv decided when it had had enough and shut itself whenever it did not like what i was watching. the staff are extraordinarily kind but hapless. the wi fi is surreal - i will leave it there. at + 500 gbp per night it is a waste of time and an exercise in frustration.''',0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''fairly disappointed with my recent stay at the mondrian london for the following reasons: | 1. the layout of the room is odd with plenty of unusable space making it difficult to lay out two luggages. | 2. the room feels smaller than a 29 sqm room, due to a large mini bar and an oddly-positioned airconditioning system. | 3. the room had poor sound-proofing and i could hear adjoining rooms opening and closing their doors. | 4. the bathroom design causes water to go everywhere when showering and the rain shower had very low pressure. | 5. the bedsheets were very rough and there was no options for firmer pillows. | however, the gym at the mondrian is well-equipped and service in general was excellent. this is not a terrible facility but honestly not the luxurious hotel it is touted to be.'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i stayed at this hotel for one night during a recent business trip. i stay in london 2 or 3 times each year and stay at a different hotel on each occasion. i have also stayed at several mandarin properties before and found them to be excellent, this one however is not. | the room was a standard room, and that is the best description one could give for it. the television cabinet has a huge television but below where there appears once to have been a video now only has a view of a pile of cables. when sitting in your bed this is what you look at. | in the bathroom housekeeping and maintenance was very poor. the shower head had not been descaled and neither had the marble tiles around the bath. the grouting was missing in many places and the paintwork was badly chipped. | as for the service this was generally ok, but the complimentary coffee never arrived and when coming back to the hotel was greeted by a delegation of security people. i walked over to the lift that was at the ground floor only to be told to use another lift by two hotel staff who obviously were holding it for someone more important than me! | however my patience for this overpriced hotel ran out when charged 27 for a sandwhich and a diet coke. the coke was 6. i accept that you have to pay a premium for london hotels but this kind of pricing leaves you with a very sick feeling of being ripped off. | with breakfast and parking, one nights acoomodation came to 450. i wanted to enjoy this hotel, but left feeling that there are better hotels, with friendlier staff, better maintained rooms and overall enjoyment for less in london.'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we have stayed twice before at sussex gardens, but this placed was the worst of all of our stays. first of when we arrived we were directed to another building where our rooms were, and had to walk back to the first one for breakfast. the rooms which he said were side by side, were a floor apart - my sister and me literally stayed in the basement. both rooms were so small that an open trolley could not fit onto the floor. we had no windows in our room, and had it not been for the aircon we would not get any fresh air in at all - which by the way gave me the worst cold i had for over a year. my sister and me had to share a rather small bed and down, and had to crawl over each other to leave the bed - and the pillows were made of cement. the toilet had no room for toiletries, and only boiling hot water to shower in. the faucet by the sink had only two functions, sloppy spray or full force spray of water. only good thing was clean towels everyday. | the wifi did not get through sometimes because we were in the basement, and overall we stayed in a broomcloset with no windows. the breakfast which were included, were to say the least, uninspiring. the waitress seemed preoccupied with talking to the other waitress, and if we wanted eggs and bacon, we had to pay extra! i miss to see the point in an continental breakfast, which we already paid for, that we had to pay more to get what we had paid for to begin with. | the other places it were included, and we could eat as much as we wanted. | i am bitter over the experience, as we paid quite a bit to stay only three nights, and this was the experience we had. we are not coming back to this place, and i would say to others, to pick something else.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''having enjoyed afternoon tea several times at the savoy prior to its refurbishment i was looking forward to returning to see all the work and enjoy tea once more. unfortunately the service has gone drastically down hill since the refurbishment. the tea was nice enough but still not as good as others i have had. the main complaint was our waiter who was too busy chatting to his colleagues or other customers and not ensuring all his customers were served. we waited over an hour for our pastries to be served and had cold tea served at one point! not good at all. go elsewhere for afternoon tea - lanesborough, landmark or claridges are all far better.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''it really pains me to have to write this review since we have grown to love fairmont hotels and have been loyal guests since several years ago. we have been trying to maintain our fairmont president's club premier tier membership for a while now, but i having serious doubt about whether or not it is worth continuing with the rapid degradation in the service it provides while the cost of staying at fairmont hotels continues to hike. | for this stay, we called the fairmont president club member reservation assistance line to book the four night getaway to use our ""complimentary room upgrade"" that we got for being premier tier members, and we are not aware of any packages whatsoever as the booking was handled by the agent on the phone. please note that none of the other ""perks"" are applicable to the savoy such as third night free. | i would like to mention that we were quite satisfied last time we stayed at this hotel almost exactly a year ago. last year, we booked a similar room category and upon arrival, we were offered to sit down to go through the check-in process. the person handled our check-in acknowledged that we have been long term fairmont guests, and that we are fairmont president's club premier tier members and offered us complimentary breakfast. | our experience this time was vastly different. we arrived at the hotel to check-in around 15:00. we made our way to the check-in area and were made to stand during the entire check-in process. we had been traveling and had heavy backpacks and other luggage with us at the time. the person who handled our check-in had no idea we stayed at the same hotel the year before and that we are fairmont president's club premiere tier members. nothing special was offered - not even daily newspaper. needless to say, this whole experience felt like checking into a holiday inn. towards the end of the check-in process, we met the customer relations manager jayne wilkinson who talked to us briefly and welcomed us to the hotel. | the room was quite okay. we had a partial river view room in the ""edwardian"" side of the hotel accessible via the ""oldest lift"" in london. there is nothing special about the ""luxury king"" room, however, for the price they charge. living space is standard and there is no dual vanity in the bathroom. there is not even a separate tub. the only window in the room offers partial river view and it is really quite small. overall, not impressed with the room and the technology or lack thereof makes the place feel rather dated. | onto the housekeeping, during our stay, housekeeping staff had never refilled any of the toiletries. on the second day of stay, i had to call housekeeping to request shower gel. we used some mouthwash that was supplied and it was not refilled either. we had to again call housekeeping to request a refill. we both felt this was odd for a fairmont hotel and simply unacceptable for any five star establishment - let along the iconic savoy palace. | all the other staff are great, however, from doormen to concierge. we had pleasant interactions with them and they were all extremely helpful and friendly. the night shift concierge in particular was incredibly helpful and fun to chat with! | another thing i would like to mention is that asking for a bottle of water or just a bucket of ice from the room service department costs five pounds. although the water and bucket of ice are complimentary, just to have them brought to your room costs you, which i thought was rather odd as i have never had to pay for room service to bring up some ice and i have stayed in a lot of upscale properties. | during our stay, it was apparent that the hotel was very understaffed. there is a lot of traffic through their lobby every day. it seemed to us that if you are not well-dressed you do not get any attention/greetings at all from the staff. we were pretty much invisible during our stay since we normally do not pack any fancy clothes while we go on month long vacation. perhaps it is normal for central london hotels? the lobby is usually filled with people in their fancy outfits. | we also voiced our concerns during our stay in regards to the check-in process and lack of any acknowledgement and courtesy to their long time fpc members whatsoever, and all we got was a bottle of champagne in our room with a note that says they are sorry. we did get an email from the customer relations manager jayne wilkinson after we departed to assure us that they will make our experience right next time with special offers, but unfortunately it is too little too late. we would have preferred if they tried to do something during our stay instead of after since we stayed there for almost a week. | all in all, this was a very disappointing display, and i am having doubts about maintaining my loyalty to fairmont hotels. there is a lot of history in the building itself and i get why people get excited when they stay in such a property, but it really is poor value for the money. | fairmont should take a hard look at some other membership benefits such as leader's club which offers complimentary room upgrades and breakfast for all bookings with a small annual fee which we really love. the membership pays for itself after just a stay or two. | it saddens me greatly to say this, but i would not recommend the savoy until fairmont get their act together. i have very high expectations for fairmont, and it really let me down this time.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,'''i went today for afternoon tea and there was a delay in our sitting which they apologised for but then they took 30 minutes to serve us! there were 7 of us and the 4 little tables were separated so it did not feel intimate. there was not a victoria sponge or bakewell tart even though it was on the menu. all the flavours were subtle sometimes too subtle except for the rhubarb jelly which had so much alcohol that it made you balk. it was a shame because the pictures on their website made the cakes look so amazing but i was disappointed and will not be going back or recommending to anyone. my friends all agreed that it was not as good as the other places they have been to. pity too because this is the first time i have been to afternoon tea and it was not as enjoyable as i had hoped''',0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we stayed at the mandarin oriental (mo) hyde park in early july 2012. we have been here before in summer 2010 when it was renovating and was not impressed, but decided to give it another chance anyway given its proximity to harrods (and we figured that the renovations are done by now). turns out, it was just as disappointing post renovation. indeed, are they sure they had any renovation work done at all? with the exception of a new livelier place for breakfast (in the form of the heston by blumenthal restaurant), everything looked the same. | the last time we arrived at the hotel by hotel car, the hotel staff greeted us at the reception and immediately took us to our room for in-room check-in (as most top hotels do). i was disappointed to note that no one was there to greet us this time, even though they were clearly not swamped (this is 7am in the morning! clearly they were just lazy!). we were further disappointed to note that our rooms were not only not connected, but not even on the same floor, even though we specifically requested it a few weeks ahead when we booked, and reiterated it before we arrived. i can tell that the staff did try their best to accommodate us, but you would think they can do better than that with 2 - 3 weeks notice! maybe they just need to use a better planning system. apparently if you want connecting rooms, you have to book 6 months ahead!! | we had 3 rooms at the hotel; one hyde park junior suite, one knightsbridge room and one regular double room. we booked under american express, so the hyde park junior suite and the knightsbridge room are supposed to be upgrades, but it did not really feel like it. i actually asked what the difference was, and apparently they size is the same, but the bonus was in the view, which is a peaceful view of the hyde park greenery. being city people and avid shoppers, we actually prefer the more vibrant view of harvey nichols. the suite itself was a slightly larger version of regular rooms. if we did not know better wed have thought that this was the knightsbridge room. we could not really tell the difference between the knightsbridge room and the regular room. the rooms itself looked exactly the same as it did pre-renovation, very old british/ victorian. i guess they are trying to preserve the identity of the hotel? to me, that means old and stuffy, with small nods to modern luxuries. to be fair, they did have a b&amp;o flat screen and a modern touch screen telephone. but the overall dcor of the room just felt very rundown and shabby (i.e. the front door looked really well-worn and scratched). the biggest problem i had though was the bathroom, which is poorly designed with bad plumbing. the shower is part of the tub. except the tub does not have any curtains, but a paltry glass partition that covers maybe 1/3 of the length of the tub. so you can imagine what a challenge it is to shower without getting water all over the place. there is a rain shower and a mobile shower head option. except there is no place to hold the mobile shower head while you are washing yourself down. so you either freeze while you wash, or you opt to get dunked from overhead. the shower head itself was also weak. and many a times, i worried that the drain was not working! these are just not the type of concerns one should have at a five star hotel, paying 800+ pounds per night! i was not the only one complaining about the un-impressiveness of our room. while i was checking out, i noticed the secretary of a vvip back in my hometown complaining about their suites, and heard the staff tell them that it was already an upgrade blah blah blah. at least they treat everyone the same? | we were also frustrated that even as guests of the hotel, we were unable to get a reservation at the heston by blumenthal restaurant, even though wed tried booking 2 weeks ahead and were waitlisted, and had followed up with the front desk and the restaurant several times before that. i am sure even the ritz london reserves places for afternoon tea for their in house guests in lieu of requiring them to make reservations 3 month in advance. indeed, i was talking to staff at the mo paris, and they too save a few seats for in-house guests at their popular sur mesure restaurant. | speaking of which, mo paris is far far superior to mo london both in terms of quality of service and the hotel. let us just focus on the service, since it is not the hotel staffs fault that their rooms are old and stuffy. i asked mo london whether they can waive our internet charge. seriously, i do not even know why hotels still charge you for internet. internet connection is such an essential of daily life it is like charging you for channels on the tv. you would think it should be included considering the price were paying per night (take back the nespresso machine!). but i guess they try to make money off you wherever they can. anyway, their answer was no. upon further inquiry the answer was still no. apparently, it is a company policy amongst all mo hotels. well, my dear staffs of mo london, the reception at mo paris waived my internet charge without me even asking! what do you have to say for yourself? it is not about the money, but about hospitality and making the guest feel special. that is what the business is all about! i mean over all, the staff was polite and helpful (as they should be). but i felt that they were too rigid, and did not really go the extra mile to make you feel at home. i.e. the doorman only occasionally came out with an umbrella to shade you from the rain as you get out of the car. no one even helped me with my many bags when i came back from a shopping trip. in comparison, the staff at mo paris recognized us from our last visit, and was the epitome of hospitality. i have also been to mo geneva, and the service there was impeccable as well. they should really do an exchange program or something, so the staff can learn from each other to ensure a consistent good quality in all their hotels. mo london, you can do better!'''",0

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i hate it when hotels make me write reviews like this. on the surface this is a great little hotel with a lovely design, perfectly comfortable rooms, well-appointed bathrooms and great amenities. it has a convenient location and all-in-all was really a nice little base for us. yes, it is small but it is a victorian hotel and comparable with any of the other hotels in the area, that is not an issue. | the reason i will not be back is that this charming little boutique hotel happens to be one of the most ungenerous and stingy properties i have come across (for the price). we paid for an executive room which includes ""bottled water, evening refreshments and drinks"". what we did not know was that evening refreshments and drinks were limited to one drink per person and a few dodgy dry sandwiches served by some of london's unfriendliest bar tenders. we also did not know that the water was only free on the first night. so you can imagine our surprise when we were charged for subsequent bottles - and a second round of drinks we had one night. | you may say i am being petty, but if the services included in the room rate are only provided on the ""first night"" or limited then surely i should only have to pay executive room rates for the first night and reduced rates each day thereafter? it makes just as little sense. you either have a product offering that is generous and matches the expectations advertised (and charged for) or you do not. there is too much competition in london for hotels at similar prices who offer more. | and a final note, although we did have a room with a gorgeous juliette balcony, the housekeeper kept leaving the balcony door unlocked every day, meaning that anyone could have entered the room and helped themselves to our stuff. | room type: executive room'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we stayed at the rhodes hotel while traveling to the uk for a family wedding. i did do quite a bit of research and was not surprised by some of the issues we had during our stay. we expected steps and no elevator just by reading other reviews. others who traveled said that the staff assisted them with their luggage so the steps were not a problem. this was not the case during our stay. the man who checked us in offered to help us to our room which we graciously accepted. he then proceeded to walk in front of us on the stairs carrying nothing but our key while i made four trips to the fourth floor carrying my families luggage. by assistance he meant opening the room door for us when we got to it. | the room was sufficient for my family . we expected a small sized room due to already having lowered our expectations after talking to friends who had traveled to london. we stayed in the quad room and initially had a problem with the tv. the staff did respond right away and fix the tv. i did have an opportunity to speak with mr. crias, the owner, who was very knowledgeable about the city. he did say that he caters the hotel more toward families because other hotels do not allow them. on our last night, a large group of teens arrived at the hotel. they ran up and down the steps yelling until around 3am. | when we finished packing to leave in the early morning hours, i noticed that the strap for my luggage($8 cost) was missing. we searched the room and our luggage but did not locate it. at our next destination in scotland we again searched our belongings but did not find it. i then spoke with family members who had stayed at the same hotel while we were there. my mother reported missing small amounts of money that she had set aside for her grandchildren. she knew the exact amounts because they were supposed to be a gift. she noticed on the night before we checked out that the larger coin denominations (ie. 2 pound, pound, 50 pent) were gone but the small change was left. | it appears that the cleaning staff may have sticky fingers as they appear to steal small items. this is probably because most incidents would go unreported. | all in all i would not recommend this hotel. i realize the missing items were small but when i stay at a hotel, i expect to have nothing stolen. fortunately london offered various activities that kept us busy during our stay and helped us not think about any of the issues at the hotel.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''we were told in a very rude manner by the staff that we could not have a cup of tea and a snack that we had bought from harrods cafe in the lobby. the hotel had a very separate dining area with tables that was separated from the main lobby by a set of doors which we were nowhere near. we were sitting by a window in the corner of the lobby. the only reason we brought our food back to the hotel is because we could not find anywhere to sit in harrods or anywhere to sit in between, every place was packed with tourists as is usual for a saturday during summer holidays in london. | while we were outside our 5 year old got stung by a wasp. we thought we would retreat back to what should have been the safety and comfort of the hotel we paid for but instead were rudely asked by staff if we had a room there and when we said yes, we are guests, we were rudely told that we cannot eat in the lobby and that if we had to eat we would have to do so in our room. the same room our boys had spent all morning cooped up in with their babysitter because we had to attend a wedding ceremony that did not allow children that day. they needed a break and we took them out but then could not find a place to sit and eat our snack so we assumed we would be safe in the hotel lobby we paid for, and this hotel is quite expensive for what it is as well. | by the way there were absolutely no signs anywhere in the lobby stating that guests cannot eat in the lobby (keeping in mind it was not a five course meal - it was tea and pastries.) as we were heading up to our room, a little confused and embarrassed from having been evicted from our own lobby, we pointed out that there were no signs up stating guests cannot eat or drink in the lobby ...this ended up with the staff shrugging and giving us rude looks and stating that no hotel lobby would allow guests to eat in their lobby. | i believe if the hotel has not put the lobby seating and tables in for guest use they should probably just take these options for guest ""comfort"" out because really guests are not made to feel comfortable in the lobby anyway. at the very least put a sign up stating clearly that guests cannot eat or drink in the lobby. our children were sitting very quietly, the lobby was empty aside from staff at the desk and one staff member lingering around to glare at us and it was a very disappointing situation for us to have been asked to move remove our entire family (two children 5 and 3) over such a silly rule that was not signposted anyway. | the reason we gave this hotel a ""poor"" instead of a ""terrible"" rating was because the location is quite convenient but this hotel is expensive for what it is, our room was cramped and had a funny smell, especially the bathroom and the staff who handled this lobby ""issue"" were incredibly rude and condescending. very sad to give such a review as we do not normally do this kind of thing.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i did not like the customer service. there is a sense of not being genuinely interested in helping guests but just making sure you pay and keeping up the profit levels. service at ""the american bar"" was really poor with staff just playing dumb when it was explained to them that wifi was not available to conduct business - one has to go through a complex sign up process and pay money. really, no easily accessible wifi in a bar where so many people are conducting business. the staff were very rude about not being interested in this. staff do not smile genuinely and act as if they own the bar, being very bossy ( "" sit here, have this, do this""). the menu lacks variety. prices are very high. where is the excellent customer service? i advise business people to conduct business elsewhere.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed at this hotel for a week in july with my daughter. this hotel must be rated / expensive because of its location. although i was expecting the room to be small i was not expecting it to be 4 star with no ac and just generally shabby. we had a fairly hectic agenda so were not in the hotel for most of the day but after sweating in bed for 3 nights i had to complain on the front desk. they told me in a rather snooty tone that i was not the only one in a room that had not been renovated ( comforting to know??) and that there was a table fan. the night shift manager was more accommodating and said that i could change my room to a renovated room that did have ac. we did move room and that was a 100% better. my sisters were also booking into the hotel so i pre-warned them to ask for a renovated room, which they consequently insisted on at check in. their room was even better than mine and with what appeared to be a jacuzzi bath. ( however they later discovered this did not work). breakfast was very average, they appeared to run out of fresh fruit quickly and everything else was mediocre. a lot of the staff did not speak proper english and were hard to understand. the location of this hotel is great, tube very close and lots of nice restaurants.'''",0

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''at 500gpb per night i just expected more. yes the hotel oozes luxury and charm. yes the staff are (generally) attentive to your every whim. yes the spa is spectacular if you have the time to indulge. | but why am i marking it down? 2 reasons, which would not have bothered me in a hotel that was not claiming the corinthia's level of excellence. | 1: air conditioning performance in room | i stay in many hotel rooms and this is the first where the controls have defeated me and the staff, and which was unable to be rectified. during the first night we set the temp to 22 deg, on auto. it just continued to blow and blow and blow cold air, directly onto the bed - making the room unpleasantly cold but unfortunately not cold enough to overcome the heat being generated by a doona that was better suited to extreme arctic conditions. turning the a/c off allowed the room to quickly overheat. and it had a mind of its own about coming on and off, regardless of whether turned on or off. | i spoke to the staff the next day about this, who advised me that evening that the engineers had checked it out and confirmed all was ok. alas this was not to be the case, as we faced a second night with the same problem (although we had the doona replaced with a cotton blanket). the hotel sent up a member of staff to check on the problem, and after going through it with us he agreed the 'auto' control was not working, most likely because the thermostat was located away from the vent of the bed, in a part of the room that was warmer, and which would never cool. hence the thermostat or would never reach our desired temperature, while we slowly froze. another hot night without a/c. by this time we gave up and resigned ourselves to our fate on subsequent nights. | 2: breakfast quality, seating, attention and availability | the quality of breakfast is not as good as that enjoyed at most 4 star hotels, let alone 5 star or luxury. one type of eggs (scrambled), very very limited range of cold meats/fish and breads, and all in tiny serves. (and in case management read this and suggest we could have ordered from the menu, my response would be that we found that too confusing - could we order from the menu while choosing from the buffet as a supplement, or was it one or the other. the menu, which is the size of a broadsheet, is too complex) | the staff had perfected the art of looking but not seeing, hence once seated it became very difficulty, for example, to order a coffee. staff walked by us repeatedly without us being able to attract their attention. and when we were able to place a coffee order it took an interminable amount of time, and on two different meal occasions having to ask at least twice. | if you do have breakfast there, avoid sitting on the lounge/bench seats. for some reason in recent years a feature of design has been seating which is too low for, and too far from, the tables. select the individual seats if you prefer comfort. | and finally, having an early check out on sunday morning i thought i would get down to breakfast early, and was quite surprised to find they did not start serving breakfast till 7, later than other days. granted some people may sleep in, but i was disappointed to find a luxury hotel who could not cater to people who left early no matter what day. yes i could have ordered room service, but it never entered my mind that they might open later. mea culpa. | as i said at the start, i could put up with these things in a hotel of a lesser standard at a cheaper price, but the corinthia should not miss the mark on these levels of comfort'''",0
The Savoy,"'''went for early evening drinks, and were told to wait for a table in a corridor!! after watching 2 couples be seated immediately, decided in this vast city full of wonderful bars and restaurants, nobody should cue for a glass of champagne. get over yourself, the savoy, and teach communication and customare care to your staff!'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''my husband and i stayed here for 3 nights in an executive king room. the paid for a bigger room because we were concerned about space and we were disappointed. the room would have been big enough if they had not placed a small table &amp; 2 chairs at the foot of the bed, that just are not required. | the service was appalling. the first morning at breakfast, my husband had to chase several staff for some coffee, it is like we were invisible. | and on our last morning (check out is by 12), housekeeping knocked on our door at 8.30am! and when i expressed my annoyance, her response was that they have no communication with the front desk so they do not know whose left and whose has not! is this not a basic facility at most hotels, especially what we would consider to be an expensive one! housekeeping knocked again at 10am, and when i expressed my annoyance telling her she is the second person this morning and it is ridiculous, she responds with ""well, it is only my first time and if you do not want us knocking you should put the do not disturb sign up"". | when we checked out, the receptionist asked if we had enjoyed our stay, i replied with not at all actually, it is been terrible and she just looked down at her computer and ignored my comments. | it is an expensive hotel with terrible staff, we were extremely disappointed and would never stay there again. | the location was good, but in the evening, when walking back to our hotel, the streets are full with groups of arab men and if i had not been with my husband, i would not have felt safe.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''after checking in we tried to go up to the room, here we had to change our first key card as it would not work in the lift, this card then did not work when we got to the room, when we finally got into the room it was lovely. we went down to the bar which had approximately 6/8 tables of primarily couples at them, we waited for about 15/20 minutes before someone even came over &amp; took our order, we saw 3 waiters, two men &amp; one woman plus two male bar staff but they all seemed to be pre-occupied all of the time. the drinks which were a prosecco &amp; mojito took nearly 15 minutes to arrive. at this time, we decided that we had better order our sharing patter as the drinks took so long, this took 30 minutes to arrive &amp; after another 10 minutes i had to ask where the second glass of prosecco was, which finally turned up. it then got very busy with a large party gathering by the door, after approximately 15 minutes a lady asked the waiter when they were going to get served, he replied that they were very busy &amp; he would get to her when he could. i would hate to think when this party got their drinks, we left to go back to the room, upon reaching the door, the key card did not work again so my husband went back down to the foyer, where he was told quite abruptly that we must not put the card anywhere near a phone or credit card, this card did actually work, i have stayed in lesser quality hotels where this has not been a problem. | we arrived back to the hotel later that evening &amp; went to bed, we were rudely awoken at 8.30am by the cleaner opening the door sticking her head in &amp; then going back out again. the service &amp; availability of the breakfast was good &amp; we enjoyed it, upon going back to the room we sat watching tv when at 10.30 there was a knock at the door housekeeping she stood there &amp; quite rudely asked what time we were leaving when i said that check out was not until noon she turned away. the room itself was excellent &amp; the amenities available were excellent although we did not use the spa or pool but there were there if we had wanted to, it was just the lack of service that has really left us disappointed. | when we went to check out the staff did not ask how our stay was, in hindsight i can see why as it would have been embarrassing having to listen to the list that i had, i shall not be recommending this hotel to anyone.'''",0
The Savoy,'''i was kept awake by staff shouting at each other in an office close to my room and the piano music from the bar - i mentioned this to a waiter and it was reported to reception but the offer of a change of room arrived too late to make use of it. however the following night was much quieter. when booking i was offered the option of having breakfast at simpson's. this involved a walk out of the hotel and down the the strand in the rain; check you are having breakfast inside the hotel as this was not made clear to me. a cheap carton of milk was provided in the fridge and the coffee making facilities were clumsy and crass - no tray or biscuits. the whole experience lacked finesse and i left feeling disappointed''',0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i have stayed in many hotels but never have i experienced such a stressful stay as this one. shower tap was not working properly and i had to call the reception every time before using it. there s no lift service in this hotel so if your room is on 4th floor, then you are doomed. location is perfect but hotel itself is one of the worst i have ever been to. also the cleaning staff is not well trained. they talk very loudly in the morning so if you are expecting to have a peaceful sleep, then goodluck'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i booked into this hotel for my daughters wedding as we had hired the ballroom for the occasion. it took ten emails to book a room for two nights as each reply came from a different person. nothing had been passed on to the next person. there was no space for letting down outside the main entrance and difficulty in making someone understand i needed help with the luggage. in spite of having my card details they insisted in taking more details which took another 25 minutes. when i checked i had been charged in advance of staying. no other hotel does this. i think the service the poorest in london and i live in london. i would not recommend anyone staying here, just pop in for the restaurant which does not belong to the mandarin oriental as it is sub let to heston blumental. that is why the restaurant is good not like the hotel.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''our family have stayed in many hotels around the world and we have never experienced such terrible staff morale and culture. on arrival, reception did not greet us at all. they gave us a blank stare without any frendliness or politeness. during breakfast senior staff raised their voices and waved their arms around at their staff, whilst guest were present. the concierge staff never in our 10 day stay welcomed our family, spoke to us or smiled. senior management refused to speak to us regarding clarification about a small issue. they finally after numerous requests came to speak to us, one with a cup of coffee in her hand and the other on her phone. very professional! my husband and l were spoken to rudely and inapproprietely in front of our children and other guests. we were in such disbelief. the accoustics are terrible, doors banging, toilets flushing and people snoring. we never had a good nights sleep. the hotel allowed renovations and painting to start early hours in the morning. trademan laughing, banging and smoking. | the only good thing about this hotel is its location and renovated spacious rooms. that is it!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i have stayed at the rembrandt multiple times over the past few years. unfortunately, i have seen declining service at the property with each stay. stayed 3 nights in june in an executive king. i agree with other reviews on the cleanliness (bathroom issues) and sound/noise issues, housekeeping. other technical problems i experienced -- the air conditioner was not working (miserable during a heat wave) and the internet data port needed repair. giving multiple reports of these issues to reception was met with a smile and reponse that they will check into it...but nothing was done. | although the room is a good size for london, and the kensington location is great, the overall hotel experience is not good for the value. other kensington properties such as the capital offer far more.'''",0
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''i used to be a regular visitor until i was denied a refund, partial credit nor an upgrade towards a next visit because of an unexpected surgery even though i provided the necessary documents they asked for ! very unprofessional way of treating an old client especially when most of the staff was already known to me. i will not return.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,'''arrived to the hotel yesterday and have noticed that in-room temperature can not be raised more than 21 c and the ventilation itself is noisy. called reception and they have promised to send someone to fix it. no one came on the next day and currently the a/c system stopped working completely.''',0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed here last weekend for 2 nights while visiting the london boat show - and while i agree that the location is great - the hotel was a big disappointment. on a positive note, the staff were very wecoming and efficient - and there were lots of them. the rooms were big and old fashioned and the bathrooms were a monument to marble! my biggest gripe is the bar... a tiny space which has been redesigned in new muted browns, beige, creams with lots of opaque glass - quite out of keeping with the hotel - but it was tiny! on both nights we failed to get a seat, despite standing at the bar for nearly an hour and eventually left to find a drink elsewhere. come on mandarin - look after your guests. i will not be back - take my advice and try one aldwych instead - the bar is brillant and not a piece of marble in sight!'''",0
The Rembrandt,'''i am extremely angry and upset with the service. i wanted to treat my husband to a romantic weekend for his birthday. i booked a grand room and asked for a jacuzzi bath when i booked the room. i was advised there was a room available. on arrival we were told our room was not ready and the previous occupier had asked for a late checkout. we went out and came back and was then told they had no grand rooms left with jacuzzi bath and downgraded us to a smaller room. this hotel ruined my weekend and my present to my husband. i will never stay here again or recommend to anyone.''',0

The Rembrandt,'''stayed in the rembrandt in sept of 03. weather was unseasonably warm and beautiful and my room had no a/c-although they provided a standing fan (can you believe it?). in addition to this my room was on the sunny side of the street which would heat the room! i think that some rooms have ac and others do not b/c my travel partner had a/c! | the breakfast was less than mediocre so i would suggest a local mcdonalds instead! the proximity to shopping is the only thing that that this hotel can offer! try another!''',0
The Rembrandt,"'''you would expect a hotel in knightsbridge to be of a high standard but we experienced rooms that smell, poor quality paint work and very old fashioned decor. good location but that is all. do not pay more for wi-fi, it is free but not advertised and the spa if free at weekends and we were informed after paying.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''from the poor service in the restaurant, the fact that you have to pay extra to use the gym or the pool. they had construction going on but did not tell you. the surly attitude of the bar staff in the fluorescent lighted bar area. | no one that works here gives a damn about the customer.'''",0

Rhodes Hotel,"'''a little surprised to read so many positive reviews for the rhodes hotel. on the plus side both my bedroom and bathroom were clean, bed was comfortable and the breakfast was simple/adequate. location of the hotel was good. | however, my room was close to the top of the hotel with no lift. the stairs were narrow and desperately in need of an upgrade. security inside the bedroom was a real issue, with no chain or secondary lock being present. i would suggest any female staying on their own might feel a little uncomfortable. | the breakfast room was situated in the basement which concerned me with regard to fire safety. one minor point, which was disappointing, was that not one person said ""good morning"" and the only english word spoken directly to me in 20-minutes was ""coffee?"" | overall the hotel served a purpose but to be honest, i expected better.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''my brother booked a night in the savoy for my mum and i after we saw miss saigon in london. we were naturally very excited. | even though the shower head was caked in limescale and needed a good clean, i liked the bathroom and the space it allowed. | the room was well presented and the sort of room you would expect in london...small. or should that be bijoux? | the main thing i had an issue with was the wind. unfortunately, we ended up in a room with windows that let in the wind so much that at first i thought a child next door must have had a recorder. if only! a child would have at least stopped, but the whistling in our room continued all night. wind: 1, sleep: 0. | lack of sleep meant i was craving coffee when the morning came. haunted by the whistling, i searched for the tea and coffee making facilities. is not it amazing that a hotel of the savoy's standing does not provide free tea or coffee making facilities unless you ask? but do not worry because when you do ask, you then get nescafe...at the savoy!! (or you can pay 7 for a cup to be delivered to your room.) | all is not lost though, because you can get coffee at breakfast, but do be prepared to sit close enough to bump elbows with the tables on either side and eavesdrop on some very uncomfortable conversations. i say eavesdrop, but if you can tune out a conversation that is happening less than 6 inches from you, i doff my cap. | rather than spend all that money on branding pointless items such as sugar sachets and toilet roll stickers, perhaps the savoy should reinvest and come into the present day - there is no free wifi and even their ipod docks are outdated with the connection for the 4 with no adaptor for a 5 or 6. | go to the savoy if you want to shout about the name while waving sad packets of branded sugar at your friends in a sleepless frenzy, but stay in somewhere cheaper like tune hotels for a similar sized room and a lot less money. i am off for a nap.'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''what a pity! i booked for a late arrival. waited at the door for ages. finally a man emerged half asleep. i was given my key. told the wrong floor(he was asleep still obviously). the room numbers are random and do not follow a normal pattern. room adequate. shower fine. cleanliness ok. continental breakfast was a laugh. i asked for coffee. 'filter?' i said. 'no'. was the woman's instant grumpy reply. 'i will have tea. english breakfast with milk, please.' she looked up from her telephone. 'no water?'' i was gobsmacked. then i realised she was perhaps thinking of chai. so instead i ensured that i watched her boil the water, use a tea bag and then give me a jug of milk. so continental breakfast is - instant coffee or tea with two pieces of white toast and apricot jam. the young man at the reception who accepted my key did smile though. perhaps he saw the joke of it all.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''it looks five or even six stars but the place and sadly the staff were without spirit. first impression was amazing but what we discovered behind the curtain was a huge disappointment. we decided to stay overnight and also had an afternoon tea which they claim to be one of the best in town. we were ignored all the time by everyone. there were just very few staff who had no idea what was going on. stressed, rushing and frustrated...i feel bad by writing such a bad review but just wanted to warn the others who plan to spend their hardly earned money for such a ""treat"". | there is something wrong how the place is run. it is not my priviledge to judge these poor guys anyway. however the selection was very good and the only down were sandwiches. it`s a shame because the place is beautifuly designed and has a great potential.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''this was a two night, wedding anniversary ""escape"" for my wife and i. good start on friday evening - help with the bags and a pleasant, cosy (though quite small) room with an attractive bathroom. check-in was efficient, though lacking in any warmth or welcome. | first problem was a lack of toiletries when i tried to have a shower - no shampoo; but not a biggie, so ok. however, things deteriorated after that: | saturday morning - no water. not just no hot water, no water at all. imagine - lavatory will not flush; cannot wash hands after using it - never mind lack of shower. deeply unpleasant and unacceptable. returned in the late afternoon - no letter of apology from the gm, nothing - but water back on (at noticeably reduced pressure from friday evening). out for dinner, back to bed - all fine. | sunday morning - no hot water. my wife, being more personal hygiene focused / braver (take your pick - possibly both!) had a cold shower - i demurred. to breakfast! had to wait in the lounge for our room number to called - unimpressive for a hotel with these pretensions (and prices). back to the room, having been assured categorically by the duty manager that there would be full water supply. nothing - not even cold water. checked out. no help with luggage, duty manager hiding, no offer of recompense. will not be back. | problems happen everywhere; they are generally impossible to hide in the hospitality industry which is hard for those who work in it. what is important is how businesses handle those problems - and the rembrandt could not be bothered to even try.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i spent valentine's day in one of your grand rooms. to be fair, the room was the best aspect of the visit, it was very big &amp; clean. we did not get a jacuzzi style bathtub even though i requested it, but i understand special requests cannot always be given to you, although i could have been told at reception. the espresso coffee machine is a nice touch but... only two capsules? barely any sugar? you would expect a lot more for the money you pay. another negative aspect is the spa. we went down looking for a relaxing time and we could not have felt more stressed. the lady at the reception made us wait for someone to show us the facilities. she could not grab hold of her colleague and felt bad we were left there waiting, so she just gave us directions, which were easy to follow. then, we got into the pool and the nightmare started - there was some sort of phlem/sick looking substance floating on the pool, which put us right off. when we moved to the other side of the pool, towards the jacuzzi bath which we wanted to use, we spotted a security tag/sticker from a bikini bottom. disgusting. we had to get out, as we were feeling extremely uncomfortable. we would have gone upstairs to lay down and try to relax and get dry - but there was no space (you need more seats/benches, as the spa was extremely quiet and there was still no room!) we told the lady at the reception and she was very apologetic. she was very nice and dealt with our issue promptly and professionally, which i appreciate. i know the spa is only adjacent to the hotel, but i felt i had to mention it. our day passes were refunded. | after dinner, we decided to go to the hotel bar for a couple of cocktails. the service was pretty average and the barman did not once smile or made us feel valued. when my boyfriend asked for an extra shot on our cocktails (to make it sweeter), he was unfriendly and almost seemed offended. not impressed at all. we were on our second round and would have probably spent a bit more money, but we felt like we were made to pay our bill &amp; did not feel comfortable, so we went up to the room. a shame &amp; missing opportunity. then, breakfast happened - i have visited many hotels but i have never experienced this before. they did not have enough space for everyone so you were put on a waiting list. there was only one guy taking care of it, constantly running up &amp; down and calling out room numbers. he was very friendly &amp; professional but could have done with a bit of help. when we finally got a table, nobody came over to us to offer tea or coffee. selection of food was limited and the quality average at best. i felt like they could have done with a few more members of staff helping out, although the ones i saw only seemed to be putting cups away and clearing tables, as opposed to serving anybody. the receptionists were nice though, during check-in and check-out. for a hotel this expensive, in this wonderful location, i would have expected a lot more. thoroughly disappointed.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my partner and i booked to stay at the mondrian for a long weekend. the hotel itself is ok nothing to write home about, although i must say staff are very attentive. however the spa was absolutely horrendous. i booked to have three treatments on the saturday and arrived about 2 hours early so i could enjoy the facilities. someone showed me around the spa and i chose to sit in the relaxation room, the main area of the spa. relaxing it was not, it was louder than the bar upstairs! to the left of me was a group of 5 women basically guffawing and talking over each other and to the left a couple who literally thought they were on a fashion shoot. at one point i had to ask them to not take a picture of me as they were taking them from every angle. to top it off it was absolutely freezing. i asked a member of staff if they could kindly ask the ladies to keep it down and maybe put the heating on to which she said she could neither. i ended up going back up to my room to wait for my treatments. spa staff were rude and unhelpful not at all what you would expect from a central london hotel spa and given it is around the same price as the bvlgari or corinthia spa it does not even touch them on quality. if you want to relax stay away! i ended up feeling more stressed when i left and 400 out of pocket'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i came here and was astounded at how beautiful the building and decor is. this certainly has the aesthetic of a 5 star hotel. however, i have never had such awful food in my life. i honestly am in disbelief that people could pretend to enjoy the flavorless, bland, and ostentatious dishes they prepare here (the venison carpaccio had the aftertaste of battery acid) when they cannot even make proper english muffins or a simple pancake without it coming out as a thick clot of flour. i absolutely could never recommend ordering this overpriced, aggressively overrated food to anyone. | the staff is very kind for the most part, but tends to make a lot of mistakes. for example, our room keys have worked on and off for the three days we have been here. i have had to change it in the lobby at least four times, twice in one day no less. i have been given food i did not order instead of the food that i did order (more than once). on new years eve we were told we would be need blue bracelets to re-enter this section of the city due to the crowds and firework preparations. they forgot to give us bracelets after they said they would bring them to our room, and the only reason we had them was because we went to the front desk and asked for them. staff members have contradicted each other on what floor facilities are on. | based solely upon location and looks, this place is 5 stars. however i have never been somewhere rated so highly and been so shocked at the underwhelming experience i have had for such an expensive price. i give it a solid 2 stars on experience.'''",0

City View Hotel,"'''i am not normally a moaner but this ""hotel"" is worth a moan. my husband and i booked this hotel for 1 night to attend the para athletics and it was perfect position for the park, about 15 mins walk. another positive - the bed was comfortable and clean and everywhere smelled clean. that is it., the rest is downhill all the way. | we were able to pay by card unlike previous reviewers and the girl on reception was friendly but had not a clue about the parking. the owner was on site and told us we could park on the public car park, which we did without any problem. | the double room was basic. there was a dirty fridge in the room, not quite sure why. a nice bedroom table would have been nicer. the refreshments were lacking. there was tea bags and sugar and 2 dirty cups. 1sachet of milk, no coffee. when we asked for more milk we were given a cup of milk but did not dare plug the fridge in to put it in . then we realised there were no spoons. my husband had not got the energy to walk down the 2 flights of stairs again. | there was sky but this did not work and no batteries in the remote control. reception had not got any either. the shelf was a hand made thing hanging off the wall. | the bathroom - little bars of soap, no shampoo. shower that showered the wall and the bottle of bleach on the floor well but not touching you. the toilet seat not the correct size so not fitting properly. the toilet rolls perched on the heated towel rail. | breakfast - we asked for everything on the menu and got everything in a way. not all at the same time and not for both of us. mug of tea with the tea bag and spoon still in. nowhere to put the tea bag. a bowl of milk with a few cornflakes in. did not dare ask for sauces. dirty cutlery on the table and in the sugar bowl. | luckily we did not pay expensive for the bed &amp; breakfast but fawlty towers definitely came into mind.'''",0
The Savoy,'''typical fairmont hotel. impressive public spaces but small rooms. some staff are friendly others ignore you. the bath is elevated so getting in and out of the shower would be difficult for elderly or less mobile people. when requesting a later check out they did a very unconvincing and disingenuous attempt. i had to request attention after 12 minutes of being seated for breakfast. ok hotel but expect better for the price.''',0
Newham Hotel,"'''this was the most dire hotel i have ever stayed in and i have travelled quite alot around the world! the staff were extremely rude, the room was like a closet and the supposed 'window' was in fact a barrier into the hosekeeping laundry room and therefore we had no air within the bedroom. added to the fact that it was probably the hottest weekend to date in london made the evening unbareable as we could not breath within the room. my partner had to have several showers throughout the night to try and cool down! to even access the shower, you had to open the bathroom door, step into the bedroom, open the shower and then go back into the bathroom - not dignified at all. topped with the floor tiles being broken into pieces and the toilet seat hanging off. i realise that this was always going to be a cheap &amp; cheerful hotel but the standards within that room were absolutely disgusting and when we raised this with the reception they simply smirked! i do not believe that this hotel should be advertised, never mind reccomended!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''our 3-night stay at the rembrandt was a bit disappointing. | disturbed by the guests next to our room due to poorly soundproved wall, we did not sleep well as they watched tv until midnight and set their tv timer to wake up at 5:45am! although we asked them to turn down the volume, we could still hear their tv distinctly. | at the checkout, the cashier charged my credit card directly in usd instead of pound using the hotel exchange rate (3% higher than the bank rate) without notifying me in advance. i noticed it afterwards on my way to the airport but it was too late. | their english breakfast is not worth spending your money. it only offers very limited variety of food. | for the price i paid, i will not stay there again.'''",0

Rhodes Hotel,"'''we had booked a quad room in the annex building, which turned out to be a very small room with four beds crammed into it. the owner herself said it was a triple room with an extra bed in it, leaving little room for four people's worth of luggage. the lack of space and storage room led to very cramped accommodation. the bathroom barely afforded standing room, and the door did not lock. the room had a tv with basic channels, a considerably old kettle, cups of questionable cleanliness, and tea and coffee. | the cleaning staff are lovely, though clearly overworked and underpaid. the owners did not appear to treat them with much respect while we were around, adding a sour note to the stay. | breakfast was fine, although in a dimly lit basement-style room where the staff are run off their feet. there was plenty of toast, spreads, cereal, fruit, cheese and ham to satisfy. | the location is the selling point for this hotel. barely a 5 minute walk to paddington station, you can easily catch a train anywhere in london. plenty of buses frequent the street, and the train station has a grocery store too. also walking distance to hyde park and kensington gardens. | all in all, the stay was tolerable, mostly because we did not spend much time in our room, but i would definitely not return, especially after seeing the owners' behaviour towards staff.'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''i attended my best friends wedding on 16th nov at the dorchester. although i had never been here before, i had heard so great about it from word of mouth but so wrong was i. as they say, the grass is greener on the other side, so true for the dorchester. we had dinner event for 350 guests and it was poorly organised. i had the misfortune of having a long table where half of my friends had been served the main course and we had to wait for almost 40 minutes for ours to arrive. when asking the waiters, few of them spoke bare english, and our waitress confirmed that the problem was in kitchen where the food had finished. initially we thought that they were joking but they were not. it just ruined our evening. when our main course (beef) came, it was cold and not upto 5 star standard. my girlfriend was supposed to have fish as ladies were having fish, but all our table was served beef. when questioned, the waiters did not respond and just left the food on the table expressionless. my other friends who were lucky to be served the food, were embarrassed to eat the food and were rather offering a portion from their plate to each other. no manageres were to be seen for help and we just felt left stranded. | i am surprised that this is how dorchester treats their guests. to tell you the truth, i was considering bringing my partner for an afternoon tea as i had never been there before, but now, i will never ever dare go there. oh no dorchester, you really ruined our experience. i work for a multinational company in ec1 and this is going to every one of my friends and colleagues in my company. no one should be lured of the hype of ""dorchester"". its nothing special and in fact their service and class is just an average one except the sky high prices. stop fooling people dorchester! never again !! shame on you!!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''as a local resident i have always recommended the hotel until today, shabby treatment at the hands of surly staff and a really uncomfortable bed with pillows made of rubberised iron later it probably makes sense to pay the extra money and stay somewhere genuinely smart. in fairness and perfectly nice breakfast the experience being completed by being told that my credit card did not work when their machine was broken'''",0

"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''this hotel has a really elegant lobby as well as pretty rooms and charming hallways. their staff is really pleasant and always willing to work hard to provide courteous service. however, if you are pregnant, have children, or just plain do not like the smell of smoke, do not stay here. there is a cigar bar adjacent to the lobby. it is impossible to stand in the lobby for more than a few seconds if you are sensitive to cigar smoke. the smell permeates everything on the lower level, the elevators, the hallways, and even the staff who show up to serve your room bring the smell in with them. in fact, my husband and i could smell the hotel from a few hotels away when approaching on the street. we mentioned it to the staff and considered moving to a room on a higher floor but decided to stick it out. we could only smell it in the room when room service came up but it was definitely present in the hallway. but the strange thing was that when we mentioned it, the front desk staff said they had not received a complaint like that before. what??? by the way, that seems to be contradicted by at least one other review i saw on here. | overall, the staff seem really pleasant and eager to please. its just perplexing to me that a) this issue has not come up before and b) they would not anticipate it could be a problem to people and be really clear about it when booking.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed in a single room, november 12-14. the room was about the size of a dorm room single and kind of spartan, but it and the bathroom were clean. what disappointed me were the common areas, the staff, and the breakfast. at check-in you had to get someone is attention as nobody seemed to want to take the next person in line. it was hard to understand the staff - english must be their second or third language. the elevators were grubby, the lobby smelled of stale smoke and really needed vacuuming the whole time i was there. do yourself a favor and pass on the breakfast. there are so many other places to eat it does not make any sense to pay 12 pounds for coffee, toast, and a yogurt, which were the only halfway appetizing items they had. the hot breakfast looked nasty. by the way, the v&amp;a across the street has a great cafeteria with tasty sandwiches, hot meals, desserts... i wish i had found it sooner. the rembrandt is an okay place, but i am trying somewhere else next time.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''this is one of the most beautiful hotels, and it carries the fairmont name. we were very excited to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday here. it was very expensive, but we thought it would be worth it. unfortunately, we were very wrong. every day seemed to have its own issue. to start, they stuck us in a horrible room. after 2 days, they finally moved us into a room that was much nicer. they brought us cake and strawberries for celebrating. then housekeeping removed them, and they were never replaced as we were told they would be. they had us checking out on the wrong date, and i had to spend an hour arguing with them about our pre-paid room, and the dates we had paid for, which almost caused us to miss our train to paris. they double locked our room while we were in paris, which was great, but we could not get back in, even after we were told we would be able to. staff walked into our room multiple times without knocking. the last straw was when my earrings went missing the day we were checking out. the hotel has ""found"" the earrings, but this was completely unacceptable. the disappointment cannot be put into words. we spent a lot of money for this hotel, and it was not worth it.'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''we made a reservation for the alain ducasse restaurant on the 12th of november at 8.30 pm for 4 people.on arrival we contacted reception who pointed us to the bar in the main entrance hall where all seats where take,i therefore went to the two young ladies on the entrance to the restaurant to inform them of our arrival at 8pm,they also pointed to the bar area that was full, i then cleared the glasses myself and rearranged the chairs so we had someone to sit not assistance was offered by any member of staff. | after being seated know one came to us for over 10 minutes so i stood at the bar without any response to get some drinks,eventually a waiter arrived very embarrassed by the whole situation. | we entered the restaurant and the service was exceptional throughout the whole meal. | the food was another stories tasteless and three dishes covered in white truffle making the food sickly ,even the cheese course contained truffle,the main came which was beef and this was pale and insipid we guessed this had being cooked in a water bath so again was tasteless and slimy | the whole meal experience was a huge disappointment by all our party,just the week before we had eaten at le manoir which was in a different class and deserved its michelin stars, the dorchester in my experience did not deserve any!! | cwm leeds'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''on the surface and in pictures (like so many hotels these days) it seems this is a quality 4 star hotel. but my experience reveals that it is not. it barely qualifies as 2.5 star hotel in my opinion. here is a list of things that were experienced during our recent stay; | 1. room had creaking floorboards throughout the room. | 2. a/c was faulty and emitting a noise that requires earplugs to deaden. despite 2 promises to fix it, it took us calling 3 times before a member of staff had the sensible idea to move us and offered it to us. there was no record of our previous calls, even though non-maintenance staff came to the room to try to address the problem the previous two times. | 3. no 2nd sheet in the bed and sleeping became way too hot with the duvet as the only covering. | 4. beds are narrow and terribly squeaky/noisy. | 4. unfinished bath panel falling off its fixings. | 5. sink blocked. | 6. one of the water jet nozzles in the bath fell off when the system was turned on. | 7. maid not fully cleaning room | 8. insecure windows left open after maid cleaned (left open all day in effect), without us knowing. | 9. toilets are uncomfortable to sit on (poor design). | 10. support rail in one of the elevators was falling off its fixings. | 11. the mobile phone that is provided has no user guide or info provided. only one handset per room. | i might expect these in a 2-3 star hotel and not bother saying anything, but this is not such a hotel. either the owners have let the hotel go, or there has been a change in operations/ownership along with a new mindset about what they should be offering. | i certainly would not stay there again.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''this could be a good hotel if more attention was paid to detail, facilities were properly maintained and the staff were more approachable. we stayed for one night and will never go there again. the television/remote control would not work correctly and the extract fan in the bathroom was defunct making the room unpleasant to use. if you foolishly decide to stay at this hotel make sure you take ear plugs with you, as the noise from the air conditioning system is diabolical (even when turned off). we got very little sleep due to an intermittent sound like an electric drill boring into a concrete wall. | the breakfast which is self service (except coffee and tea) can only be rated as below average. the cooked food - fried eggs and bacon etc, was pre prepared (not cooked to order) and looked very greasy and unappetising. the coffee was lukewarm and for some reason the cereals were located in another part of the room well away from the main self service bar, which was not pointed out by the waiter serving coffee. there was no fresh fruit available just horrible dried stuff. | when my wife asked at reception if we could have drinking water in our room, she was told to ask in the bar. the bar staff were most unhelpful and said it was not available and that we would have to pay for water from the minibar in our room (over 2 for a very small bottle!). is it right that we should have to pay for drinking water? | i have stayed at far better and more friendly hotels in london.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''our 3 night stay at this hotel was a nightmare from start to finish. we chose this hotel specifically because we thought they would be able to accommodate my food allergies and because of the central location. the only positive point was that the hotel is very nicely located on the south bank. | the problems began with the request to use the stairs to access the room. this was requested in advance of arrival however had not been pre-arranged as expected. a swipe card is required to access the stairs and the same card will open the door again at your floor. the first time we used the card (when we eventually received it), it let us out and we thought all was ok. however when coming back in, we were not able to get out of the stairwell at our floor. this was incredibly frustrating after walking up many stairs. so down we went again to get it sorted, we were escorted back up to our floor while we waited for the card to be fixed, and later on it was brought back to our room. we asked if it could be tested to make sure it worked, and the man went away, came back again and assured us that it did. needless to say the next time we went out and then came back again, we were again stranded at the top of the stairs with a non-functional card. another trip back down and a manager fixed the card for us. | the following morning we went for breakfast. the hotel were pre-notified of my dairy and wheat allergies, upon arrival i again wrote them down at the front desk (as they seemed to know nothing about it), and they knew we were coming for breakfast. the restaurant staff said that they had a note that one of us had allergies but they did not know anything else. this was surprising considering we had email conversations with the kitchen before arrival and had written down the details when checking in. the waiting staff had no idea what i could or could not have from the buffet so cooked me something from the menu. not very long into beginning eating i had an allergic reaction to dairy products. i complained as much as i could given that i could not breathe properly to the manager at the front desk before spending the ray of the day unable to do anything because i felt so ill. | the manager and the kitchen manager were apologetic but insisted that they followed procedure in the kitchen. my lack of being able to breathe properly disagreed with this. | on the last evening there once again the key to the stairs did not work, thankfully this time at the bottom of the stairs. i was reaching the end of my tether by this point and was promised that a new card would be delivered to the room shortly. no card was delivered. | other observations were that there seemed to be very strong air freshener pumped out of the vents in the lobby, the whole hotel was very very dark, i did not care for the less than relaxing rap music in the lobby and the room was so hot (in the middle of winter) that the air conditioning had to stay on all night. one blessing was that the room was very clean, the bed was comfortable and the shower was fantastic. | all in all i would not stay here again and it ruined our holiday in more ways than one.'''",0
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''we were deeply disappointed in many facets of our stay at the wellsley. but before we review the reason for this poor rating, we should note a few of the excellent points at the property. | the location is fantastic, across from hyde park and just next to a tube station. it would be hard to find a better location. | prior to the incidents upon arrival which i will describe in detail shortly, we were scheduled for an upgrade from a jr one bedroom park view suite to a full one bedroom suite. the suite itself was stunning with the finest in decor. even if it was ""overdecorated"" to the point of being impractical, it was visually stunning. | because of our numerous issues, we met a management employee named andre who was genuine and sincere in his desire to turn things around for us. when he was directly involved, the experience could not have been better. but when he was not involved.... | now, unfortunately, i need to advise my fellow travelers on some issues: | first, we relied on the reviews of others on this site who said when they traveled to this hotel the cigar smoke was contained. it is not. it permeates the first floor - rendering its facilities useless. it permeates the elevators and the hallways. it did not enter the room in any recognizable way, thankfully. to some this will be good news to have a property which welcomes cigar smoke. but for us, it was a serious issue. therefore, if you do not like smoke, then i would not book this hotel under any circumstance. | second, our arrival could not have been more problematic. it was the worst arrival at a luxury hotel we have ever experienced. when delivering us to check in, our driver was yelled at by the valet in a rude way, scaring him and startling us. the agent who checked us in told us we had not paid when we had paid in full 6 weeks earlier. the room was not ready and we were told we could sit in the bar. when we explained our sensitivity to smoke, the agent then told us there was no smoke. we then went to the dorchester for tea and never received the call or text saying our room was ready. finally, after our travel agent called, they explained it was their fault, that i had paid, and then told her we were getting an upgrade when in fact we had received the upgrade long before since that was the reason we were given that the room was not ready. | throughout the stay, there were numerous issues: | no bedsheet on the bed one evening; | 31 minutes to receive ice water for breakfast; | laundry cleaned but then taken out of plastic to then be placed in dirty drawers, rendering them unclean again; | i could go on and on. | upon check out, i was stunned to see i had been charged 6.99 (!) per day for a nyt and 4.00 per day for a wsj - both of which i had on my ipad. | i asked for an adjustment of the bill and received 54.00 off a several thousand dollar bill after all the issues we encountered. we were shocked, disappointed, and insulted that the hotel management apologized for sub standard service (both in writing and verbally) and then offered us compensation of 54.00 after several days of our vacation were ruined. | when in a foreign country where you stay really matters. moreover, when you pay large sums of money for a luxury hotel, one should expect to receive the service you pay for. this hotel has its good points, but given the issues which were so obvious in most every department from the time we arrived to the time we left, i would not stay here again and suggest you think carefully before you do as well.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''the savoy needs a serious revamp, the rooms are not up to scratch and for the price it is a bit depressing, the balcony for our room was a disgrace, dead birds, broken glass, paint peeling from the exterior walls amongst other things. | i will say though the american bar is fantastic the dry martini was invented there. the pianist (mauro monturo) is amazing, you name it he can play it, but alas the bar and the food can not make up for the rooms, oh and the fact that they charge 35 to turn the bed down. | go to the dorchester, connaught or claridges some of which are from the same group but are of a higher standard'''",0
Hartley Hotel,"'''the phrase 'you get what you pay for' has never been truer when it comes to describing this place. it is cheap, but far from cheerful. the rooms themselves are ok, but as far as positive comments go, that is it. the staff who work on reception are utterly ignorant and amongst the rudest people i have ever met and it seems their only concern is getting your money off you as quickly as they can! it is also a struggle to hold a conversation as they do not speak very good english, and on occasion they seem almost confrontational as you try to explain for the third time how long you intend to stay etc. | i would recommend to spend an extra few quid and stop somewhere else, unless of course you like being woken up at all hours by banging doors, people shouting and being generally rowdy. | i have stayed at many digs across the country and i can safely say i will not be coming back to this one.'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''yes, this hotel is quite affordable. but having spent three sleepless nights at the ridgemount, i would recommend other holiday travelers go ahead and she will out another 50 for better lodgings where you might actually get a decent night's rest. after all, if you are spending several thousand dollars for your holiday, what is the sense of saving a few pounds to spend your days stumbling around london with every bone and muscle aching and your brain in a sleep-deprived haze? | if you insist on ignoring this advice to save a few pennies by staying at the ridgemount (note well, i did not write ""sleeping"" at the ridgemount), do not--under any circumstances--allow yourself to be placed in a room that faces the street. for three nights, we were mercilessly tortured in room 19, a ground floor en suite twin room with a window just a few feet from roaring traffic, traffic that hardly let us up until the hour or so just before dawn. (our industrial-strenght earplugs were inadequate to dampen the noise. we would have asked to be moved, but the hotel was fully booked.) | a night at the ridgemount on the narrow, short, and extremely hard beds with mopeds zooming past (at what seems like) inches from your head approximates the experience of sleeping on a london sidewalk, except that one must acknowledge the ridgemount was, to its credit, much cleaner than the sidewalk, scrupulously clean, in fact. | cleanliness and neighborhood location, though they do count for much, are the ridgemounts only unequivocally positive qualities. the facility itself lacks any suggestion of charm or grace, and the furnishings are uniformly old, cheap, worn, dowdy, crowded, uncomfortable--and very, very clean. | as for the breakfast, it was, by american standards and more so by london standards, unimpressive: frosted corn flake cereal (which i do not particularly care for), coffee, orange juice, one egg cooked sunny-side up, two slices of ham/bacon, white bread toast, rather good marmelade jam, and a lifeless vegetable. the only variation in the breakfast offering was the vegetable: half a grilled tomato the first day, canned beans the other days. the breakfast waitstaff, most of whom appeared to be eastern european immigrant girls in their late-teens and early twenties, were charmingly shy, prompt, quiet, and unobtrusive. indeed, our brief interactions with these young ladies were by far the most endearing aspect of our ridgemount experience. | the hotel desk staff were--for the most part--civil and responsive to our few inquiries, and the young man working mornings at the desk gave us accurate and helpful information about bus routes. however, a different young man at the desk the evening of the last night of our stay could not conceal his irritation when, as i explained that we had an early flight to rome the next day and would be pressed for time, i asked to settle our bill that night rather than waiting until the morning. he kept telling me i could do it in the morning. i kept explaining that we would be rushed in the morning, and would like to settle the bill now. he relented only when i stated flatly that i would pay the bill now and handed him my credit card. | i almost forgot to mention that, in response to my initial email inquiry for a twin room en suite, i was quoted a rate of 52 per night. but after i sent my credit card information to finalize the booking, the email confirming my booking for the requested accommodations quoted a higher rate of 68 per night. upon checking the information posted on the ridgemonts web site, i was able to see that the hotel had erred by initially quoting me the rate for a room without a bathroom, even though i had asked for a room with a private bath, so i did not complain about what seemed to be an honest mistake. however, at checkout i did not at all appreciate the surly hotel desk clerk's unsolicited and falsely hospitable offer to denominate the charge on my credit card in us dollars rather than british pounds. this sly trick, which inexperienced travelers fall for all the time, is known as ""dynamic currency conversion"" and creates a windfall profit for the merchant while substantially increasing the cost of the transaction for the customer, who will receive a highly unfavorable exchange rate from the merchant yet still pay whatever (and sometimes double) the ""foreign transaction fee"" that the credit card issuer normally adds to charges made in foreign countries. in my opinion, any hotel or merchant that presents the ""dynamic currency conversion"" option, without explaining its unfavorable consequences to the customer, does not care about the customers best interests.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''i last stayed at this hotel some 22 years ago, so to draw a comparison would be unreasonable. however, its major attraction is still its location, in one of the best areas of london, with good public transport and within a 5 minute walk to south kensington underground station on a direct line to the airport. it is also close to harrods and harvey nichols stores and there is a wide choice of restaurants nearby. it is directly opposite the v and a and other major museums. you know you are in a posh part of london because the neighbouring streets are parked out with lamborghinis, ferraris, porsches, luxury mercedes and beemers, land rovers and mini coopers, far outnumbering the more humble cars of the hoi polloi. | the hotel entrance is imposing leading to a rather drab and faded foyer. apart from the odd sunny african, the hotel is almost wholly staffed by east europeans and russians, with attitudes to match, from the sullen and unsmiling receptionists to the gulag-grey clad waiters. | the room we were given was at the front of the building, small but comfortable looking, but with insufficient space for two suitcases. there was a large wardrobe but surprisingly and irritatingly for a stay of five days, no drawers at all. the beds had duvets that in a poorly ventilated room were unbearably hot at night, and the windows could only be opened a few inches. the refurbished bathroom was largish,but poorly laid out. the basin area had no space or shelves for toiletries and the taps that intriguingly gushed hot water from both hot and cold were antique ones dating from the 1960s and difficult to operate, particularly in the plug area. | if you like an english breakfast, as i do, this is the place for you. it was excellent with a full and tasty range of eggs, sausages, bacon, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, potato cakes and the ubiquitous baked beans. if you are a continental, preferring something more elegant and less substantial, the pickings are meagre indeed and poorly presented - a choice of two or three different sliced meats, with the ham lumped high on a plate, and a choice of two plastic wrapped mini-cheeses. the fruit offerings consisted of two bowls of canned peaches and apricots, and for fresh fruit, there were plates of sliced oranges and water melon that looked like they had been attacked with a machete. the mini-muffins and the light and excellent mini-croissants were piled unattractively on top of each other, and in conformity with the mini theme, there was a choice of just three mini jars of honey, marmalade or jam. | in summary, this was poorly presented cafeteria style and had none of the elegance that could be expected from a four star hotel. this extended to the tables for two, crowded together and on a busy morning within clatter and chatter distance of fellow guests. the laminate topped tables had no tablecloths and the coffee was served in plain white mugs which i loathe. whatever happened to english bone china cups and saucers? | i have one further gripe. i suspected that my credit card had been debited for the total cost of my stay on checking in, and specifically asked that this not be done as i wished to pay part of the cost on checking out with left-over pounds. in spite of an assurance, this was not done and i was charged upfront something that i have not experienced in other quality hotels. quite reasonably after a five night stay, i asked for a late check-out at 2 pm as i had an evening flight out to singapore. the backstage politburo had decreed that this could only be agreed to subject to a supplementary charge of 20 pounds, and on this issue, the stoney-faced receptionist could not be moved. | i can only suggest that management take a trip to europe, the us and asia, to learn how hotels operate there and what service, warmth and presentation mean, but i fear that this in not on the agenda of this hotel group which seems mainly interested in cutting to the bone and making as much profit as possible. | maybe i am spoiled, maybe its london, but as far as i am concerned, this hotel does not tick all the boxes in spite of its favourable location.'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''worst accomodation i have stayed in - room was dirty, staff were unorganised and not friendly at all. check in process was unorganised and took way too long. might seem cheap but it is not central and definitely not worth it. would have been better off staying in a hostel.'''",0

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''the best that can be said of this hotel is that it is clean and convenient. once you find it down what is really an alley, you will not be rewarded. | yes, it is passable and nice enough, but it is not a luxury hotel nor is it a good business hotel. the best that can be said about it is that it is walking distance to many businesses in the city and to broadgate center. | room service is incredibly limited. it has gotten better since my last stay there in february, but it is still sub-par. | most rooms are tiny, which may be typical for london, but there are not other redeeming qualities. | the hallways are dark. there is 1 restaurant that you have to go by to get in and out of the hotel. a great deal of the staff is bilingual, but english is not their first language. | they delivered my laundry to the wrong room. | most of the rooms look into another building, and they are close enough to almost read the computer screens! | i was lucky to be upgraded to a room with a balcony - which gave me enough space to change my mind! | residents must run a gauntlet past smokers to get into the hotel.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''we have stayed at the rembrandt many times; this time will be our last. we were greeted by a male receptionist who was trying to do so many things as he checked us and another couple in that it resulted in him doing none of them well and four unhappy guests. nor would it be difficult in the 21st century to add onto electronic bookings that we were returning guests, and greeted as such, instead of us having to tell the staff we are returning each time a new customer form is thrust into our hand each time we visit. the room we were given initially was not an executive room which we had paid for, although we were moved promptly. the fruit bowl had been reduced from a nice assortment of different fruits to three apples; when i questioned this, i was told it is a fruit bowl - i beg to differ! breakfast as always was of a good standard, which we enjoyed in our room each day, and was always ontime. sadly it is a case of us using this hotel for so many of our london breaks that we have been witness to it is penny pinching money saving antics over time. i would also be interested to know why when customer feedback is requested and one gives it, why no acknowledgement is ever received when clearly the guest has not enjoyed their visit - i fear this may be the result of using such a large faceless company such as this hotel chain.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''for a group of five, 120 a night seemed very good. we were prepared to all be sharing the same room and same bathroom as advertised. received a phone call the day before we were due to travel, saying that we were being split across three rooms (it sounded like three rooms, one double, one twin, and possibly another twin for the last friend of ours. difficult to understand over phone.) this seemed ok as i assumed we were still reasonably together and in a hotel, and that each room would have its own bathroom. so i agreed on the phone and left it at that. | upon turning up, we were taken out of the main hotel building (which from what we saw did not look too bad) and next door into a block of flats. each flat seemed to be split into around four rooms, with a shared bathroom. we ended up with one twin room, two single rooms, and another single in another part of the building! it also turned out that our next door room-neighbor was a staff member who lived there? it felt like we were staying at a strangers house! so my partner and i were sharing a bathroom with two of our friends, a staff member of the hotel, and the random guests he seemed to have himself?!? | the decor was tidy but shabby. bathroom well-used. each bed had one clean towel supplied which was fresh each day. the tv in our room worked fine (one set of batteries for two remotes was fun though) and we had freeview. our friends rooms had either no freeview or a tv that did not work at all. tea and coffee facilities supplied, had to plug kettle in and leave on the floor to boil. beds varying degrees of lumpiness, did not dare investigate beneath sheets but first inspection was clean. one pillow per bed, ranging from ""ok thickness"" to ""you are basically sleeping on the mattress"". | noise was a combination of shared bathroom next door to our room (which had a terribly loud noise every time toilet flushed or taps were used), our staff-neighbour next door who had guests over who slammed the doors until 1am (we could hear every word of their conversations, walls very thin) and the main road outside our window. windows useless, was as if they were wide open, could hear conversations of people passing in the street. curtains may as well have not been there either. did not fully close, broken so did not meet in the middle, thin as anything. | breakfast fine, buffet-style full english with cereal and fruit as options. this was served over in the main hotel, from 7-9. due to sharing a block of flats with other random guests, did not feel very safe as there was no reception or door security for the block. not filthy but not clean. paid a deposit of 10 per set of keys, but as there were so many of us (and we were not all there for check-in) paid 20 for four sets of keys, refunded on checkout. no hairdryer in rooms. | overall, if you are staying in the main hotel you might get what you paid for. for us though, it was a whole load of strange and unwelcome surprises. combine this with a very bright, noisy room, ended up with two terrible nights sleep. will not return.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''went for scones and some dessert. their selection of desserts falls really short. and priced at around 9 each, i was expecting a reasonably sized portion, however there was hardly anything put on the plate. garnishes seemed to be more important than anything edible. i would not advise/encourage their desserts. their scones, however were not bad. settings are very pretty.'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''on arrival the late middle aged owner and i had a disagreement over the deposit paid for by a colleague; we arrived before the colleague and the hotel owner exploded in a furious temper when i told him i was only staying one night; the colleague was staying two nights in a separate room; my companion and i in our own room. [the colleagues the owner, an older middle aged man, has a furious verbal temper and is what we call wha: a walking heart attack. best to have a cell (mobile) phone in case you have to call the medics for him. | the rooms: | almost every building on gower street over the length of at least three long blocks is a hotel so there is no shortage of other places to choose from if you want to sleep at a gower street hotel with traffic noise all night long. | at the ridgemount, expect to have a long night with no sleep. our room looked out on gower street, and even with the traffic dramatically lessened from the early february snowstorm, there were trucks and buses rumbling and clanging along all night long; around 4:00-5:00 a.m. a lot more traffic began going by; it was impossible to sleep. | breakfast: | the worst i have encountered at a b&amp;b or hotel in the uk. for cold cereal they use whole fat milk. (do not bother asking for non-fat or even skim milk). | toast is made with white bread; do not bother asking for multi-grain, whole wheat or anything healthy, there is no fresh fruit. | suggest go a few blocks away to the president hotel (also in the russell square district) where one can rent a clean, nicer room, no street traffic noise, and where they have a decent breakfast including fresh fruit, breads, pastries, croissants, hot and cold breakfast foods.'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''where to begin? when a room has a bathroom ensuite, i expect a bathroom. well, there was one: a toilet, sink and shower crammed in a tiny 1x1 meters space. imagine showering in an airplane cabin. or more accurate, imagine airplanes crammed a shower in their tiny toilet cabins. you get the picture. | and the double bed was not really big, but worse, the mattress was so old and broken. i am a healthy twenty something and thanks to lots of sports have a pretty healthy back. but boy, did that back of mine hurt. like a lot.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we travel alot and love staying at fancy hotels and eating at gourmet restaurants and being pampered while on vacation. unfortunately, we did not feel entirely pampered at the savoy. i read all the mixed reviews on this site before making my reservation because i hoped that the 5 star place where claude monet painted would be a wonderful experience. i am sad to report that the bad reviews were right. the front desk staff is young, and sometimes maybe immature, and the professionism was uneven to say the best. we arrived not feeling welcomed at all. | our first room (yes, we had to move) had a b'dai that did not work and almost caused a flood while we were there. they did not handle it well. after someone came to the room to inspect, we were not offered another room, but we were told that a plumber would come the next day? after worrying about how we were going to plan our day around a plumber, we finally called and asked if we could be moved and they coplied which relieved us but we still had to pack up and plan around the move the next day. the second room was bigger, but really just acceptable by american standards. there were stains (food?) on the carpet, not too big but really something that looked liked it could have been cleaned better. the first room with the bad b'dai was too small, and there could have been a meter more length at least. one walked carefully betwen the bed and bureau but it had high ceilings and beautiful old details. the marble bathrooms were pretty beautiful too, and the place is right on the river pracitically--which makes it a beautiful property. the buffet restaurant staff were definitely well trained, and were very accommodating. the food quality was excellent. the banquette restaurant staff were also great and the menu read well. we almost had dinner at the savoy grill which looked great too. the concierge staff were also helpful and very nice. our highlight was hot stuff a restaurant recommended in the nytimes, where the proprietor taj was so kind. i guess my feeling of savoy is mixed too, my feeling is that i basically was not made to feel totally at home there, half the time, i was greeted warmly in the halls by the staff the other times made to feel awkward --but i can say that i will not be returning to the savoy anytime soon. i did fully enjoy my time there but i wish it would have been more like i imagined it before now,'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the proprietor is eager to please and working hard to refurbish an old building, but there is not much he can do with 7'x12' rooms and 7'x3' bathrooms (most baths are newly fitted--night lights are a nice touch). with a double bed and a built-in desk/wardrobe, there was literally no place to open suitcases except on the bed, and no place to store them except in the microscopic floor space. 2 people could not dress at once, and there was only one chair. young backpackers with no luggage might find it acceptable. | despite the advertised ""all rooms air-conditioned"", only half the rooms are; the rest are in the ""hannex"" almost 2 blocks away. ours was too warm and noisy with the window open and fan on. continental breakfast is served only in the main building; cooked breakfast is 3 extra. no lifts. convenient for paddington station (about 4 blocks away) and heathrow express. we appreciated the free wifi, which worked most of the time. we did not use the small refrigerator or the tv.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''went for breakfast, my cousin and i were sat next to two middle eastern ladies. later on the daughter of one of the ladies came, and the waiter was saying things like ""morning, princess, where are you from?saudi?"" after getting the answer of qatar, the waiter expressed his admiration and said:""my name is xx, today i will be your servant etc."" | in contrast, the same waiter served me with a cold attitude. is it because i am asian? is this borderline racism? i do not know.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''before i start this review i have noticed that they only reply to good reviews rather than an indifferent one which i find very poor. | anyway i stayed here first weekend of march with my other half. we had upgraded before we arrived and while the room was a decent size, it was no bigger than a travelodge or prem inn. the bathroom was also much the same size. | breakfast was good, although the tables are only about 3 inches apart so having a private conversation is not good. | my main issue was the leisure facilities which you actually have to pay for on a daily basis which i found a bit cheeky as it is about 6 a time and during the weekend we were there the pool was used as swimming lessons for local kids and there parents sat round the pool and jacuzzi all the time which gave us no privacy. they were also allowed in with outdoor shoes which is not nice when you are using the pool.. as reported in another review the website does not state that the sauna/steam is not mixed which spoiled it for us as were looking to relax together. there are only 2 loungers to relax on, of which were always in use so all in all we never really enjoyed the leisure facilities as much as we could have. they could have a lot more loungers but choose to put the family changing rooms up above the pool which takes up a lot of space, and to be honest the families do not use them as i had a father with his daughter and son in my changing room which was very embarrassing as i needed to get undressed. what would have happened if we had used there changing rooms ? | i think the hotel needs to decide whether the pool is open to local families or people who actually stay at the hotel, and maybe charge 3 a time and put it to a local charity as we already had paid enough for the hotel. all in all would not go back unless i knew some of the above issues were addressed'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we booked in to stay at the rhodes from sunday to thursday and although the website looks good the actual hotel is somewhat different. there were refurbishment works going on and timbers, bathroom fittings littered the reception and hallways. the breakfast itself was very basic continental unless you wanted to pay an extra 6 for full english, tea and coffee was available together with a small selection of fruit, toast, cheese, ham and cereal. having paid for what we thought was bed and breakfast we did not want to she will out another 50 for the 4 days for breakfast and feel that it would be better for the hotel to simply up their prices to allow for this. | the room itself was very small and the as mentioned by other reviewers the hotel in general is very dated and needing a lot of attention. we did have a major problem with our room in that when we came back from our first day out, the door to the room simply pushed open without the need for the key which i assume was because the cleaner did not shut it properly and may have been the because of other reviewers issues as there is no security to the hotel and you could simply wander around and enter other rooms if they are left open. we advised the reception manager of this but were left without an apology or an explanation as to what they would do about it, an awkward pause was the extent of the reaction! | the owner mr crias was friendly with us but i guess as we did not really complain and just wanted to get on with our trip he was going to be amiable enough. | all in all a very good location for hyde park and picadilly albeit very much overpriced and not somewhere i would want to stay again in a hurry.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''just returned after staying in the place for two nights, friday 26th and sat 27th may, | we were on the ground floor at he front of the hotel. | saturday we left the hotel at around 1pm to go to a concert, upon our return at around 12.30 pm there was bunch of around 10 to 15 youths in the car park sat on the wall which is very close to the downstairs rooms drinking singing and playing music, this went on till around 3 am, do not know if they were guest or just local youths, not nice when this is going on a few feet outside your window. | and speaking of windows upon entering our room the sash window had been left open all day by the cleaners !!!!!!!!!!!!, its a downstairs room, right next tot he road, thank god we hadn`t been burgled !!!, i went to reception to complain, ""oh this is a good hotel sir no burglaries !!!, i was in a right state, | i didn`t eat breakfast on either morning so cannot comment, the toilet never flushed properly, and the inside of the shower cubicle was in poor condition, you got one smallish towel per guest, and there was constant noise from guests above. | i would never stay there again, just glad i did not lose any of my stuff, still in shock now.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''i have stayed at this hotel before, but my last stay in october had a serious issue. when i checked in, i asked for a single non-smoking room. i was told that i could have a ensuite or basic (cheaper), and i selected the basic, as i was only staying one night. the room smelled of air freshner when i put my stuff in, so i opened the window and went to upton park station to take the underground into london. | when i returned at night, the window was closed and the room stunk like smoke. i complained at the front desk, and the clerk (who was smoking at the time), told me there were no other rooms, and gave me a can of air freshner. | i was not able to sleep well and had to leave the window and door open to get enough air to breath.'''",0

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i have been a member of tripadvisor since 2009, and travel rather frequently but i have never felt compelled to write a review until my awful recent stay at the corinthia. i returned to the corinthia this week. i was booked to stay for 3 nights but checked out after 1 and moved to claridge's due to a catalogue of issues (the worst being served uncooked chicken) at the corinthia. i stayed here in september and it was very impressive then, however my stay in the past few days was simply awful. how a hotel can go from excellent to awful in such a short space of time baffles me! after seeing the other recent negative reviews i felt i too had to share my comments. whilst it is a very nicely designed hotel, on this occasion it was chaotic, service was hit and miss, there was a lack of clear integrity and sadly none one really dealt with my complaints appropriately until i refused to stay a moment longer and checked out (at 11.30pm at night) after my room service chicken dish was served raw. sadly, i did really like this hotel after my previous stay, but this time it was very different. | the issues encountered included: | 1. raw chicken being served as part of the lebanese mixed grill room service. please see photo. simply unacceptable, a risk to health! | 2. cleanliness issues: half eaten chocolate wrapper in bedroom drawer upon check-in, evening turn down service staff left dirty glasses in my room, no products were replenished and a wet towel left behind. staff ringing the room doorbell despite my do not disturb light being on. | 3. the spa hygiene standards were appalling on the first evening we arrived. used plaster on the side of the spa pool, used cups scattered all over the floor and piles of used bathrobes left and towels on the floor around the pool and sauna areas. not at all what one would expect of a five star hotel. no spa attendants at all on this occasion. if standards of health &amp; safety and hygiene cannot be maintained due to staff shortages on new year's day then i would suggest you temporarily close the spa until you have enough staff to service it appropriately. | 4.luggage and bags stored in the hallway on 5th floor for a day or so. people sat on the floor unpacking luggage in the hallway. | 5.when calling reception or housekeeping no one picks up. at one point my husband was forced to go down to reception to speak to someone as no one was answering the phone and after waiting 40 minutes for a call back. | 6. the hotel offers free upgrades subject to availability on their website if booking direct. i am also a member of their loyalty programme. on checkin i was informed an upgrade was not available to the next category, despite my having checked online that rooms were still available to book in the next few categories. i felt a little trust between guest and staff was lost. the next day after chasing for the upgrade we were eventually offered an upgrade which we chose to decline as the room was rather dark. i felt they thought they were doing us a favour with the upgrade. we were also offered an upgrade to a suite to make up for the issues we experienced but we would have to pay another 900 per night. sadly to me this was not a genuine offer of apology or upgrade but rather an insult. | 7. very poor at handling complaints: on the first evening i informed the duty manager of the issues with the poor standard of cleaning in my room and the spa. he said he would get the day manager to look into the issues and revert to me first thing. he promised to investigate and revert to me. i never heard back from anyone. midday next day when chasing about the upgrade we had to mention the issues again and the fact no one had addressed them with us. all i needed was for someone to take the time to speak with me with empathy about the concerns and assure me these issues were not going to be repeated. | 8.eventually, we were offered a complimentary meal which was then reduced to 100 off the bill as a gesture to apologise for the issues. this was a nice gesture but money does not make up for a poor experience. | 9.finally, after we thought things were at last improving, we were served raw chicken. this was the last straw. | at this point we packed our bags and checked out. they did not charge us for the room and did finally apologise sincerely (jean was most sincere) but the experience has left me very saddened. we checked into claridge's at midnight. i then contacted the general manager thomas fischer at the corinthia the next morning to bring these issues to his attention personally. i hope my comments will be used constructively. needless to say claridge's is wonderfully elegant as always and we have extended our stay here as it is such a wonderful place and we need to detox from our unpleasant experience. very sad that the start of my new year has been tainted by this unpleasant experience. i am afraid to say the corinthia is very much style over substance. very sadden as the hotel has such great potential. i will consider returning if and when the standards and service improve and are consistent.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we decided to stay at the mondrian on our wedding night and unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. | our wedding reception was on the southbank 10 minutes away and we checked in around midnight. the reaction of the guy on the front desk was not great. we did not expect special treatment, but we did not expect to be smirked at either. a simple 'congratulations' would have made us at least feel welcome. the guests however were lovely! | our room was smart and clean, and it was at least a practical location for us. but i cannot help but wish we went elsewhere. i think we would have had a warmer welcome at the premier inn. | i would be happy to stay somewhere like this on a business trip, but it was not the right choice for a special occasion.'''",0

The Rembrandt,'''someone entered our room between 12 am and 3.30 am and stole our passport and credit cards. the hotel's response was minimal. they would not even provide us an extended check-out so that we could go to the embassy and get things in order. there was no concern for guest welfare. there are no cctv's within the hotel. the hotel manager declined to meet with us and did not even give the courtesy to check-in with us. stay away!''',0
The Dorchester,"'''i went to the bar in the dorchester after eating in the allan ducaisse restaurant, i was accosted by a security thug/manager at the door who said that the bar was only for residents, i said i was a resident and this security thug continued to shout at me to show my hotel key.even when i hgav ethe key he would not believe me and went ot recepytion to confirm. i am black .on sitting down, i saw three skimply dressed blonde hookers,chatting very cordially with the barmen. i met and chatted with a white couple who said they were not residents,. so i was sure i had been a victim of racism and discrimaination, this experience ruined my evening, and my stay in the hotel and i would think twice about staying or recommeding it.i warn other ethnic minorities about this racist policy.even when i complained to the duty manager there were no apologies from him or upper management , even though i stayed for two more days.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we have stayed at a few mandarins, with our favourite being the flagship in hong kong. | however the experience in london was not a good one, and we will not return: | 1. upon weekday arrival at 4pm, we were asked to wait for 20 minutes for our room, making us late for a meeting. | 2. upon checkin we were not told that the main restaurant was closed due to food poisoning. having breakfast with a view on hyde park was one of the main reasons to choose the mandarin. the alternative in the basement was overheated and felt like a 3 star us hotel restaurant. so we had breakfast at the berkeley hotel opposite. | 3. the room itself was run-down, with paint peeling off the walls. the walls are thin so that we were woken by neighbours music at 7am. the telephone did not work. in fact, the entire interior of the hotel is in dire need of renovation. | 4. charging for internet access is ridiculous for a hotel of this stature and these rates. | 5. before checking out, we asked reception to prepare the bill, which they did not. then the computers did not work, and we were delayed again. | fittingly, upon checking out and leaving, not a single person asked us how are stay was - always a bad sign.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''my husband and i do not mind spending money when it comes to treating our selves but on the occasion of my 50th birthday it was a complete disaster. as we never received an email confirmation for booking (was it made, i wonder?) from the simpson's in the strand restaurant, we did not have table ready and after waiting for around 40 minutes we left. the rest of the customer services varied from excellent (concierge) to very poor (restaurant and bars hosts, lower management). the property is exquisitely renovated but it is to be expected at this level. we have received a refund for the meal we ate at kaspar's where we set at the bar like any casual guests who popped in on a chance to be seated. i think it is fair to say that we will back to the dorchester where the standard of service match the surroundings.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''the service in this so-called ""grand dame"" hotel in london leaves much to be desired. i had many service flaws during my stay, more in line with a 2 star hotel: | 1. the air conditioner in my room broke in the middle of the night, and the room heated up rapidly, waking me up. i called service, and the engineer promptly arrived. it took him about 45 minutes total to diagnose and fix the problem. i appreciated this. but, there was no followup and no apology from the hotel management regarding this, despite my sleep being ruined my first night. | 2. also during my first night, at 11p, someone from the hotel mistakenly rang my doorbell, waking me up. again, no apology from the hotel. | 3. i requested a coffee tray at check-in. did not receive it. had to call again to get it. this is a minor complaint, but still at a 5-star hotel where one pays a lot of money per night, i expect a top notch service. | 4. i did not receive a turndown service my first night in the hotel. | the room itself is good, spacious. the room bathrooms are nice. the hotel gym is nice, and well equipped with weights and cardio equipment. | the hotel staff is very detached in their interaction with guests, unlike other london hotels such as the goring. | the elevators are blocked off at certain times, and it takes forever to get an elevator. | upon checkout, nobody bothered to ask how my stay was. nobody followed up on the above issues. pretty pathetic. | needless to say, i will not be staying at the dorchester again.'''",0
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''that was suppose to be a relaxing weekend and for this reason we did booked this hotel in the city of london really quite during weekend. first impression at the reception: yeah cool really nice! after 10 mins we went to the room and we found a leaking water from the ceiling. they did not change our room,and not maintenance has been done. | but you probably cannot believe of this...the day after we had a breakfast and after have got an order , we went to the buffet just behind our table, times? 2 mins...so i left on the chair just in the corner my i-phone 6, cigarette and zippo lighter, pushed my chair close to the table and after 2/3mins all my items were gone!!!! after investigation and after asking to the only customer present in the room, the manager and my partner went to downstairs in the lockers room for the hotel's staff to check if at this point someone has stolen my items, and unbelievable, my phone was on top of a locker. | well investigation has been done by the police, we did a complain a follow the correct procedure with the police officers. that is unacceptable. hotel expensive, staff really unkind that by the way steals personal items just under your nose... i have no more words sorry. just please if you are planning yo stay here...do not leave unattended nothing, even for a minute.'''",0

A To Z Hotel,"'''horrible hotel. the only positive moment is the bed that is good. we took a room with bathroom, so we expected to have a shower. well, there was a shower, but without water (i cannot call 1l/min a water flow). the room was cleaned every day, but not very responsibly. breakfast ok, the coffee is terrible. situation: 15 min of fast walk from the tube station ""acton town"" (zone 3) which is about 30-40min by tube from the center (directly). there is a station nearer but you should change the lines somewhere. if you are going for 5 days or so it is better to take an abonnement. during 5 days making just round trips to the center and back on tube we spent 30 pounds while the abonnement will cost 35 pounds. | you may say that i have got what i have paid for. maybe, but next time i would better spend some more for a normal hotel but less for transport. in paris for example for exactly the same amount of money you get a comfortable hotel 2min from metro with normal shower etc.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''having booked a return flight and hotel package to stay at the mondrian hotel, the least i expected after a 13 hours flight was to be greeted by the hotel telling me that the studio room i had fully paid for was not ready. the alternative that the person at the reception offered was to have a more spacious room at an additional charge of gbp140 per night, or being downgraded to a superior room that has no bath tub. her matter-of-fact attitude should not happen in the hospitality industry, and especially at the mondrian, which has so many good reviews, and based on which i chose this hotel to stay for the first time. this seemed to be an extremely dishonest way of sales, with complete misrepresentation on the airline holiday package website. very disappointed with the non-readiness on mondrian's part in not preparing for an overseas guest whom they were well aware of the flight times. not impressed at all even before i could see the room or the hotel facilities.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''did we stay in a different hotel... the name and address are the same so perhaps not, but i cannot believe the good reviews. we stayed one night in april, the room and bathroom was so dated, shabby, grubby, dingy and depressing that we asked to be moved before we unpacked. the dirty window overlooked a dank shaft containing various plant/pipes/cigarette butts etc. we were willing to pay more to change rooms but none were available and it was too late to arrange another hotel. i felt robbed and had to complain but nothing could be done. | i have stayed in four london hotels so far this year and this is the only one i am dissatisfied with. | i imagine - from reading other reviews - some of the hotel rooms must have been refurbished, so my advice is if you do choose to stay here, you must check you will have an updated room. or check in early enough to check out again before you have to sleep there.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''i stayed here overnight on a business trip after failing to get a room elsewhere. | the building inside felt like to need major refurbishment. there was a mixture of damp and air freshener smell from the carpet underneath. floors were squeaky on walking, meaning that night sleep could be disturbed by other guest walking in the corridor. | the bed was fair but the pillows were uncomfortable. the toilet was shared and one had to walk along the corridor and go down half a flight of stairs to access the bathroom which was not the cleanest either. | may not be suitable for families with children and not the best for business trips but ok for having a roof over one's head, bed and breakfast. | breakfast was ok and the staff were kind and tried to please.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''we stayed here in an ensuite room during paralympics &amp; from reviews did not expect too much,-just a sleep, shower and breakfast. room &amp; breakfast ok but absolutely no hot water-so cold shower only &amp; toilet not enough pressure to flush properly! when we complained that our 'ensuite' was not working &amp; asked for a partial refund the receptionist was very arrogant &amp; unco-operative &amp; said it was not 'their fault' as the electrics had overloaded &amp; tripped out the boiler!!! although he said he had reset it the water was still cold. he was also arguing with the postman about signing for mail. we gave up the discussion after a while, there was no management available, so we cut our losses &amp; went to games where the atmosphere could not have been more different. this hotel could do with some customer service training and close inspection of the electrical maintenance. if you decide to stay here be prepared-you may be lucky but you may not.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i went to london for my birthday and after a wonderful meal at rules and some shopping was really looking forward to a pre dinner drink at the beaufort bar. the savoy site clearly states that it does not open before 5.30 and does not operate a reservation system. however, we arrived at 5.20 pm to avoid disappointment. we were told at reception that the bar did not open until 5.30. however, at 5.30 we were informed that all tables had been taken and that there was a 40 minute waiting time. to make matters worse we were told that bar opened at 5.00. | not impressed!!!'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''have spent month traveling to and from london. is not a city known for service but a few places, like the covent garden really make the stay feel special. not here! noise from construction is unbearable, keys are often inoperable, room service orders come sloppily and late. there are staff that try to be helpful, the spa is wonderful but the actual experience of staying at hotel is rather stressful. | also many of the guests have bodyguards and security, is very odd to feel challenged and unwelcome as you enter building.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i stayed at the savoy for the jubilee weekend last year and unfortunately i was very ill and had been unable to post this until now. the savoy seems to have lost the fine politeness that it had along with hotels such as the dorchester. there were soaking wet towells at the front of the hotel. we had to cut our stay short because i was taken to hospital. we agreed with reception that our driver could call and pick up the luggage the following day, but when he arrived they refused to give the luggage to him. it was lucky they could get through on the phone otherwise we would not have been able to collect our luggage. i think the savoy needs to adopt a les brash and more courteous and refined way of dealing with problems. they could learn a lot by looking at some of the other quality hotels in london.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we were close by and fancied a cocktail so we decided to give the northall bar another try despite having a bad experience a few years ago, well never again... the bar was fairly empty and had plenty of waiting staff in view, we were in fairness approached very quickly by a very nice waitress who took the order and brought some nibbles, the problem is that we had to wait at least 20 minutes for the drinks to arrive, another couple arrived after us, sat at the bar and got their drinks before, they just simply forgot us while the barman was busy polishing his glasses. they knew that happened as the waitress apologised for the wait when the drinks eventually arrived. although the drinks looked good (photo attached) one, the ""let the sunshine"" was so tart, it was like drinking pure lemon juice. it is not acceptable for a so called 5 star property to have such lack of customer service, if you know you did not deliver then you should try to recover as opposed to just say sorry with little meaning. | also, when you get to pay by card, the employee hands you the machine taking you through stages of leaving gratuity (after a 12.5% service on the bill)... how can you call this 5 star??? i call this taking guests for a ride... never again!'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''i did not have high hopes entering this hotel, i would read up on tripadvisor previously and was aware of the bad reviews, and even still i was highly disappointed. upon arrival the owner tried to argue with me rather than welcoming me-i queried as i thought i would already paid, he quickly snapped back ""no! no! no! you have not paid, you pay now, or you leave!"". so we were not off to a pleasant start at the a to z hotel. | upon entering our room, the floors were covered in stains of a questionable nature, there were toenail clipping on the floor, the room reeked of fried chicken (thanks to the chicken shop, read breakfast room next door adjacent to the room). on top of this we discovered 17 ""noodle snack"" brand pot noodles hidden in a drawer, along with 7 energy drinks. clearly this room was not cleaned prior to us staying in it. | it is in a bad location far away from central london. | this was a good weekend spoiled by a terrible choice in hotel. | do not make the same mistake i did. go somewhere else.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed there for my wife's 50th birthday. we had a suite for 2 nights at a cost of 900. being residents for the weekend you would think you would be able to use the hotel amenities and by that i mean the bars, but no, we were refused entry to the rumpus bar and the only bar we were allowed in, you had to book to get somewhere to sit. this was absolute crap, you portray yourselves as a top level london hotel, well your certainly not that. i would not stay there again and would not recommend staying there to anybody else. look after your residential guests first.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed here one night -april 1, 2017. the hotel room and halls are run down. there is some sort of air deodorizer machine in the hall. our room was called the beauchamp suite. it was 615.00 (gpb). the room was tiny and dilapidated and i accidently dropped a bobby pin and therefore i saw under the sink and it was one of the grossest things i have ever seen in a hotel room. disgusting and unbelievable that this is a five star room and what i paid to sleep in it for a night.'''",0
City View Hotel,"'''i booked this hotel for the marathon weekend and assumed that the hiked up price of 129 for a ""basic"" hotel was for this reason. as it was somewhere to lay our heads before the marathon, i was happy with ""basic"". i was not happy with dirty though. when i asked a passerby if they knew the way to the hotel, i should have guessed on it is quality when they stifled a laugh. on first impressions from the outside, it looked a little like hostel and a shabby one at that. inside, it was basic and the reception demanded the money up front - they only accepted cash and this was not made clear beforehand. a cash machine that charged for transactions was in the reception area and i reluctantly used it to pay the 129.00 for the family room. she did not have any change and without asking she said, ""get the 1 later"". i had little choice but did not get the change back later! | the room, was not awful to look at, it was a family room and was quite roomy. it did have horrible fluorescent lights though and no decoration whatsoever. there were some added decoration left by the previous occupants however: some dried urine on the toilet seat, a toothpaste box left under a bed and some purple rings left on the top of the fridge, all of which lead me to believe that it had not been cleaned at all.basic is one thing but dirty is another! | for breakfast, we asked for cereal and some toast. at this request, the man brought out two bowls of cornflakes filled with milk. perfect if you like cornflakes, not if you had some other type of cereal or choice at all in mind. there were other options available but we did not have time to sample them - breakfast was at 8, a little late for our plans. | overall, even at the price for the marathon weekend, it was not a great place to stay and the area was not pleasant. we had originally planned to bring our children but i am extremely glad we did not. it was fairly close to stations but no nice restaurants.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''we stayed in february, wanting to love it. the room was lovely...the bathroom was full of marble....and we went to bed in a luxurious bed. sadly, when the room next door came back for the night and put on cnn we could hear every word. a good night's sleep is a given in a hotel.... but no sound proofing between rooms? reception offered to move us, but we settled on them asking next door to switch the tv off. sadly it went on again at 6.30 am......'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''we were expecting a kingsize bed and a fridge - but the room had a std double bed and no fridge. the hotel was vey busy, &amp; when we checked-in we heard another guest being told he could not have the grand room he had booked and he was offered a smaller room instead, so it suggests you may not get the room you have booked. the room was ok, but very noisy as it overlooked the main road, and the windows did not fit properly. the flush on the toilet frequently did not work - it had to be pumped up &amp; down. | the room was small and the tv was fixed on the wall at the bottom of the bed. and, as there was only about 2ft between the bottom of the bed and the wall, the tv stuck out - with the result that i banged my head on the tv, when i got up in the night! | the breakfast was very good - apart from the coffee, which was very stewed and weak- do not be fooled by the wonderful aroma of freshly roast coffee, as you walk into the dining room at breakfast-time. | the hotel was very convenient for the v&amp;a, science museum etc - or for harrods and the shops of knightsbridge.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''my sister, mum and i arrived from australia, took a cab to the rembrandt, ready to surprise mum with beautiful accommodation (one twin room and one single) for her 80th birthday. on arrival we were told we had no reservation and they did not cater for twin share at all in the hotel. after phoning our travel agent, who insisted that we did have bookings, and after showing our reservation vouchers and details again, the hotel offered us a room with a double bed, saying that two of us would have to share it for the week. the room was lovely, but the proposition was not. the staff were completely unhelpful and in the end our travel agent had to find us a room at another hotel, which was frankly a huge disappointment. we travelled in june 2011.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i will start with what was good about this hotel. the location is terrific. the south kensington tube station is a block and a half away, harrods, etc. are about 3-4 blocks the other direction. the v&amp;a museum is literally across the street, so it was nice to walk over for the day. knightsbridge / kensington are two of the nicest areas in the center of london. the music academy is a block away, so there are always great performances to attend without having to travel very far. it is a great neighborhood. | from the moment we checked into the rembrandt, it seemed as though the desk staff had something more important to do (and we had just spent the previous 3 weeks in italy, so our tolerance for 'abrupt' treatment from hotel staff was pretty high). aside from one nice man who loaned us an extension cord and some of his tools to fix a suitcase, the staff was just plain rude. | our room had once been beautiful. it was large and had a nice sitting area that overlooked the v&amp;a museum. the condition of the room, however was a far cry from 'shabby chic'. the carpet was worn and stained, the furniture was worn nearly through in many places, and both the furniture and the feather mattress pad and duvet had a musty smell. | there was so much deferred maintenance that i cannot list it all, but the main thing that stands out in my mind is that the mini-bar fridge had not been cleaned in a long time, and with the key-card system the hotel uses to shut down electricity in the room having turned off the power, smelled slightly of wet cat. the bathroom sink drain was slow, the ironing board would not stand up. you get the idea. once a hotel experience turns, as this one did, the list of things one notices gets longer and longer :) | after the first breakfast, we vowed to walk to other food. the buffet reflected the same lack of care as the rest of the presentation. we just kept asking ourselves, ""does anybody care that things are like this?"". the answer is that if someone did, they would not be. | when we went to the front desk to express a few concerns, the young lady (without realizing that i could see what she was writing) while listening to my partner describe our concern, smiled and wrote down a completely different number (while repeating it back). when i repeated the number, she realized i was standing where i could see her notepad, blushed, scribbled it out and wrote the number down. it spoke to the lack of concern for us or any customer, and we were not going on like i am right now, it was something as simple as a request for a room key because housekeeping had taken ours out of the key-card slot. | this hotel could be a great find, with just a little tlc and a tightening of the managerial reigns. location is one thing, but an absence of pride is another. while it was not the worst hotel room we have seen, we will definitely seek other accommodations in the future.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''we were there because our friend gave us a voucher with one spa-champagne-night-breakfast. we spent more than a month to find a date to use it. we even suggest use it in more than 6 month away, but or they do not have the specific room or they do not know if the spa will be open. | finally, we manage a date. when we arrive the receptionist did not know which voucher we were using! (and we made the booking directly in the hotel showing the voucher). | he said he should ask, it was ok for us. | so we went to the spa. afer that we asked again if the voucher was ok or not. the said there was no problem. | what surprise the next morning! when we did our check out, the new receptionist said he does not know anything about the voucher. after speak with several people, finally he said the voucher only is for the room. we show him an email from the dorchester hotel which explain that the voucher include everything spa-champagne-room-breakfast, he again spent sometime asking. after some people, they said everything was ok. | but here the most horrible moment, when a week ago i see in my credit card a charge from dorchester hotel of everything!!!!!!!!!! | after several emails to the hotel and the voucher agent, they refunded my money, after a month!!!!! | one night in the dorchester hotel, i am still remember the headache of all these things. | hopefully, we had the money to pay it and we live in london to do all these staff easily.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''booked a spa day here for a special friends birthday. quite possibly the worst spa experience ever imagined - it is actually criminal to call it a ""spa""! (note never went into the hotel - i am sure it is lovely!) | the ""relaxation area"" was a balcony overlooking a tiny pool with around 100 screaming kids - the noise was so loud you had to shout to one another. in this ""relaxation area"" there was only 2 lounge beds cramped against walls and then a couple chairs floating around so everyone had to stand. | the changing rooms had the saunas in so do not be thinking you can share with a member of the opposite sex - obviously this is great if you come as a couple! also there were kids clothes drying on the seats in the sauna room so you could not use them anyway. | the staff were not bothered as they are really just there to cater the gym crowd every day. it took a lot of hassling them to speak to anyone in charge. at first we were offered an asprin and a free glass of wine - very nice but i was expecting something a bit more ""luxurious"" from a famous hotel. | overall a very poor ""gym spa experience"" and was clearly an afterthought of the hotel - just a way they could make a few extra dollars rather than designing something that actually is a good product and gives what a spa should - relaxation!'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''stayed here many times both for business and pleasure, alone, with my wife and even with extended family and children. it is in fact impossible to seperate the business and pleasure stays because everytime was a breathtakingly delectable pleasure. meeting friends and colleagues whether in the lobby one of the resturants always left an impressive memorable impression. alas, i have not been able to visit again for sometime - either fully booked or are not able to guarantee convenient parking for my personal chauffeur and car.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''clean and modern rooms, tidy and pleasant and i guess an expected rate for a good central location. be careful when upgrading to superior , the only difference is a city view. so why a low score? on arrival we were told our room was not ready but we could upgrade to a room with a river view and king size bed for another 150 and the room was ready now, what they really meant was pay another 150 and you can have a room now or pay nothing and wait until the advertised check in time. i read a number of reviews all mentioning staff by name, i saw nothing of this , they were pleasant enough but nothing special. my main issue was that i was not aware my room did not include breakfast. when we went for breakfast we were not told it was not included and was then charged an additional 45 for the pleasure. surely if it is not included the staff should state you can eat but how much it will be ?? this point seemed lost of the reception staff when checking out, the lady called the manager who continued to argue with me stating i should of known and then asking how much i was willing to pay !! nothing was my response and eventually he agreed. i am sorry, i am a fair person and this was simply unreasonable.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''sigh...where to start?! room contained a double bed, one nightstand (with only small top drawer), writing desk (also with only one usable small top stationery drawer), chair, closet to hang shirts and t.v. (on top of the minibar cabinet). hmmmm...what seems to be missing? oh, yes. a bureau/dresser with drawers to hold your clothing and other items! i was truly living out of my suitcase for my week's stay! not fun, as each day i came back to the room with more souvenirs, and no place to put them but back into my suitcase. additionally, the bathroom sink faucet could not mix the hot and cold waters. trying to get cool water, i could feel both the hot and cold water streams coming out of the faucet unmixed. add to that a non-adjustable thermostat - where your only room temperature choices were 'cool', 'cold', 'warm' and 'hot' - and the 'high speed wifi' that was advertised was non-existent. no speed wifi was more like it - web pages took forever to load, if they ever did. and this was in both my room and on the hotel's computer (by the way, a) only two guest computers for a hotel this size?! b) their printer was also broken during my week's stay). wifi was so slow i had to have the concierge check me in on his computer for my flight home. | double bed was right next to one wall with literally one foot of space between the right side of the bed and the wall. thus, you could not walk along the right side of the bed without walking sideways. add to that the fact that my phone went dead one day, and twice the television just shut off for no apparent reason and you have a fair idea of what i was dealing with. on the other hand, at least reception sent up the maintenance man in a timely manner. | the receptionists and room service staff were friendly and helpful, but the concierges seemed uninterested in their job and exhibited no sense of friendliness or true helpfulness. i do not expect them to 'suck up' to guests, but a simple smile, a friendly 'hello, how can i help you?' goes a long way in making a hotel stay pleasant. | i wish my stay at this hotel was happier, as i love london, and had two wonderful stays previously at the dorset square hotel. but the cliche is true - you get what you pay for.'''",0

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''my original review of the ridgemount hotel was removed on the grounds that we did not stay the night and therefore i should not have reviewed, for example, the hotels sleep quality. i find it ironic that i am not permitted to review a hotel in terms of sleep quality when the roomand the mattress in particularfacilities were so poor that staying overnight was impossible. | i have stayed in all sorts of hotels/motels/inns/converted barns/hostels all over the world, and never have i not found something to love about the room. not so the ridgemount hotel, which was so reminiscent of my long-ago volunteer days in a tragic psychiatric facility (now closed) in ontario, we had to leave the hotel despite our having paid for four nights in a row. | to begin, the stuffy room was smaller than a prison cell, and, as i said, about as cheerful. the noise from the street below was immediately overwhelming, and there was no room to unpack our luggage. worse, the chair was unsittably lumpy and the bed so uncomfortable we had nowhere to sit or lie down except on the toilet. while it is true we were unable to stay the night, i laid on the bed (or tried to) long enough to know that getting up from it was nearly impossible. my son and partner did the same thing, because i worried i was being unfair. we all came to the same conclusion: the mattress was horrible. | my son (we had booked him into a room on the lower floor), rolled a water bottle along the floor, the two of us gobsmacked by the threatening angle/s. in fact, the floors/carpet were such a hilly mess, we could barely walk across the tiny room. it was like living inside of an escher print. the discrepancy between the height of the bed at the bottom versus the top was shocking (we measured, incredulous), and the bare walls and cheap, fluorescent lights capped off the bleakness to such effect i felt close to heartbroken. | my son foraged on for two nights in his cramped room (we all foraged in to compare) below while we moved on, thanks to booking.com, to comparably exquisite surroundings. throughout our stay in london and the yorkshire dales (we walked one of the trails) we stayed in six places, all of them terrific. and as much as i appreciated that the ridgemount could refund only two of our four night reservation, given that the bed was unsittable, i think they ought to have refunded it all. (i knew, actually, as we waited into the front room to be admitted to our rooms, that things were askew, given that we practically fell into the sad chairs, whose springs must have died years ago.) | my son said that the breakfasts were edible and the people friendly, but that he was kept awake in his hot, street-level room by inebriated young people who lined the street in front of his room and who were guests of the ridgemount hotel.'''",0
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''let us start with the customer service 0/5 laughable even the lady at reception charged double (60) for the deposit then when i challenged her she took off 30 then emptied our mini bar, i then challenged her again and she admitted her mistake and refilled our mini bar, which was time wasted before i even had a chance to enjoy the hotel, boring hotel, the area is dead nothing around is open being a business area we slightly expected that on the weekend, the view from our balcony was nothing to shout about, i would not recommended staying here they still have not given me back the money for the deposit which was said to take 48 hours, after phoning them countless times you soon see their staff are not ready to deal with any negativity, nervous laughs and passing the buck was their only tactics, awful experience, cheers apex.'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i stayed here whilst on business, first impressions were that the reception areas needed a lick of paint, the greeting was friendly and efficient, my room was a large room with a double bed a single bed and a bunk bed, which had recently been decorated, the shower room was new and modern, what let this place down is the breakfast room it small and poky, my coffee when i was asked if i wanted one was almost thrown across the table, the variety was small and the staff were uninterested, one i believe was the owner!! i will not use this hotel again!!'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''the hotel is superb, one of the best i have ever stayed in. built in the 30's but do not expect art deco , there are some glimpses of inter war modernism but mostly the style is luxurious and classic. my only real gripe is that the stay was bought as a present by a voucher. i rang many months in advance but could not secure a saturday with the voucher so settled for a friday instead. however, out of curiosity i looked on various websites and the same room could have been booked for my requested saturday. i suppose the brunei investment vehicle that owns the hotel needs to maximise revenue. just be aware if buying an experience for a loved one that you may not get quite what you want.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''went to the dorchester last night for a drink in the bar which is straight ahead of you as you walk in the front entrance. i was really disappointed to find the bar staff to be surly, unfriendly and did not once raise a smile. we were not offered a drinks menu, we had to ask for it and it was practically thrown at me. my partner order me a spicy margarita and the barman did not ask what my partner wanted just assumed he was having the same. which he was not. i do not understand why they had to be so unfriendly especially as the price we paid for 2 drinks with 40!!! i was however impressed with the pianist and his band members as they were ever so friendly and even played a song dedicated to me, which was really sweet. shame the bar staff were not the same. so we then headed off the the grosvenor hotel which was a welcome change as we were immediately welcomed by there staff and made to feel wanted.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''globally i am not satisfied with my stay in this hotel, it is expensive but the service is lacking, like the minibar was never refilled on cereal bars, on one day i found a paper from some medication after the maid cleaned the room, then at the boulud bar, the guy at the entrance let us wait for more than 45mn for a table that was available, later offered not to invoice two glass of champaign that we took, but still invoiced them, the day after i came back and told him i was not satisfied with the situation and he said he would took care of me, i only took one small plate of charcuterie and one glass of wine (total cost around 20 pounds compared to the 36 pounds of the two glasses of billecart), when the invoice arrived the charcuterie was not removed | the spa was full apparently with no specific reservation slots for the hotel guests, then when i left i had a hard time removing the internet charges even tough i have a small world card which specify they should not be invoiced and even tough i did not use the credit i had for a dinner or lunch at boulud (valued at 100 pounds) | later i received an email with the invoice of the internet charges (36 pounds) because i should have reserved through a small world which is a club and not a reservation center. | i was also supposed to get an upgrade with my platinum amex package but my room was small and smelling old. | the dinner by heston blumenthal restaurant and breakfast are nice tough. | for such a high price they are much better options in london, where you will not have the feeling that the hotel is expensive and the people running it cheap.'''",0

The Savoy,'''we took afternoon tea for two during the christeas break. the teapots were tarnished and covered in water drip marks. one plate had a small bit of dried on food on it. the waiter spilt tea on the tablecloth at the very beginning of the service. i asked if one of the sandwich flavours could be changed for one of the others on the menu. the reply was i am sure your husband can eat any you do not want. and then after eating the sandwiches was offered more of any flavour. so why could not we have one swapped at the outset? the sandwiches and scones were delicious. the pastries were gorgeous. the waiter did not know if the hazelnuts in the roulade went all the way through the cake or were just on the cream topping and did not ask a colleague. the brioche fruit cake had been left uncovered for at least the last two hours and was extremely dry and unpalatable. i asked for a fresh pot of tea 45 minutes after it was brought to the table and was told it was fresh and he did not bring another. the fabric on the arms of the chairs had worn through in places. finally the hinge on the loo seat was broken. the bottom line is that afternoon tea at the savoy is not an experience it is a process. this was given to us as a present and after six months anticipation we were very disappointed. come on savoy we expected much better!''',0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''dissapointed!!!!!!!! i wish our family was like the many who actually experienced the family room. yes the rates are good for london if you are a family but i would have preferred to be told that the ""real"" family room was not available and that what we were being offered had liitle to no room and was not really suitable for a family. after trying the room for a hour or tow and then asking if more was available i was made to feel uncomfortable by the gentleman to the point we made sure we spent as little time as possible at the hotel. | our family was mum and three teenagers housed in a room with a double and bunks. the owner was informed of the childrents ages at booking time. except for on the double bed there was not a space to even open a suitcase. we would go outside to the corridor open our case and get what we wanted, leave the case outside locked untill we went out or to bed and then bring them in. if there was a fire in the night i could not imagine getting our easily as we would have to fall over each other as well as suitcases. needless to say you could not even walk between the beds. add on the fact that the famly room is on the top floor with a small staircase then make sure your family is all capable of going up and down themselves or mum and dad will be tired. | put this aside the hotel was very clean. water in the bathroom hot. the breakfast room on the other hand was very cold. if you intend to spend any time dinning than make sure you wear your coat. maybe this is so you do not stay long and eat much. the breakfast was very average. not your typical continental breakfast at all. the service was quick and friendly howerver unfortunately the room was so cold that by the time you spead your honey on your toast it was cold. | i guess basically not a great experience. out of seven weeks of travell through europe and england this was our biggest dissapointment. does not compare at all to other hotels. | locations is excellent. lots of easy access to anywhere in london. lots of local resturants, corner stores for bits and pieces and a laundry close by.'''",0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''before you read my review, i urge you to read other one-to-three star reviews of this hotel. the staff problems here are endemic. | most complain about the utterly shocking customer service, followed by a pat response from sergio, general manager, about how disappointed he is to hear this. | someone is not doing their job properly here or addressing the problems in an effective | way and it is not the customers. | to be clear - sergio, you are not doing your job correctly. | the staff give the poorest customer service i have ever encountered in any hotel anywhere in the world. they are surly, aloof and disinterested across the board. sergio clearly is not addressing this problem or maybe it is a reflection on his attitude to customer service but either way, the mondrians reputation is on the line. the hotel is aesthetically pleasing on the eye but the good stuff ends there. it took 20 minutes to order a drink in the rooftop bar and also the ground floor bar, each time delivered by deeply uninterested staff. | upon asking for a cappuccino at breakfast, the waiter sniggered derisively. a seemingly acceptable request met with an unacceptably rude response. he genuinely could not be bothered getting one. i could go on. and on and on. | how many more reviews about staff behaviour must this hotel receive to confront the problem?? i do not want a pat response from the general manager to this review but an actual addressing of the issues that plague this hotel. i stay in a different hotel every week of my life all over the world and this is the absolute worst service i have ever had the misfortune to encounter. | to the board and owners of the mondrian -you need to look into these problems you have at this hotel. the deficiencies are so great that it overshadows the beautiful views and design. its style over substance at present, to the power of ten. i came away feeling like id been robbed and id spent a lot of money taking friends on this stay. despicable service and a terminal staff training problem at this residence. | avoid at all costs. see the pat response from sergio below and ignore.'''",0

(there was loads of grime in the bathrooms which obviously were not cleaned as often as in most hotels. anyway; we had nowhere else to go. we were stuck.) we knew to expect basic; the price being the same as an ibis budget we had stayed in on the south coast. but there seemed to be lots of extra cost cutting - in two rooms the fans did not work but were just ornamental; perhaps to save electricity, like the non-functioning bedside lights in one room. the owner himself was friendly enough in his bumbling way; he did unblock one basin when the water did not drain. we had two rooms; the one facing the street was noisy and i could only sleep with ear plugs. in the morning, breakfast was self service. literally. there were no staff on hand at breakfast. one had to figure out everything oneself -like finding a clean plate, as many of them were not properly washed, finding milk in the fridge, making cordial (not real juice), instant coffee or tea and toast. at the end you had to stack your dirty dishes in a single small sink out the back, if you did not want to inflict even more trauma on any poor fellow traveller who arrived later by leaving a table dirty. there was a lot of cameraderie among the guests; we exchanged jokes about how we had never come across anything so bad, and discussed what worked or did not work in our individual rooms. check-out consisted of putting one's keys in a slot; the owner was nowhere to be seen, the ""desk"" was unmanned in the morning. the most enjoyment was chatting with the other guests at breakfast, and imagining possible tripadvisor entries: tired of the bland corporatism of ibis budget? looking for character, excitement and adventure? willing to take risks? here is a hotel with stories to dine out on!'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the hotel is tired and in desperate for a refurbishment, the rooms are so dated, poor service, had a leaking toilet so had a to paddle through waiter to use the bathroom, reported this and guess what the same problem the next night, the chef, sorry rephrase, cook had no clue how to poach an egg after two attempts still rock hard!! the breakfast buffet was a mess berries all mushed together, and had to ask to be served empty plates just left in front of us both. | verdict, no one cares. | will not be back ever. | try the savoy best breakfast and service ever.'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''smelly. small. grotty. 3 words best describing this place. there is a lovely looking man-hole cover just outside the front door which leads to the sewers, and i was considering popping that bad boy open and kipping down there for the night when i saw the room. it absolutely stunk of cannabis when we arrived, the room is smaller than one of those tin slum houses you see in third world documentaries, and the sink is really close to the toilet which makes it a bit uncomfortable to have a poo... fresh skids already in the toilet bowl was the least of my worries; climbing into bed revealed scratchy sheets &amp; a lumpy sexed out mattress, which in turn caused me to have the worst sleep of my life. | there was no soap provided in the room, but in hindsight i do not think there was any form of soap anywhere on the premises. i only noticed this when already in the shower which was a bit annoying, as my left arm fell victim to the shower curtain: this polyester sheet was absolutely caked in slimy mould, i was cleaner before having a shower for christ's sake. the whole experience was traumatic. | the next morning the dreaded 'continental breakfast' (which, might i add, i avoided after seeing the food prep area). the fridge was covered in mould and there was greasy pans left on the cooker since what looked like 1998. you literally get a couple of slices of toast &amp; drink. that is it. i opted for a glass of 'orange juice' before leaving, and even this made my stomach churn; it was not by any stretch of the imagination orange juice. it was very very cheap orange squash, and when i put the glass up to my mouth i got a smell that resembled bum holes, and a taste of disappointment and bacteria. | the only positive part of this stay was the bloke on reception, friendly but not the faked retail friendly you get in shops, him and the women in the god awful breakfast room/a to z restaurant - so if for some reason you end up there by accident say hi, turn around, run to west acton tube station (trains only run every half hour or so from acton main line), and do not look back. maybe grab something from sainsbury's just over the road to wash the taste of bacteria squash from your mouth though.'''",0
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''this is the second time i have visited this hotel. the first time, approximately 7 months ago there were a couple of minor issues which i put down to the hotel being new and coming together, but i am sorry to say i was very disappointed with my last trip. | i want to love this place. it is in a fabulous location, the hotel decor is ultra-stylish and the beds are to die for, i would go as far as to say the most comfortable i have ever slept in. this place could be amazing.... so why the low score. | the most important thing, in my opinion when it comes to staying in a hotel of any category is the level of service you receive. | firstly, i spoke to the concierge on both occasions i stayed prior to my visit. the first time my dinner reservation had not been made when we arrived at our chosen venue (this may have been the restaurant so i cannot entirely blame concierge). the second time i found the whole experience hard work as the person could not understand what i was saying (i am english). i had to keep repeating myself and after all the hard work &amp; frustration never got the reservation we wanted anyway. | check in was ok although both times i have booked there has been a glitch on the names and one time we were taking a client and it was fairly embarrassing as they kept getting his name the wrong way round despite me emailing the exact requirement. | next issue. we called down to house keeping to see if they could collect a white shirt off the the chair in our room and have it ironed and returned by a certain time. we returned to our room after shopping and the unironed shirt remained untouched on the chair. my blue &amp; yellow dress which had been on the bed had however disappeared and re-emerged in the wardrobe all in wrapping. this had obviously been the item they had ironed. hilarious as it did not in the slightest require ironing and how can they get a blue and yellow dress on the bed mixed up with a white shirt on a chair? i must note though that they did come back up and the problem was rectified. | breakfast was a disaster and quite painful. cold eggs, maple syrup instead of chocolate sauce for pancakes which they eventually replaced, after the other 3 diners had finished. tea poured before it had brewed then ages to replace a cup. staff disinterested an unapologetic. then they tried to charge us for the appalling experience when breakfast was included in our room rate. this held us up! | i will sadly not be visiting this hotel again unless there are a lot of changes, which is such a shame as there were elements to it i loved. this is one of the most expensive hotels in london and is not deserved of the rates ... not the service charge they add on to your room bill at the end ... tut tut'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i made my reservations through centurion american express as it is said to be one of their best london properties through the fine hotels &amp; resorts program. my wife and i travel a great deal and are always prepared to pay for a 5+ star hotel as the service and experiance usually go hand-and-hand with the price one expects to pay...not here. you will pay but will not receive the according service or experiance. this hotel clearly is ridding on their name plate, location, and former laurels. i love london and would recommend so many other fine hotels (41, covent garden) but recomend saving your money as i would not stay here again at any price. sevice - rude, arrogant, disinterested: rooms - in need of total refurbishment, bathrooms stark, old, awful layout &amp; design: f&amp;b - better anywhere outside of hotel as london has some of the best food finds around these days. mandarin london wants to be the mandarin miami when it grows up (but seemingly will not).'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i have eaten in the river room at the savoy several times, but never in the grill, so a first for us. sooo disappointing! mediocre overpriced food. did not complain as we were with friends who seem to think it was ok. the savoy is a beautiful hotel, but i feel since their (superb) renovation they have sold out to a group. if you want a truly five star london experience i do not think you can beat claridges.'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''firstly - i have been a big fan of the dorchester collection. the bel air is my fav hotel in the world, and i have stayed at most of their hotels - except the dorchester itself. so, for a special birthday i spent an overnight in a king deluxe park view and we also booked a table at the china tang restaurant. and i am disappointed to report that the visit was poor to say the least. we had to wait to check-in, and when we eventually got to the front - we were asked if it was a special occasion and we told the receptionist it was a birthday - although the hotel did absolutely nothing to recognise this during the stay - so i have no idea why we were asked. we were taken to the room which was fine, but as the photos testify - there was a cigarette burn mark on the curtains and in quite a few places damage around the window. i know it is an old grand dame of a hotel - but this kind of poor room management would be unthinkable at claridges or the connaught - both large hotels of the same age. more shocks were to come - we were left on hold for over 5 minutes waiting for room service, who took 45 mins to deliver hot water, the mirror in the bathroom was damaged, the window also would not close properly, high speed wifi was 20 for 24 hours (shocking), valet parking was 60, and the china tang was almost industrial in its approach to catering - and so noisy. after yet another long wait to check out to pay 1000 for less than 24 hours, we left massively disappointed that the flagship of the hotel group is more like the titanic!'''",0
The Savoy,"'''my wife and i stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary. at reception we were greeted by a very personal check-in experience and were initially told that our room was not ready, despite our understanding that it should be ready from 12pm. after we suggested that, we were informed that, indeed, a room was available after all. the room itself was quite small (probably our fault for choosing one of the entry level rooms, i use quotation marks as we still spent more than 550 on the room alone) and immediately above the hotel entrance, despite the massive bathroom it definitely did not feel luxurious. after settling in we were greeted by a lovely surprise: a slice of cake to help us celebrate our anniversary and some biscuits celebrating the royal wedding. unfortunately, it seemed like the biscuit box was taken from someone elses room as the harry biscuit had been eaten and the larger heart shaped biscuit had been partially eaten. we complained and were sent another box, but for a hotel of this standing and the price we paid we expected much more. that evening, after we got back from a show at around 23:30 we tried to go for a drink at the bar, only to be told that it closed at 23:00 but that there might be another bar open within the hotel. we went over to the other side where some live music was being played and were told that the bar was full, and that it was also closing (the young lady who was hosting unfortunately forgot to mention that there was a separate bar just around the corner, and within earshot of the live music, that stayed open until 1am). we spoke to the porters and tried our luck with another local hotel bar with a rooftop, only to be told that it was only open for guests. we therefore trooped back to the savoy, thoroughly disheartened and a little upset, but upon telling the porters that the other hotel bar would not let us in, one of them took it upon himself to march us past the young lady who had told us that the bar was not open to the one around the corner that was indeed open. so top marks to the porter but a pretty poor experience from the savoy that we needed his help. | therefore, overall, our stay at the savoy was not worth the money and we would not be able to recommend it to others, especially those that are looking for an unforgettable experience to help them celebrate a special event.'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we have stayed at the mo london preferentially for years, but we had two horrible experiences in 2012 and i will never go back. the rooms have never been great, but we have always gone for the service. | on the last trip in may we encountered so many problems that i wrote to the manager who assured me it was a lapse in service and that it would not happen again. (bad service, smoking room, over- charging, the list goes on) so we decided to go back for a couple of days at xmas. | why so woeful, you ask? | the room we started in had couches outside our door. they were strangely arranged in the small corridor. every time we came back to the room there were people sitting outside our door and shoes strewn everywhere up and down the hall. the women on the lounges had kettles and food. i asked the manager what was going on. he asked if they we making noise. i just said i did not feel safe with people camped outside. anyway when cornered it conspires that the whole floor apart from our room was constantly booked by a large middle eastern family who treat it as home and the nannies/ personal staff have to sit silently out of their way when not needed. apparently in the access point to the only room on the floor that they did not have!! the hotel moved us to a suite, but it was on the first floor and not my first choice. then we got up early the next morning to use the gym, which now had a large form on the door saying it was closed due to engineering issues. we stormed to the front desk where the manager on duty argued that we had been informed that the gym was shutting. funny, we did not remember the conversation and as we had used the gym the day before, it was a shock! he said everyone had been informed. nope. | the new buffet breakfast makes the restaurant loud and as another reviewer has said, any extras are hugely overpriced. | we will not be back and we have stayed at the hotel so many times and always thought of it as our london base. just woeful now to us.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''took money from my credit card after i left and was told everything was settled. had to contact them and query it. slow service due to lack of staff, felt really bad for the one waitress that was on, we waited 40 minutes for drinks after we would ordered them and about 45 minutes for some sharing platters. breakfast seemed chaotic due to not enough staff such a shame as this hotel was in a great location and rooms were nice. not the kind of service i expect when spending a lot of money.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''we loved the location (knightsbridge, across from the victoria and albert museum, very near harrods and harvey nichols), the pool, the price and enthusiastically booked. while the construction at the front door the management could not help, they could have solved the many other shortcomings, to name a few: | 1. could not order a movie for 2 consecutive nights, something wrong with the system hotel wide | 2. one of the two lifts not working for over 24 hours now | 3. breakfast fried eggs tasted like fish (reusing oil?), there was little fresh fruit, croissants over cooked, coffee cold. i could not get my 12 year old to eat anything but muffins. | 4. lobby and other dcor could be much nicer, empty flower pots in main lobby, just general lack of attention to detail and good management | 5. just went down to the gym at 7.30 and it is closed until 8. no disaster but an inconvenience. | 6. ordered a newspaper that never came | the room itself was an exec room and small but adequate.'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''my worst hotel stay ever. i have stayed in pretty much all the best hotels in the world and have never been treated with such 'miserly' respect. maybe one has to be famous to get the expected 5 star treatment, but when you are paying &gt; $400 for a room, you expect better than that. small queen room, dirty hand marks on the ceiling, rusty screws in the bathroom wall where the telephone ""once"" was. ashtrays and matches in both bedroom and bathroom. but i booked a non-smoking room and confirmed this at check-in. called the front desk and asked if my room was smoking. she said yes. i said, fine, but i specifically requested (at checkin and on reservation form with lhw) a non smoking. | she changed her story and said that the room was in fact non-smoking. | strange!!!! during the previous few hours, i had to bear the noise of kids running around on the floor above us and the loud tv in the bedroom next door. enough was enough. i called for the manager. she came up to the room and admited that in fact it was a smoking room on a smoking floor and could not explain the reception desk's response. nor could she explain why i was on a lower floor despite my reservation request for an upper floor. she told us that she would make it up to us as she saw our displeasure. we returned from dinner and were greeted by the reception manager. he apologized and tried to explain how that room was sometimes a smoking room and sometimes not. unbelievable from a hotel of such supposed reputation and ""expense""!!!!! he moved us to an equally small king room on the 9th floor and offered us a complimentary bottle of wine. with my flight in 6 hours, this is the last gesture i needed. what a feeble way to make it up to us. that was my second stay at that hotel and very much my last!!! four seasons and claridges treat us with a lot more respect.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''after their multi million dollar makeover i had high hopes of a fantastic luxury weekend in london, but was dismayed at what they have done to this once great hotel. gone are the special touches and staff remembering your name. gone is the traditional, almost regal atmosphere. instead we were faced with over the top decor, edging on brash in some areas, together with snooty, young staff who looked like they were straight out of school. the guests it now attracts are loud, new rich, that think the world revolves around them, and that strut around the hotel making noise whoever they go. the food was nothing like it used to be but was expensive. my potatoes were hard and the steak overcooked. the whole meal was a waste of money, so beware when choosing where to dine. i requested a late check out due to a late flight i had, but was told that it was impossible. if this is the way they treat old clients, i hate to think how they treat new ones. disillusioned, disappointed and definitely never returning.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''on arrival at the hotel the entrance area looked reasonable enough but after being shown to our room we were really disappointed. the room was tiny and housed a double bed pushed upgainst the wall, a wardrobe, small chest of drawers and bedside cabinet with missing handles. we were unable to make ourselves a drink due to the state of the inside of the kettle. the room was hot and stuffy with only a very small window the room was ensuite and the bathroom looked relatively new but on turning on the shower both hot and cold taps produced scalding water which prevented us from using the facilities. we requested another room but was told there were no rooms available. as we had booked two nights we decided only to stay the one and cancel the second night. the hotel refused to refund us for the second night even though we had given them 24 hours notice (as indicated on their website). we decided to get out of the hotel at the earliest opportunity and left the following morning without even having breakfast which we were also charged for. i would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone. it was an awful experience and the hotel website did not truly reflect the hotel. another downside was the hotel was opposite the local police station and you can imagine the amount of noise generated everytime a police car left the station with sirens blaring out throughout the night.'''",0

Corinthia Hotel London,'''i treated my daughter to a stay in the corinthia for her birthday present. i booked a deluxe room because they had pink decor on the website and it is her favourite colour. i wrote and specifically asked for this. when they arrived they were given a horrible green room. i feel really annoyed as it was a special occasion. they also took full payment when they arrived and then accused them of not paying and my son in law had to show them his online banking to show it was paid by debit card. they were really embarrassed by the attitude of the front desk staff especially as it was done in front of other customers. also no apology was given when they were proved right which annoyed them even more. | my family have been staying in the ritz in london for twenty years and have always had all requests honoured with friendly staff and no problems. unfortunately l chose this hotel because l thought they would enjoy the spa. i am really disappointed and a junior suite in the ritz would actually have been cheaper. never again.''',0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''my friends and i decided to have some pre drinks at the mandarin hotel, despite their extensive and inconvenient refurbishments, which resulted in an extremely poor service experience. we ordered drinks on arrival, which were very slow considering the bar was nearly empty (6.30pm). our party all arrived by 6.50pm and by 7pm all had a drink. with a dinner reservation 5mins walk from the location we decided to order a round for the road at 7.10pm, thinking 5mins to prepare (considering barely anyone at the bar) and depart at 7.25pm latest for a prompt arrival at dinner. however, the drinks did not arrive and at 7.25pm we had to ask for our bill to depart. the response to this request, from the inexperienced barman, was to speak to his even more inexperienced manager who then confronted us like a doorman to demand that we pay for the drinks that had yet to arrive. we were clearly quite upset at this and his way of trying to calm the situation was to offer to call our restaurant and delay our dinner! we are relaxed people and regrettably agreed to this ludicrous proposal. we finished our drinks, paid in full, arrived late for our onward dinner and late home to our families. for one of london's so called premier establishments, charging premium prices for its service offering, we were extremely disappointed with our experience and would recommend others to avoid the hotel bar of this establishment at the very least.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i have spent a couple of nights in a first floor room on the back. the room was quite spacious (compared to london's standards) and fairly decorated,but the only window was facing the air conditioning compressors and kitchen's air outlet. this made quite impossible to open the window because of the noise &amp; smell. moreover the room was really noisy all night long (air conditioning, bathrooms, doors slammed etc.).'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''we had stayed here previously, nice location and clean modern rooms. so when i was planning a trip with my 85 year old mother i reserved 4 days at the rembrandt. i called 3 times and had my son call from oxford - we would be arriving near midnight and i wanted the room to be ready - alas, we arrived as expected and our pre-paid room was not available. we were transferred to a fleabag location a few blocks away where my mother had to climb a flight of stairs and i had to sleep on a sofa bed. during the transfer my laptop disappeared,. although the hotel gave us partial credit it did not approach the cost of replacing my computer. nor did the housekeeping staff that barely knocked as they opened the door... or the maintenance staff that was in the room, door closed - practically gave me a heart attack when i opened the door to discover 2 men. | there are women, possibly hookers hanging out in the lobby. | this is not a family place. i will never stay here again.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i wanted to do something really special and memorable for my 21st birthday so i saved up some money and was lucky enough to get a little extra as a present and booked a night at the savoy for me and my best friend. upon arriving at the hotel, we were immediately looked down upon and spoken to as if we were lost and not meant to be there. the room package i booked was unclear so despite it being a nice room, it was not what i payed for. | when we went down for breakfast in the morning, the staff in the restaurant were so rude to us and made us feel like absolute crap. i have never been treated so badly in my entire life. they made a judgement on us because of our age and were so patronising and belittling even though we were spending money to be there just like everyone else. a good hotel would treat all of their guests equally, regardless of age, how long they are staying or anything else. the rest of our night in london, which consisted of a fantastic dinner at the diner on strand and seeing the lion king in the theatre, was amazing but is now overshadowed by the awful night at the savoy. | i am embarrassed at my decision to stay here and so wish i had opted for a much cheaper hotel where we probably would have been treated ten times better. now, a night that should have been one i would remember forever is one i prefer to forget. it is really sad how a beautiful hotel with so much history is let down by it is disrespectful staff.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i have stayed here for business and pleasure on at least 6 occasions previously and clearly it has been good enough to keep me coming back. | however, after a sleepless night the first night due to the noise of the ventilation system on the 8th floor, i moved to another room where the aircon was not working, numerous calls and face to face discussions took place and all assurances were given that it would be fixed. | 2 nights of very uncomfortable sleep followed as london was having an indian summer and i had not aircon! | finally at 1am on my final night a technician came to my room and ""fixed"" the problem but when i awoke this morning the aircon was not working again. | the staff said all the right things during my stay but the execution was poor and so very disappointing. | sad to say i doubt i will be coming back!'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''we stayed here after a gig at the o2... | i have stayed at many hotels throughout the sands of time. | this does not even class as a hotel. after signing in, we were led by the rude hotel receptionist to what seemed like a building full of bedsits next door! almost hostel styled corridors with paper thin walls that was not even part of the hotel. | when reaching the room we were shown the bathroom. i shower which we did not dare use. the ceiling was covered in black mould. the whole ceiling! | there were so many gaps in the skirting boards throughout the room/hotel. under the shower was covered some kind of plastic with a gaping gap... | the tea bags in the room were pg tips, that was the only good thing about this place. the cups were dirty. (we boiled water and washed them ourselves, burning my sisters hand in the process) the tv remote was not even for that tv brand, so that was not an option. | we missed breakfast, which to be honest is the only thing i was excited about. by the look of the facilities though i am glad i did not dice with death with their offerings of breakfast. you have mcdonalds across the road.. which i am sure offer a more viable source of breakfast. | the staff all in all are rude, poorly spoken and unhelpful. | the bar in there was unattended, we stood for 5 minutes. nobody came through, so we left disgruntled and bought beer from a shop. the balcony was terrible, the next door had there windows opening out on our balcony! we left the room to go to the o2, came back and the light was on!!!! they clearly snoop around your rooms when you are not there, luckily we hid our stuff...there are some good reviews of this place...do not trust them!'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''my husband and i stayed at rhodes hotel in may, 2005. we were given the triple room, because that is all that was left when we would booked. the bedroom/living area was rather dumpy, with what were once white -- but are now grey -- curtains hanging in the window. when i went to open the refrigerator, it was not plugged in and therefore had a stench. on a positive note, the sheets were clean and they had a coffee/tea set-up which was nice. | the bathroom made me want to cry. wooden floor. old, splitting-wood cabinetry. avocado green fixtures. i can live with the color, of course, but the toilet seat slipped. the big wooden door to the bathroom would automatically close behind us and there was no vent or window. as for toiletries, they give you one of those small ""cashmere bouquet"" soaps that were popular in the 60s. | we actually joked that, as a middle-aged couple, we were in our first youth hostel! however, when we went down to the breakfast room the first morning, there were families and couples our age who, from what we could gather, seemed content with their lodging. maybe we were in the worst room in the hotel? | we kept asking if there was not a better room for us to move to, but were told there was not. knowing we could not possibly stay there the entire three nights we would booked for, we spent over an hour the very next day looking for better lodging at the literally dozens of similar hotels in that vicinity. in all honestly, most were similar to rhodes hotel, but we found a few that were a step up. unfortunately, they were all booked up due to the flower show taking place at the time we were there. | we were supposed to spend our third, and last, day visiting an acquaintance who lived in the suburbs. once she heard how unhappy we were, she insisted we pack up and spend our last night with her. which we gladly did. | let me end by saying that we are pretty adaptable people when it comes to lodging. we have stayed at all kinds of accommodations in our 20 years together, and keep a running list of the top three and bottom three places we have ever stayed at. i am sorry to say that rhodes hotel is now on our ""bottom three"" list.'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''very disappointed with the hotel, we stayed one night, we had booked a double room and they put us two single beds together, then the breakfast was disgusting, in the room fridge was what they call continental breakfast, a sandwich of cheese with dry bread, two yogurts, and soluble coffee, that is not a continental breakfast'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''my fiance and i booked to stay for four nights at the rhodes in a superior room: i guess it is superior to their other rooms, but it was barely adequate.. breakfast was very poor, very limited choice, bread was straight out of the fridge and cold, and a piece of toast that we picked had mould on it. english breakfast was ok, but cost extra. on day two 750 gbp of electronics was stolen from our room. the hotel proprietors said ""this has never happened before"". however, i remembered that a reviewer had posted in december that some of their stuff was stolen and, when i mentioned this, the proprietress said ""there are doubts about that"" and told me they had told tripadvisor to remove the comment (and indeed i see that it has gone now). if they tell ta to remove my review, i will keep re-posting it. there is no security at all at the hotel: the front door is permanently unlocked; whoever sits at reception has a computer screen in front of them so that they cannot see people coming in and out (the proprietors denied this, but if i cannot see the receptionist how can he see me?); there are no cameras; there was no safe in the room; the proprietor said ""they recommend"" putting valuables in the safe at reception, and showed us a piece of paper saying guests ""can"" put stuff in this safe, but at no point did they advise us to do so. when we reported the theft the cleaning lady came upstairs and rifled through the drawers containing my fiance's clothes (in front of my fiance - incredible!) despite the lack of security, it seems inconceivable that someone came in from the street, climbed four flights of stairs, and happened to go into our room. throughout all of this the proprietors were incredibly rude, and their attitude was simply that the incident did not happen, on the basis that they have been in the business for many years and are good judges of character (their words) - so a member of staff could not be the cuplrit - and, as stated, it is incredibly unlikely that someone came in from the street: hence we must be lying. of course, the case will never be proven in court because (as the policeman who came to record the incident told us) the police do not have the resources to pursue petty crimes like this. we decided not to stay the last night, for which we had had to pay upon arrival (before seeing the room): the proprietress refused to refund us for the night we would not be staying because it was hotel policy; and, if they were to do so, it would be down to the ""goodwill of the hotel"", but that goodwill was not present ""because you said you would post a bad review on tripadvisor"" (her exact words). i would strongly advise people not to stay at the rhodes. the proprietors are the rudest i have ever encountered in any hotel in any country before (i am 50, i travel for work, and i have stayed in a lot of hotels!) i find all of the positive reviews about the place very suspicious, unless people have incredibly low standards. then again the hotel tell simply ta to remove reviews they do not like, so maybe that explains it. we moved down the road to the darlington, which was ultra-secure, had better rooms, had a great breakfast (all included in the price), and extremely polite and helpful staff - and was significantly cheaper!!'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''just spent bank holiday weekend at the mondrian. have stayed there a few times before, with no issues. i have organised this trip for my wife and i and 2 other couples. location is great &amp; the design of the hotel is great! on the saturday night went up to roof top bar. we were told that it was full &amp; no tables left! we explained that was one of the main reasons we had picked that hotel, and eventually we were allowed in! no problem getting a seats &amp; a table! it was not really that busy at all! the hassle getting in was really unnecessary &amp; spoilt that part of our evening! next morning at breakfast the waiter, first of all knocked water over my friends mobile phone &amp; wallet. did not seem at all bothered about this! then a few minutes later the same waiter while leaning over clearing the table from behind managed to drop a baked bean covered knife onto my wifes white trousers! again did not seem too bothered about this! next evening we dined at the oxo next door, before returning to the hotel just before midnight. we decided to have a night cap on the ground floor bar, but were told we could not go in as there were no tables available. we said we just wanted on drink &amp; were happy to stand. the bar was not at all full. we were told we could not go in &amp; the lady on the door suggested we could get room service in our room!! this was despite other people walking in off the street being allowed straight in! i have never experienced a hotel with such appalling lack of respect for its customers! | surely if the bars are not available to guests this should be made clear before taking bookings! this morning at breakfast one of my friends asked for another coffee. we had already had our bill but this was replaced with another bill for an extra 16. when queried we were informed that breakfast only included one cup of coffee. this was eventually cancelled from our bill as it was pointed out that we had not all had a coffee. i am not sure what has happened at this hotel, but a once good hotel has become a pretty awful one, and its all down to poor customer service and presumably poor staff training. my fourth visit will be most probably our last!'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''i booked on priceline and the pictures make it look like a nice budget hotel. boy was it not what it looked like. the rooms are much smaller than pictured. my room was crowded with only clean bed sheets i could feel the carpet had not been vacuumed and the wire hangers were all bent and out of shape. the room had two windows but only one could be opened the other was between the room and the bathroom with no way to open since the bathroom was made to cover the window. this meant the bathroom had not light or air and just smelled like mildew. no vents so the only way to air it out was to leave the door open. 3 rooms were booked the other two had bathroom lights that did not work because the wiring was just dangling and exposed instead of connected. one room had a window that opened to the laundry room and could not be locked. that room was switched to their ""suite"" which was a smaller room with two twin beds. the hotel is also located on a large boulevard with constant traffic. i live in los angeles and sleep with my windows open i was awoken multiple times to loud late night traffic. i do not typically mind staying at budget hotels or bare minimum hotels i am ok with that but this hotel seemed very dirty and felt like maybe people used it by the hour instead of over night. definitely did not feel the hotel was worth the price.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''this is no where near a 5 star or even 4 star hotel. the fridge on my mini bar was broken for three days and even though they checked to charge me if i had eaten anything, it did not occur to them to fix it. yes, i know i should have asked and it obviously did not bother me that badly because i kept forgetting to tell the desk, but a 5 star hotel would have fixed this without me complaining. then my toilet started leaking water all over my bare feet (needless to say i was not pleased). then i asked housekeeping for a lint brush and no one knew what that was (the fact that very few of the staff spoke sufficient english was likely the problem). the common areas seemed dingy as well. the concierge only gave recommendations from a well worn copy of zagat's and seemed to have no personal knowledge about what was going on in the city. | that said...the bed was really comfortable and the room was a good size. the american bar was fun. they fixed things when i remembered to ask. the doormen were quite pleasant. | but given my issues, i would not have paid the amount of money if i were not at a conference in the hotel. claridge's, the connaught, the mandarin oriental, to name a few....there are a lot of better choices.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''sad to be the only one to have received a poor standard of service at this beautiful and luxurious hotel. | my problems occurred before and after leaving the hotel - the service during my stay was wonderful. the staff are attentive, the rooms are luxurious, the atmosphere is stuffy but not stifling. | unfortunately, the online booking system encountered some errors when i booked my room. despite receiving confirmation for one price, i was told i would be charged another. this necessitated a phone call to the hotel, who advised they would honour their original confirmation. | had a great stay. met with some friends from the us and ireland. on check-out the bill was incorrect due to aforementioned 'problem with the computer system'. found it annoying to be stood at the cashiers desk whilst waiting for them to sort it out. they did, i left on my merry way. | that evening, on my return home, i realised that i had left two items in my room when hurriedly departing. jacket and ring. phoned immediately and reported it. retrieved jacket, no ring. called several times to check status of ring. was advised that it had not been found and was unlikely to be found. seemed a rather unsatisfactory response and wrote letter to the general manager. however, i do realise that this was partly an error on my part as i left it in the room. | meanwhile, before receiving a reply about my ring, i received an invoice for 340.00, which was taken off my credit card (three weeks after i checked out). this was all in error. i had paid my bill on departure. due to (once again) a system malfunction, they had taken another nights accommodation off my credit card. absolutely appalled that they had retained my credit card details and charged it without my knowledge. | since then there has been endless calls to the hotel and manager expressing dissatisfaction with their service, yet not one gesture of goodwill has been made except some rather lame apologies from about a million members of staff (not the manager). and still no ring. i know it is considered wonderful that the dorchester has 3 members of staff per guest, however it means that maintaining a complaint with them is next to impossible. | i am supposed to be visiting there later this year for another reunion, but i am loathe to do so, despite how wonderful a time i had there in may. considering the cost of staying at the dorchester compared with other 5* hotels in london, it is appalling how bad their service is.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''we booked a room here for 179 (room 666) and it smelled of stale smoke and looked out onto the air conditioning vents. the room was large with a good sized bed but had air conditioning humming all night. the bathroom was very large with a b-day and toiletries. breakfast was self-service, undercooked (sausages were pink and the fried eggs were runny) and bitter undrinkable coffee was served by half asleep waiters who kept trying to take your plates away when you were not finished. it was not up to the standard of a greasy spoon, never mind a london hotel. when checking out we had a slight problem with the bill but instead of being polite the manager used words to us such as ""anyone with half a brain"" and ""tough"" which made us leave the hotel feeling cheated by the whole experience. the location is great and if you do not have to interact with any of the staff and smoke like a chimney, you will be fine.'''",0

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''thank you - unfortunately the stay was not satisfactory and the apex london wall hotel service was not at a four star level - neither meeting your advertised, published and promised standards nor my expectations upon referral - accordingly the matters worrying me have been directed to your chairman and board directors for rectification and response. these were detailed in a letter plus attachments before i left and handed to the concierge for posting personally to the chairman. | until i am satisfied that more than passing reference by management has been made to my feedback relevant to the various matters raised - e.g. cleaning, privacy and the disturbing of guests, inability to meet simple photocopy requests, assuming a right to letters addressed to others, inability to understand your own telephone messaging/voicemail systems, safety and comfort of older persons using the bath and shower ... denial of access to a room 321 for a period - a room which had not been cleaned for nearly two days .... lack of initiative in resolving issues as they arose etc nb all issues submitted in writing over three days ... then i cannot reasonably encourage others to use the apex hotels limited services.'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the hotel has a fantastic location and the building and facilities are great. size is fantastic as is not a big hotel so you can feel a bit special. however, some rooms are unacceptable. they have great lookong rooms, but others where the bed merely fits and with small windows. if you go there, please make sure you know specifically what room they will assign to you. last time i was there they give me one that i am still trying to forget.'''",0
The Rembrandt,'''the hotel is in a perfect location and the quality of the rooms and communal areas is lovely and clean. | unfortunately we had money stolen from our room (a cleaner was seen entering our room on two occasions with no reason) but as she denied it no further action can be taken. ensure you lock all valuables away in the room safe as unfortunately you may leave with less than you arrived with. very disappointed and will not be returning.''',0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''with the exception of good service provided by the front desk staff and the hotel location, you can forget about the rest. room smells terribly, caught a bug crawling on our bed, breakfast served was horrible (sausage not fresh), service by the breakfast lady was rude when i made some request. what can i say? with that value that i paid, i indeed have a better experience from another hotel nearby just a week before we were at rhodes. i gave a poor rating if it is not because of its location and front desk staff service, it should be a terrible rating.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i wanted so much to leave a glowing review of our afternoon tea. which was a treat for my friend, first time in london and having recently lost her mum and husband. we had quite a wait for the cold sandwiches to arrive ( so clearly not freshly made as we were led to believe) and to top it all the fresh fruit tart had mould on the fruit, the pastry was very very soggy. clearly around 5- 7days old.. we had to leave them. i did email the hotel next day and have had no response at all. so unfortunately have to leave negative review. we are both from a food background so can spot defective food. we did not highlight the problem to the staff because she was clearly not english speaking (""the tea for you i will fetch"").. so thought it best to email. sadly no response. hence negative feedback on here.

Apex London Wall Hotel,'''the junior suite still remains claustrophobic for the bedroom and the view is just an ugly office building in a dead neighbourhood so too expensive for what it is worth. the room was cold and the shower door could not be closed and only one chair in the room we could not even eat properly our evening cesar salad at the table ( the worst cesarsalad ever)''',0
The Savoy,"'''it is such a shame to be writing this review, as the savoy could so easily have been a five star trip on this occasion, but we felt let down by the serving staff, who did not meet expectations. | we visited the savoy london recently for afternoon tea, and although the food was simply wonderful (divine even), it was very difficult to get any waiting staffs attention, we were left for a long time on our own between courses, we felt deserted even! this is not what is expected from a five star hotel. this is what makes it comparably poor in comparison to other five stars in london and i would not recommend unless staff pick up their game.'''",0
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''first let me agree with all the comments previously posted - the classic double rooms are very small. with a double bed in the middle and someone sitting on the one chair, you could not walk past to get to the window. with the wardrobe door and bathroom door you could not walk past to get to the room door! | having said that, the room was very clean and the bed comfortable so we had a good night's sleep. | on the downside: we had three unwanted knocks on our door from house-keeping (one just to say ""sorry, wrong room""; the ordered newspaper did not arrive until we rang reception; the tablet did not work when we wanted to look for some site-seeing ideas, though it had worked the night before. | finally, until the staff have been properly trained in the restaurant i would eat out. we ordered earl grey tea and had to explain to the girl what that was. it then took 15 minutes to arrive, only after we had to ask where it was. the cooked breakfast, when it arrived, looked very pretty, though as we had ordered toast, to find it under the poached eggs and bacon meant we could not have the marmalade that we had intended. in summary, unless you have plenty of time, go for continental breakfast. the girl was sweet, just had no idea of how to run a breakfast room. she will learn, but that should be done with staff training, not by guests having to explain and then ask ""where is my breakfast"". when it arrived, the breakfast tasted good, though very nouvelle cuisine, which is fine for dinner, but breakfast, speed is more important than looks. | would we stay there again? possibly, though not until the staff have got the hang of everything, (it is only been open a week) and we would definitely ask for a bigger room.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''booked 2 rooms for a family trip, so spent 210 here. they did not show us the rooms and the place is like a maze, we had to find them ourselves. one of the rooms was okay, although next to the kitchen so it smelled a bit bad. the other one was situated next to the big boiler and it was so loud all night, i could not get any sleep (and i was really tired...) first thing in the morning i spoke to a woman at the reception and she assured me she was going to speak to the maintanance guy and get it fixed. after spending a long day in london we got back around 7pm and it was not making the noise but it started up around 9 again. i went to speak to a guy at the reception and he basically laughed at me and refused to try and help or offer me a different room. main point of a hotel was for us was to get some sleep but that just was not possible. water pressure in the shower was very weak and there was no bath mat so i nearly slipped when getting out of the shower. light in bathroom was not working properly and lightbulbs were missing from the bedside lamps as well. breakfast was okay, parking and wifi was free and worked quite well but all in all we definitely will not be coming back here. poor costumer service.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i visited london for one day, and wanted to stay overnight and relax in the spa at corinthia hotel. as i live in another town, i did not have my passport with and offered the receptionist a scan. that was not sufficient, which was already strange as i had never had problems checking in using a scan in a passport scan in the past (including later that day at langham hotel). | based on my past experience i did not not need a passport to purchase a one day pass to the spa (i visited it quite frequently a few years ago). indeed, the spa receptionist did not ask for it, and i began to fill in my personal details in the questionnaire, when three (!) security guards appeared, literally grabbed me by the shoulders and threw me out through the back-door without offering any explanation! i advise everyone never to set foot in this horrible establishment (i cannot even bring myself to call that place a hotel after this encounter) and will never do that myself again.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''be aware you will pay a very high price. i was shocked when the hotel told me they control the rooms thermostat by setting a minimum of 19 degrees. it was too warm for us. they said they were going to fix it. i am still waiting. incredible how they want to control the temperature you sleep in. thank god in a few days we are staying at the waldorf. being a hilton, i am sure they understand the meaning of consistency!'''",0

The Savoy,'''first time there since its re-opening in 2010. other reviewers do not accord with our experience. the acid test of would we stay there again? no. only if we absolutely had to have valet parking (45) which was excellent. we experienced the worst nights sleep of any good hotel in london. | good points: valet parking (easiest place to park of any of the great london hotels) with its own private road and helpful staff. concierge and support staff excellent. shoes left out for a cleaning (free). good turndown bedroom service. reception staff attentive but lack of english can be telling. room service excellent. freshly squeezed orange juice divine. no tea making facilities in room and room service tea good but pricey. no water in room until night so you are forced to use room service or mini-bar. | bad points: our room (434). several items not working. fairly small but well laid out but colouring boring and no pictures and lacked any wow factor. . would not pass a four in the bed test as plenty of dust and dirt. flat screen tv not located on wall and took up valuable cramped bedroom space. bathroom adequate shower in bath but lacks safety rails. towels were good and plentiful. double glazing does not work well. savoy hill (road) was used for noisy loading of equipment from hotel from midnight until 2am. noisy wheelie bins and heavy boxes being repeatedly dropped etc. we complained twice but nothing was done. then from around 5:30 am onwards deliveries started and then the refuse trucks with engines on full revs parked outside for some time. peace returned after about 8:30 am. reception said they would offer us breakfast but in fact they did not. anyway lack of sleep (despite two sleeping tablets) meant that we were totally exhausted. | breakfast: one of us had breakfast in the more formal riverside restaurant. you go through the foyer restaurant (which is more like a passageway one reviewer was very impressed but less so us). food was mediocre (just one half of a tomatoe). service was chaotic. you had to repeatedly ask. babies crying and lots of children lessened the experience. pricey (basic price 31) for what it was.''',0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we had booked into a neighbouring hotel,but were transfered to this hotel due to overbooking.we were put into a large room in the cellar.there are no tea/cofee making facilities in the rooms,although this is provided free in the lounge.our room was directly below the reception.everytime somebody walked around upstairs,the floorboards creaked. the windows rattled all night,untill i wedged them with cardboard at 3 am.the dining room was next door to our bedroom,which meant you were woken by the staff chatting outside the bedroom very early.the staff where pleasant and the room was clean but very basic.the english cooked breakfast was poor.if you want a cheap hotel this will probably do for 1 night.i personaly would never go there again!'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''my ground floor room was one of the smallest i have ever seen and gave me a feeling of claustrophobia. the 'wardrobe' was literally the size of a broom cupboard, and the only place to keep my suitcase off the floor was beside the hand basin where it took up almost all the available shelf space. my double-glazed window was right on the street, and there was a lot of traffic noise all night. the weather was very cold and snowy, but the room became quite hot and stuffy from the central heating, so i had to keep the window partly open to get some (very cold) fresh air, and this also increased the noise level. | the free wifi worked very well in my room. the free breakfast is just adequate; i always have cereal with milk, yoghurt and fruit, but here there is no yoghurt or fruit. they have fruit juice, bacon, sausage and egg, toast with jam, and tea or coffee. | the location is very good ( apart from the traffic noise), being only a five minute walk from goodge street tube and the shops and restaurants on tottenham court road, and there are lots of buses passing right by the hotel (and causing much of the noise all night). there is a branch of waterstones bookshop on the next corner. | the manager and staff are very friendly and helpful, and there is a small garden at the rear, but it was too cold to enjoy it. | this hotel is good value for budget travellers at 50-52, but the single rooms are extremely small and the front rooms will not suit light sleepers.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''attended a function at the hotel last night, and was disappointed to see how the feeding was organized. waited for an hour and a half and then left as we could not get fed. | was so looking foward to seeing the hotel, it is a beautiful building, however cannot say the same for the hotel organization... cloak collection was also poorly done...'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''my comment at the reception was did i came in from a right door? because it was so untidy looked like a back door for an office. the room which is supposed to be a common room for customers (is on their web!) is covered with papers and hotel's private stuff nowhere to sit, let alone welcoming. booked a double room with a balcony which is on the web again, did not showed up. far from cleanliness for 97 pounds. english breakfast is extra 3 ponds otherwise nothing to eat for my standard of 97 pounds! location is good but this hotel is located full of b&amp;b area anyway. sleep quality is average except your neighbours do not slam the door in the mid night. i had to shout to make them be quiet... their web page says "", rhodes hotel is an elegant, georgian house much more than just a bed and breakfast london"" . elegant does not mean a whole of a wall, dust and dirty spots on the carpet, depressing lights. they should learn how to run a bed and breakfast is my over all comment.. if you want to sleep somewhere in london with internet connection, go for it. do not expect anything else.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we stayed at the hotel in december as i was hosting my compnay christams dinner in the savoy grill, which is another story and equally as dreadful. | having used the savoy on numerous occassions before its closure, we were both very keen and excited to experience the much hyped improvements. we had a 'king deluxe' room, so expected great things. | my wife had arrived earlier in the day and was greeted upon entrance and shown the room and was encouraged to 'enjoy her residence'. what the hell is that? 'enjoy your stay', is appropriate as we are in london in england in what is supposed to be an iconic hotel. 'enjoy your residence' simply does not fit the bill. | arrivng later in the day, i was not greeted by any of the four staff members standing idly in the foyer. i approached one in order to be directed to my room, only to be sent to the wrong part of the hotel. i stopped a staff member again, who also misdirected me. i therefore returned to ground floor and yet another staff memeber directed me to where i had already been. having explained this, a more senior peron finally took me to the room. one would expect that these people were given some amount of directional and navigational training of their workplace. | king deluxe, sounds good. having stayed in many 5 and 6 star hotels around the world, i was expecting a lot from the hotel that is strivinng to claim the title of number one hotel. they have a lot of work to do! the room, whilst clean was basic. good wardrobes but no drawers, unless you count the bedside cabinet drawers, where you could maybe store some underwear. nice bed and that was it, hardly 4 star. the bathroom was a major disappoinment. a single sink, the shower in the bath not separate, a nice big black chip in the bath, no tissues in the bathroom. very basic towels, hardly sumptious. | all very basic and at such a high cost and major hype one expected more, much more. | so after an absolutley horrendous experience at dinner, do not use the savoy grill, briefly, awful private room, very poor service, warm chablis and champagne and awful food, we thought that we would takle a drink in one of the bars. no chance. we were refused entry to either bar as they were full! this despite that fact that we were residents and had previously informed staff that we would require space at either of the bars, two people, not a big stress for them. | we were told, in a rather terse manner, that both bars were full and that maybe we could find a place nearby to the hotel. truly amazing treatment of your guests. | the upsdide, breakfats was good, although very expensive. after comlaining the hotel did refund the cost of our stay but we will not be back.'''",0
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,'''arriving in a car on a very 'wet' day with three children one would expect to be met by courteous welcoming door persons but not so here:- | we were totally ignored- had to double park and find our own umbrella to get the 6 of us in one at a time - while the staff just watched!! | nothing remotely like the reception we always experience at the dorchester (and most other hotels in london) just a few meters away -''',0
The Rembrandt,"'''well, great location does not mean excellent hotel, the hotel has bad services specially at night shift. they were requested the guests to to do the services their self which is not accepted at all. moreover, these bad service and negative experience repetitive with several guests. not recommended at all.'''",0
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''the wellesley hotel is a small boutique hotel catering to cigar smokers. the moment you approach the front doors of the hotel you are greeted by a massive cloud of cigar smoke from the cigar bars on both sides of the front doors. the smoke rises above the cigar bars to fill the air in all 30 plus rooms. the hotel is advertised as non smoking, which is just not the case. most of the people who fill the cigar bars are also guests in the hotel who do not stop smoking once they retire to their rooms. | on a positive, the location is excellent, the food is good and the staff is very nice. | do not stay here if you truly desire a non smoking room. | ````'''",0
The Savoy,"'''so this was another business visit to the savoy and i have to say over the past few years service has really taken a turn for the worst. visiting the savoy now feels more like a circus than a high class venue. on the positive side food in kaspars is still very good and i enjoyed oysters, steak, lobster and champagne but the rest was a joke. could not get a drink in either the american bar or the beaufort bar before dinner was told in both places there was an 1h waiting list for single persons. staff were confused, rude and not very helpful. if you are thinking about coming to the savoy just because of the name think again service is 2-3 star at the most, do not wast your time, just go the ritz, dorchester, madarin oriental or browns instead as they certainly still remember how to provide good service.'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''the best thing about the ridgemount hotel is that it motivated me to be anywhere but in it. i stayed here on the concluding leg of a longer journey (touring jordan, egypt, and italy), and it came as some surprise that this central-london hotel was the most disappointing of all my accommodation - not so much for its negative qualities, but for how thoroughly other hotels i would stayed at (including some in the middle of deserts) left it for dead. | this was the most expensive place i stayed at in six weeks (52 per night), which bought me a cupboard with a single bed, a sink, a chair, and a desk. the ""hotel"" is actually better described as an old-style boarding house, with few rooms having private facilities or room to swing more than two cats at once. i shared a toilet and shower with the floor above, which, while clean, took me back to the days of school camps and to the curious indignity of queuing in line for a second-hand shower. | the hotel was always busy with people coming and going, and the rooms are renovated to make use of every square inch of space. (other rooms on my floor, glimpsed through open doors, made my modest spread seem positively spacious, sleeping with three beds laid end-to-end.) doors and pipes were a frequent distraction, and when my tv set was unplugged to make use of the single power socket, the couple next door were good for a bout of energetic and entertaining sex. besides the free entertainment, there is wifi (ask for the password) and precious little else; the place is so gormless it encourages you to waste no unnecessary time there after your oddly invasive, portion-controlled breakfast. luckily, it is close to the underground and a modest walk to the soho theatres, regent street, oxford street, and other distractions. | recommended to me on good authority, i was a little shocked to find it so primate, especially for the cost. i would have been better severed staying at a backpackers, saving myself the money for the same exact facilities. thanks all the same, but i think i will try my luck elsewhere next time.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we stay at 5 star hotels around the world, 4 seasons, soneva fushi, gleneagles etc. | this is the first hotel we have ever stayed in where i felt we should not have our children. there is nowhere to enjoy pre-dinner drinks and it was made quite clear in our welcome tour that the children (12 and 11) had limited access within the hotel. apparently a law, however never experienced it in any other 5 star hotel in england e.g. limewood. we felt we had bought aliens with us not two well behaved and well travelled children. we were finally allowed a drink after arrival in the river restaurant surrounded by staff re setting tables for dinner, having been told trainers were not allowed (on a 12 year old!), but they would make an exception that day! | attention to detail, asked age of children, provided robes only a 5 year old could fit in. | room: our curtain was broken so we look at a lovely wooden batten and the sun shone in in the morning! | service: we had no turn down service, we returned to our room at 9.45 and no turn down service or fresh towels etc. when we first arrived the porters dumped our belongings in a heap on the bed. | management: we requested hot water bottles at 9.50, by 10.45 they called to say did not have them and would collect from another hotel we declined. next day 30 mins after check out we had a call accusing us of stealing the hot water bottles which we had never received (lovely way to celebrate my birthday lunch at heston's restaurant). | breakfast: we were told we would have to wait at least 15 mins for a table, we went to a restaurant in convent garden. | altogether the worst 5 star experience ever.'''",0

City View Hotel,"'''on arrival i was greeted by a lady that failed to move just said name, sign here that is 79 no please nothing then pointed to my room. i was also astonished by the overwhelming smell of onions. to my amazement there was three men on in the restaurant cutting onions up on the dining table. the room was basic, it had a bed i had to share a bathroom which was filthy. i called to make sure i could park my car and even though i was reassured there was only 30 minutes parking outside on the road. it is such a shame when some businesses are trying so hard to survive that you come across people who could not careless but manage to stay open.'''",0
Hartley Hotel,"'''i recently stayed here in a single room was expecting a typical b&amp;b room, what i got was a clean bed plenty of places for clothes, etc but no drinks making facilities not even a cup to use in the sink in the room. there was no full length mirror only a tiny one above the sink so no way to check yourself before heading out. also the room could need some serious updating the window did not shut (lucky there was warm weather) the sink smelled and the shower had mildew, but the bed looked clean eve though the mattress was a little lumpy. the walls are really thin so many pretty much woken up at 2, 3 or 4 in the morning from locals or tvs in the other rooms. the shared bathroom was ok till the last day and then pretty disgusting from the other residents. breakfast was great the first day then after appalling 1 piece of bacon to two pieces of toast come on if i had ordered full english i would have got more than that, no tea bags to make a brew only a pot already made up. with regards to the location great just what i wanted easy bus links and close to the police station so you feel pretty safe if a little noisy, and the staff were very friendly. all in all i would not stay here again.'''",0

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we stayed here in the run up to christmas on our way home to family for christmas day. we were here for a total of 5 nights, we were shown our room and were really disappointed at the size, way too much furniture in a really small area and there is very little room to lay your bags so we did not bother un packing - oddly the bathroom was a decent size in comparison. considering the amount of days we were staying in to hotel and flying internationally with a lot of baggage the room was not well chosen for us despite us mentioning where we had come from etc to the receptionist checking us in. | there is no doubt the hotel is exquisite, decor is stunning and the main reason why i chose the hotel. staff on the other hand left a lot to be desired, reception was underwhelming, we were rudely turned away from the bfast room one morning as we were 10 mins past the time - understand that we were late but staff should be able to explain in a courteous and friendly manner where we can get bfast (in the room next door it seems after we asked around) - it left a bitter taste and was to set the scene for the rest our time there. concierge was the same, pretty snobby and not inviting or friendly. the spa is beautiful and would recommend you take advantage of this. the location is ok - we usually stay in the mayfair area so for us we can spend the same money and get a better hotel in a better area (in our opinion). would we go back? no you can get much more for your money.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''to whom it may concern, | i am writing to you regarding my recent stay at the mondrian london , unfortunately it is to tell you that i am extremely disappointed with my experience which was my first stay at one of your hotels. i booked directly through your company and decided to call so i could get a better idea of what to expect and to enquire about your various facilities. i was transferred across to what i believe was a call centre based in the states and i spoke to a gentleman on the phone and requested a room with a river view as it was for a special occasion , my partners birthday. when we checked into your hotel the following week we were shown to our room and i questioned why we had a view of a building at the back of the hotel and not one of the river. we went back down to speak with someone at the concierge and they told us we seemed to have booked a standard room so there was nothing they could do , even though we were specifically told by a young american man on the phone that we would be able to see the river and he would also put in a request for us to stay on one of the higher floors as it was my partners birthday , so in reality we were completely miss-sold the hotel altogether , as there are plenty of hotels in london with views far more aesthetic than the back of a building , which was the site we had to endure , the only reason we booked with you in the first place was the thought of being able to enjoy watching the sun set over the beautiful city. we were told a riverside room was available but it would cost 100 for us to upgrade to one. as we were under the impression we had booked a riverside room and it was not made clear to us that we had to pay to upgrade , we decided not to but i found the handling of it rather unfair as we were falsely informed. later that day we decided to book a table for dinner at the sea containers restaurant a place recommended to us by a | dear friend , we got down there at around 21:15 and we were quite hungry so we ordered our food by 21.20 and an hour later we still had no food , we were told it was on it is way , the food finally arrived 1 hour and 25 minutes later and after me asking the waiters at least another 3 times. it was now 22:45 at night. we noticed that my order was wrong and my partners hamburger was smothered in mayonnaise after he had already requested for no mayonnaise , so i spoke to the manager and she sent the burger back but when it returned it was basically very rare again even though he had ordered medium to well done , but seeing as it was now already way too late my partner ate around the outside of the burger as by this point we were just hungry and fed up , when we requested the bill the manager asked if we had our complimentary drinks she told the waiters to give us, the answer was no as no one offered them to us. we ended up being told they would not charge us for our meal but we were not after a free meal we were out for a special occasion and we expected it to be memorable , unfortunately it was but for all he wrong reasons. overall it was a disastrous experience , we cancelled our plans to meet friends in the city and instead went up to the bar for one drink and decided to got to our room. what pains me is i was looking forward to my stay and i was excited and eager for it to be a special one for my partner on his birthday , instead i was left very upset and disappointed. i had also paid for the mini bar at check out in cash yet they still charged it to my card.i was left with no choice but to voice my concerns and i hope my criticisms of your establishment help you to make it a more pleasant experience for others in the future. | yours sincerely , | katie grant'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''unfortunately this is not a stay id want to repeat. yes its a relatively cheap hotel for london, so i did not have expectations, but you do expect certain basic things. however i was disappointed. | my train into london was delayed meaning i was late for a conference. i was intending on just leaving my bags at the hotel, and then heading straight to the conference. on arrival, someone let me in and said they would be with me in 2 minutes. it ended up being about 20 minutes. there was nothing i could do, i did not know where the reception person had disappeared to, and i could not just leave my bags there unattended, so i had no choice but to wait until they reappeared. not the best start. | on getting into the room it was small, but a pretty typical size for central london. first issue was i could not find a plug, i looked all around the room but no luck, so in the end i had to pull the tv out, and use the tv plug which was not ideal. the window was covered by scaffolding, the whole frontage of the hotel was undergoing some work, and there were workmen outside when i arrived, this made me nervous that someone could come clambering past my window so i had to keep the curtains closed whilst in the room. but i made sure the window was open as there was no air con and the room was rather stuffy. | the yale lock on my bedroom door had been tampered with, with the inner latch/lock having being removed (see photo). when in a hotel room i always activate the internal locking device whether its a bolt, a safety chain, or an extra turn of the lock. but with the inner lock/latch having being removed, it meant i had no assurance that nobody would enter my room whilst i was in there which was not great, especially as i was travelling alone. | the bed seemed very saggy and old. even just sitting on the edge of the bed, you tended to tip backwards into the middle of the bed as it was so worn. when getting in bed it was lumpy too, so i really did not have a great nights sleep. plus the fact that despite being an older building, the walls must have been very thin as i could hear everyone elses movements as they walked around, closed doors, etc. | the bathroom was ok, a shower cubicle, sink and toilet as you would expect. although there was no shower gel even in a travelodge or tiny b&amp;b, you get at least a small multipurpose shampoo/body wash container, but there was nothing provided here at all. | i cannot comment on the breakfast as i did not get the opportunity to try it. i went downstairs to be told there was no room, and that i would have to go back upstairs and wait! i explained that i had a train to catch and so could do with knowing how long the wait would be, the rather harried looking lady said that it was a very very long wait. i have had a good think and can honestly say, i have never stayed at a hotel that did not have enough room for everyone for breakfast before. out of curiosity i looked up how many rooms the hotel has 32 accordingly to their web site. there were not even half of this many tables in the breakfast area. as a result i had to abandon breakfast (even though i had paid for it within my rate) and then go and pay for breakfast at euston station. probably not such a bad thing, as i noticed that the thermostat in the breakfast area showed 25 degrees. | the only good thing about this hotel was the convenient location. it was less than 10 minutes walk from euston, is only 5 minutes walk from goodge street tube station, and a similar distance to some lovely bars and restaurants (i highly recommend the salt yard for unusual tapas!). | another point i noticed, was that every single fire door was propped open, despite them all having prominent stickers on the saying that they were fire doors and so must remain closed. did not give me the best impression of their view on health and safety practices. | on check out, the person simply took my key from me and said nothing. id expected to be asked how my stay was but no, no conversation was forthcoming. hence the only opportunity to provide feedback was to leave a review on tripadvisor.'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''id like to start this review by saying that i have backpacked a lot around the world so my standards are not too high. also i visit london for work quite a bit so i am aware of the poor value for money in london hotels compared to other cities. | however i was totally disappointed with this hotel and i have to say its the first time trip advisor reviews have let me down in many years of relying on them. | we stayed in the annex building in the top floor in a double room that was absolutely tiny and boiling hot. there is no air con but a fan which despite being left on all night and the window open failed to have any impact on the stifling heat in this attic room which was quite unbearable. the bathroom was also tiny although was obviously new compared to the rest of the room which was very grotty and not overly clean.being at the top of 4floor flights of stairs it was a steep climb up every day but i can live wih that.however the fire exit was a window at top of said 4flights across which you would have to totter precariously along a ledge to a neighbouring building. complete fire hazard. | the people staying in the room next to us thought it was so bad they checked out after 1night. | on the plus side the staff are very nice,breakfast was very good and the man serving breakfast is lovely.the location is very good -paddington is a very nice area and good access to most tube lines/heathrow etc. however i would definitely never stay in this hotel again although i would come back to the area. | reading back on the other reviews now i feel like i stayed in a different hotel and maybe that is the key as a lot of good reviews seem to be for the main house. | i regularly stay in budget hotels but this was a very unpleasant experience and not comparable.'''",0
Hartley Hotel,"'''we literally stayed there as it was relatively close to the olympic park to watch the foos. felt like being in a hostel. adequate i guess. shower rubbish, electricals tapped with tape tv did not work, cold water nope, wifi intermittent, grimy round the shower base. breakfast ok but sausages dreadful. could not be bothered to complain cos what is the point ?? we needed somewhere to sleep. also i booked a twin room and got a double. great sleeping with my daughter'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''my family of 4 stayed here for 2 nights. originally we booked 5 nights but decided to reduce it to 2 nights after staying the 1st night. | this hotel is ideally located in the heart of london city. great for shopping, beautiful hyde park is just behind and concert halls , museums, iconic buildings are all nearby. staff are courteous and helpful. the restaurant serves delicious food. i love the chinese breakfast set. however the two rooms, both junior suites, are very old and run down. my biggest grumble is the toilet. there is no separate shower so we have to shower in the bath tub. the little shower screen moves, kind of dangerous if you lean against it and it does not serve much purpose. the whole toilet floor is wet after that. it is very messy! the water level comes up to our ankles during shower because the water does not drain fast enough. | most hotel rooms have coffee maker or tea pots for making a hot drink, our rooms do not have this basic facility which really is a let down. for the price i paid and the room standard i get i feel this hotel is very expensive.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''we stayed here for.the baftas. well as expected it was busy but i expected this so should of the hotel to.... we turned up about 2:30 so early i know. but was told room was not ready yet. 15-20 mins was told. so 20 mins later room was not rdy another 5 mins i was told as i said my wife is disabled. 30 mins later we got our key. the front desk staff seemed ok. not the most helpful | but was two people in charge. invading my was was told to que in line where check in was to see if room.was rdy..... which was a long line. so.finally get key and rushed to get rdy as needed to be rdy by 4. was so angry and getting lied to and rude staff. only staff that seemed friendly was bar staff. every one else was stuck up like they are above everybody. you get better and more help from a hotel like premier in. rooms are not 5 star. basic notting special at tall.''',0
Newham Hotel,"'''do not bother stopping at this ""hotel"". did not seem like we stopped in a hotel, our room was next door to the main hotel that seemed to be converted flats or offices. shower was dirty with no toiletries, door to the room would not lock properly. minimal toilet paper. beds? sort of i suppose if that is what you would call them. did not even bother stopping for breakfast, could not wait to get out.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''good - location of hotel is brilliant, close to south kensington station and harrods. bad - rooms are old and in need of refurbishment but then again we got what we paid for, prices are cheap for london and we were out all day sightseeing so it suited us. breakfast is nice. overall, do not expect much from the hotel but then again locaton makes up for it'''",0
The Savoy,'''we were in london for a few days and called into the hotel for a cocktail before heading to see the bodyguard was musical. the bar we went into was actually quite dirty. the table next to us had not been cleaned after the last customers left and to my shock the beautiful mirror above our table was so dirty and full of streak marks that you could not see your reflection. not what i expect from such a top notch place!!''',0
Ridgemount Hotel,'''i stayed at the ridgemount hotel in january with my family and found it to be ok if you are on a very tight budget. i found the hotel to be very old with very few facilities. we were situated in the room directly next to the breakfast room and the kitchen which provides. because of this we found that in the mornings the room became very noisy (starts aroung 6.15 am!) due to the thin walls and door. this was not really suitable for a family with two small children. the breakfast was ok. | even with the price in mind i was looking for that little bit extra. with the benefit of hindsight i think it might have been better to pay a little bit extra for a more quality hotel.''',0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''my wife and i received a gift card from friends for the mandarin oriental. it was denominated in us$ but, as the voucher was purchased in sterling in the uk, we assumed it would reflect the sterling amount. it was for $300. i checked the fx rate 30 minutes before arriving and saw that it would be about 147-150. it transpires my friends had chipped in a ver generous 150. | however, we were informed that it was worth only about 130 when we arrived. i checked with the hotel's internal bureau de change desk and found that, not only did they apply their own harsh exchange rate completely unreflective of the market rate, but they also took commission on the exchange. i complained and got nowhere- i did not want to ruin the evening so did not go as far as i would have liked. the man behind the desk smugly said we could use the voucher in the mandarin oriental in boston usa without incurring the commision/fx rate. obviously, this was extremely unhelpful as we imagine few london cabbies would accept that fare. this left a very nasty taste in our mouths. we checked with our friends to see if they were told of this. they were not and were appalled. they said they would not have bought the voucher had they known. there are countless hotels/restaurants offering vouchers w/out the skim off the top. | long story short: if buying a voucher for for the madarin oriental, be sure to factor in that they will take 20% before you have even walked through the door. | we used the voucher for a meal at dinner. i do not know whether mr. blumenthal is aware of the situation but, as it overshadowed the evening, i will not comment further other than to give this warning to others and 1 star.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''i booked this hotel for a one night stay prior to a course in london. i was drawn by the pool facility and the area. it was an ok enough stay but, like so many uk hotels, i thought it was little more than average and i was dissappointed that one had to pay extra to use the spa and pool as well as the internet. | the reader may wish to take note that i do not generally like hotels in the uk anyway, especially london hotels, but why should one not expect that bit more for the price you pay? | i booked over the internet, by the hotel website, the day before but got to the hotel to find there was no record of my booking. the reception staff were efficient enough to find me a room anyway but i could not help think that this could have been disasterous at a very busy time of year. i did have my laptop with me with the relavent email proving my booking. | the first room i was shown was quite spacious and very clean but it had a lovely view into the centre of the hotel and the workings of the hotel heating system (why do hotels do this or why do they charge the same for rooms with a poor view?). it was a bit dark but would have stood for one night. however, i could not find the socket to attach the cable for internet connection (no wireless internet connection here) and so i asked for a change of room. the second room, the one i settled on, had a lovely westerly view over the v and a and across the rooftops of kensington. it was smaller but better appointed. it was also very clean. there was an impressive size safe big enough to take a laptop. | i used room service to order a salad with tuna mayonaise. the sald was very freshly cut although did arrive without the dressing that was stated on the menu; i was a bit pushed for time so i did not pursue this. the person whom i ordered from did not understand what a bitter beer was; he only thought that the hotel had lager and guiness. he did phone me back though to say they had tetleys and was that ok! | i though i would have more time than i did and so i would have used the pool. i was put off, however, at having to pay 7-50 (""reduced rate for hotel guests for 24 hour access"") for what would have been less than an hour's use. why on earth should hotel customers have to pay extra for the pool? i was dissappointed not to be able to book a massage as the bookings were full; this is an experience that i have had elsewhere. hotels advertise such facilities but pitch up and the bookings are full; what is the point? | internet access was by mycloud and so i had to pay, again, for that. i think that the rembrandt hotel should catch up with other simular hotels in london and uk and offer complimentary wireless internet access in all rooms. | staff were friendly and helpful. | the aircon was very noisy but i was very tired and so slept well (i should have taken notice of this from another review. it would have been very tryng for more than one or two nights. | in summary, if the rembrandt hotel | 1. had complimentary wireless internet access | 2. did not charge extra for the pool or spa. | 3. sorted out the noisy heating, | it would be great, otherwise i doubt that i would stay there again. | the area is lovely and better than the very centre of london. | i was amused to see the kazakhstan embassy next door but i did not see borat hanging around!'''",0
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''i have had two negative experiences at this spa, the spa its self is beautiful, the service on the other hand is poor. | first time (sept 2013) my experience was not good, when i arrived at the spa they told me that my therapist had gone home unwell and that they could not provide either of my pre booked appointments for the day (massage and facial). they were not very apologetic about not notifying me in advance and with no ""you can have the next one on us as a gesture of good will!"" i was just about to walk out the door when they shouted to inform me they had now found someone to undertake my treatments. | the treatments themselves were good, however the staff member who provided them had clearly been called off her break or something. she did not introduce herself, she called me and i followed her upstairs like a naughty school pupil being summoned by the headmaster. overall it was hard to relax after spending 30 mins waiting in reception waiting to see if they could find someone with not even the offer of a free drink for my trouble. | i decided to give the spa another try (jan 2014), as after all the spa its self is quite lovely. sadly this time was worse that my first visit. the service was lazy and downright rude from start to finish. i arrived at the spa 20 mins early for my facial, i walked up to the reception desk, the desk had two staff and no other customers, however i waited to be greeted and in the end i gave up and said hi, i am here for my appointment. the receptionist who booked me in sniffed ""you are early"", i could see this had annoyed her and so i suggested that i sit in reception and order a drink. so i sat down with the drinks menu 2ft from the reception desk, and waited and waited for one of them to take my order, however the receptioest who booked me in was too busy chatting on the phone to a friend. 20mins later one of the reception staff finally asked if i wanted a drink, i ordered and by the time the drink came i had to down it in 2 mins flat as my therapist was waiting. | again the treatment its self was good and my therapist was very nice. when i came to checkout and paying , the same lady who made me wait 20 mins to order while she ignored me, said to me in a tone ""you know you have to spend over 300 to use the spa facilities!"" to which i informed her that i did not use any spa facility (assuming she meant the pool, steam etc), she corrected me ""that includes the changing room and shower"". firstly her tone was rude and secondly, what! my treatment involved removing all my make-up and putting a hair treatment on my hair and scalp! but i am not allowed to use the showers to wash off what they put in or to reapply my make up which they removed!?? this is insane! | overall, rude and poor quality service from a spa that will not even let you wash your hair after they have applied a load of gunk to it! and will give you attitude if you challenge this crazy policy. | you have been warned!'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''what a dump! the staff were pleasant but sad to say that is the only good thing. when i arrived i was handed the remote control for the tv with the room key....that did not bode well! there was one double plug the room was shabby the furniture cheap and nasty. however. the room stank of mould! it was rank! the shower was so bad i refused to shower in it. the sink smelt of sewage and the toilet did not flush properly. needless to say i did not sleep well!!! i was in room 5. when i complained the lady on reception was not going to accept that there was a problem until i showed her a picture of the shower i had taken on my phone. | breakfast i did not try. overall yeuch yeuch and double yeuch!!!!! avoid!, i put in a formal complaint to my place of work. never again....'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''the location of the hotel is perfect. it is close by the british museum and other must see highlights in london. the staff was very friendly and breakfast was nice. the room nevertheless was terrible. to start with the looks of it. it was so tiny that we could not even open our luggage properly. the bed was also very tiny for two persons, and also the mantras was very hard. in the shower there was no shampoo or body wash available. on top of that, the room was so hot when we arrived that even though we turned of the heat completely, it was still very warm the whole night. we slept terribly and it has wasted our entire next day.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the mandarin chain acquired this property from trust house forte around five years ago. they made some super improvements, including carving up the old ballroom-style restaurant into two high quality eating places plus a very hip and active bar. all the bedrooms were also refreshed. | the standard bedrooms here are good value by london five star hotel standards. the rooms are spacious and very well soundproofed. i especially like the fact that each room has a small hallway from which separate doors lead to the bedroom and the bathroom. | a new general manager arrived a year or so ago and there is evidence that a few problems are now emerging, mainly in relation to personnel. | two examples from a recent trip. flying transatlantic overnight, i booked a two night stay so that i could guarantee access to my room around 7:45am, shower and meet a colleague for an 8:15 breakfast in the restaurant. when i arrived, i discovered that my room was not available ie it had been sold twice, once to me, once to a second person who had presumably promised to check out early but had not checked out early enough. since the hotel was full, i was invited to use the shower in the basement spa to get ready for my meeting. | arriving in the breakfast room, supposedly one of the prominent power breakfast venues in london, i found my colleague comfortably seated. all seemed well until two chinese children totally lacking in discipline showed up with a useless english nanny at an adjacent table. who was the clever maitre d' who planned that seating arrangement? | i have had good luck at this hotel over the years but i am now thinking i will switch to claridges.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''stayed at the corinthia for a 3 night break in london over the childrens summer holidays | firstly let me say the accommodation, spa facilities and location of the hotel are second to none in london, where we have stayed as a family of 4 many times. the room presentation (fresh flowers/fruit and the gifts/toiletries specifically for the age of each child were a really nice touch. | staff service worthy of note was the housekeeping service three times per day including an excellent turndown service, the leisure club staff pleasant and very knowledgeable and the waiting staff efficient and very accommodating. not so good service from the sommelier, replacing bottles of water when empty without being requested and forgetting to serve soft drinks which were ordered until prompted then plonking them down without a word (seemed to be too much trouble in a fairly quiet restaurant). | now to the main point of this review. i am very much a believer in the principal that you get what you pay for but also you should only pay for what you get unfortunately at nearly every opportunity during our stay the corinthias charging policy seemed to disagree with this. | firstly we stayed 3 nights for the price of 2, however when i checked the website pricing the proposed 3 for 2 offer worked out more expensive than booking the 3 nights individually. after some negotiation with the bookings department they did agree to charge at the true rate for a 2 night stay. maybe just an unfortunate mistake until we dined in the northall restaurant on the wednesday evening. the website offered kids eat free but yet once again we had to point out their own offer to get the childrens meals removed from the bill. | finally on check out from what was an excellent break there was an item included on the bill which we had not consumed from the mini bar. another negotiation ensued with the receptionist resulting in her agreeing to remove the item from the bill. once back home in cheshire a quick check of my credit card bill revealed that the item had been charged. on the first phone call to the corinthia i was assured the charge would be credited immediately, however no action was taken as a week later i had to phone again to insist the refund was processed. | in summary this is a sumptuous hotel in a great location with the potential to leave its guests feeling relaxed and delighted with their luxury experience but the corinthias sharp practice in its charging policy left us feeling ultimately drained.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel is beautifully decorated, in a great location, and some rooms come with an amazing view-- i expected the rest of my experience to measure up. firstly, my entire family was shocked at the completely bland and distasteful quality of the food. simple things like a muffin or pizza was totally flavorless and dare i say pretty disgusting. it was disappointing to have to pay so much for such tasteless food. spending six days there i found it rather annoying to have to constantly leave the hotel get a good meal. the staff overall was friendly at least, but seemed to have no clue what was going on with anything. the first two days we spent there we had to renew our room key six times because it would randomly stop working. they kept sending us to our room with different keys that kept not working rather than taking the time to actually check it out themselves. we literally had to ask them to, and then the key worked. that said, almost every staff member we encountered was completely and utterly unhelpful. they also made countless mistakes that they would constantly make excuses for or some instances we would have to ask them for service that they should have provided (like in any other hotel i have ever stayed in). i think i would rather come across outright rude staff members than completely useless ones. example: i spent the entire day at the spa with my family only be told 5 minutes before my massage that their ""system"" had booked me with a therapist that was not even working that day. i asked why they would not have told us when we checked in at 10 am (by this time it was 3pm) and again she said, it is the ""system"" and that she has no idea what could have happened. personally the beauty of this hotel does not outweigh the all the disasters within.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this hotel is a conundrum, and by that i mean it is just a mess for the sake of design in many ways. i think most people who travel (especially long distances) want comfort and service to be among the things that are high priority. the london mondrian misses on both of these elements. the room (river view balcony suite - one of the top categories) was cold and stark. i could not get the room warm and despite attempts to call this to the hotel's attention, the heat simply does not work well. housekeeping told me this is a major complaint among guests. to make this worse, to get any level of heat one has to keep the fan on high at all time - so it is like being on an airplane (not something someone wants to experience after getting off an 8 hour flight to london). many of the other negative comments/reviews i have read about the mondrian are unfortunately all too accurate and true. the bath/shower (including marble floor) is also extremely cold. the hardwood floors and stark design of the room (cheap in appearance) make the room even less relaxing and warm. i had to stand under the shower to stay warm when showering (eventually the water got hot - but this too was an effort). | one of the most annoying things on arrival was the inability to actually locate the entrance (no sign - nothing). there is construction around the hotel and the taxi driver got me as close as possible, pointed me in the direction of the entrance, and off i went on a long walk with heavy luggage. when i reached the front entrance no one was there to assist. i had to pull my luggage up a ramp maze and at the top was greeted by someone asking my name and what city i was traveling from (without bothering to ask me if i needed help with my luggage). the front desk initially saw in my reservation i had requested a higher floor (because i had read on tripadvisor these are some of the best view rooms), and she initially confirmed i was on a high floor, then proceeded to say ""i am sorry the room type you have booked is only available on floor 3 - 5, and we have you on floor 3, but the room will be fine."" what kind of explanation is that? what is even more annoying is that after i had explained i was exhausted after a long journey and just wanted to get to the room, the pest of a greeter insisted on showing me around the hotel while holding me captive by not giving me my room key until finally i said, i am perfectly capable of getting to the room on my own. i was annoyed because at no point when i had arrived was there anyone to offer any assistance, then someone is expecting me to listen to an explanation of the hotel and to walk me to my room after i check-in. | when i arrived, the media/tv was not working and stayed off the entire day. i was playing around with the controls thinking i needed to learn how to work the system, eventually called down to the front desk and they told me the tv system was not working. | like many other reviews, i too was startled out of my skin when the fire alarm went off. why cannot the hotel get this right? it is obviously a problem given how much it is mentioned here. | finally, the service is inept - a supposed 4 - 5 star hotel run by a bunch of ill-trained trying to be hip youngsters does not cut it in this price range. | beware of your room assignment too. the hotel put me in a room that was not like the description on the website. the river view balcony room was supposed to have an open floor plan (according to the website description and floor plan). however the room was not open, had a wall, and the bathroom was laid out nothing like the website described. i called to complain about this, and the manager told me that many room layouts vary and insulted me by saying that i should see this on the website. however, there is nothing on the website that mentions this on the pages that show the room layouts. what i got was the room in the category below what i had reserved although with a balcony, so the hotel is calling it something else because it has a balcony - the layout of the room (broken up with a tub stuck in front of the shower door that is a nuisance basically) is not what appears on the website for a river view balcony suite. | view? what view? there is none from the 3rd floor suite i was assigned - just an ugly barge and some buildings across the river. | this hotel is highly over rated. the service and accommodations make it undesirable. i have stayed in the mondrians in both south beach and los angeles. these properties are in a more eclectic area and ""fit in"" - however, the london mondrian is not at all appealing. sacrifice of comfort for the sake of design runs rampant in this place. if i had not prepaid for the room, i would have left after the first night. just not worth the hassle. there are too many fine hotels in london to have to tolerate some of the problems going on at this new hotel. i travel to london frequently, but will not be back to the mondrian. what is even more annoying is to read management responses to the reviews that are legitimate complaints - pointing out the positives and mentioning again the design elements of the hotel. i have intentionally not pointed out any positives (there were really none) in my review so that management cannot pretend to latch upon this to twist their response to a negative review into a positive guest experience.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''having stayed at other dorchester collection hotels in the past (such as the beverly hills hotel), we were very excited about staying at the dorchester in london as this was our first trip to the uk and this hotel boasts on it is web site that it ""embodies the highest service values"". i beg to differ! upon arriving after 20 plus hours of traveling from hawaii, we were told by a very young looking eric (at reception) that our room was not ready. this surprised us, as we were not asking to check-in early (it was already about 3pm in the afternoon london time) and we saw other vip travelers being checked-in (i will drop a name here...jane seymour the actress). we were not even offered a complimentary drink at the bar or a room to freshen up in, as other hotels of this 5 star standard usually do when your room is not ready. so trying not to be ""ugly americans"" (even though we felt the need to shower and very jet lagged) we said nothing and took about a 1 hour walk in nearby hyde park. when we returned, fully expecting to be checked-in, we were again told that our room was not ready. being totally exhausted at this point, we sat in the beautiful lobby and promptly fell asleep. sometime later, we were woken up, escorted up to our room and dumped. the room was nice (not great) and the bathroom exquisite but the damage was already done, being that first impressions are everything. we were not even offered an apology of any type for any of our inconvenience. i think if the management of the dorchester is going to let teenagers drive the rolls- royce of hotels, so to speak, they should at least give them a few driving lessons first. we found london to be a one of the most wonderful cities that we have ever visited....so do not stay here if you truly want to experience the true warmth and hospitality of this great city and her people.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''visited the savoy grill for pre-theatre supper before performance of gypsy. on the website it looked great value for money with 3 courses for less than 30 hence the reason for booking. on arrival the restaurant was not open and were greeted with a lady who said we are in the middle of a staff meeting wait outside, then were told by a man in the foyer not to queue!! this then followed by being shown to our table then given the menu, we ordered and was not long before the food arrived, however as i had gone to the ladies when the food was served they had left a cloche over my plate to keep the food warm, good idea, however i was not prepared for what greeted me when the cloche was lifted...... beef ragout with bone marrow with an accompaniment of insect!!! the little black insect scuttled across the plate and ran underneath the rim of the plate much to my horror and the shock of the waiter who had lifted said cloche. he then proceeded to look for the insect and said i do not know where that came from but we will not charge ha ha!!! then left me to eat my starter without an apology or even offered to take away the plate and change it for another. i think i was so shocked to see this that i did not know what to say at this moment. to be perfectly honest i was completely flabbergasted at not even being apologised to or the offer of another starter, definitely not something you would expect from the savoy!!! what was supposed to be a good value meal also turned out to be 116!! anyway needless to say that we will not be back but good point, gypsy was fantastic!!'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''firstly i have to say i work in fire safety. | the hotel is in a great location, close to the tube and paddington. the staff are friendly and welcoming and very kindly carried the luggage to the room. unfortunately we were on the top floor so lots of steps. the room itself is very basic in decor and contents but then for a room you sleep in it was adequate. the bathroom was a pleasant surprise with a jacuzzi bath and lovely mood lights. | the general maintenance of the place was sum what lacking and if the bedroom had been to the same standard as the bathroom it would have been ideal. | we made a cup of tea and found the milk was off. good idea having the fridge in the room though and loved the free wi fi. | breakfast in the morning was awful. cheap processed ham, cheese and toast. not very nice at all. | not worth 80 a night, even if it has a good location. | now the reason i mentioned my work was that this place scared me. not many fire doors, fire extinguishers and general thinking of the guests safety. death trap waiting to happen especially the rooms next to kitchen in the basement. | i definitely will not be returning.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''as a frequent diner in london's top-end establishments, i have dined at the savoy at least 10 times before the refurbishment, each time enjoying it more and more. my very recent visit to the thames foyer made me confused and angry. the staff have ruined this beautiful legend of a hotel. | my friend and i arrived at around 7pm, expecting to have drinks in one of the bars. the beaufort was full and there was a waiting list at the american bar. fair enough, we sat in the thames foyer instead. | we were given the beaufort bar menu, and treated with complete indignation when we asked to see the thames foyer's food menu as well. apparently this is too much trouble. | our drinks arrived, these were ok but absolutely nothing special for the price they cost. the crude garnish was just a huge chunk of grapefruit/lemon with pips still intact and a sprig of mint. very amateur-looking. a minuscule bowl of nuts also arrived. | we then had to wait about 20 minutes for someone to take out food order: 2 caesar salads. these were once again ok but not great. the croutons were burnt and stale, nothing remotely crunchy or fresh about them. | our empty plates were taken away promptly, along with the nuts we barely had a chance to touch and that was it. for the next 35 minutes we sat with empty glasses, trying to catch the attention of our waiter who was busy mincing around and plumping cushions, trying his hardest to avoid eye contact with us. | we finally managed to get the attention of another waiter and ordered 2 desserts. i enquired about the flavours of their ""famous ice teas"" mentioned in the menu as having lots of different flavoured syrups available. in a hugely condescending tone, i was informed that they would make ice tea from any of the teas on the menu. ok then, not quite what i was asking, but i suppose an earl gray will do. | the desserts arrived. by this point i was so thirsty that i asked where my ice tea was. the waiter apologised and said they were still cooling it down. this gave us the chance to try our valrhona chocolate praline tranche, which for some reason had a chocolate sauce around it that tasted like roast beef. perhaps the chefs use the same pans for everything?? the dessert was quite good, but incredibly rich and unbalanced. i could not finish it for feeling sick. | when my ice tea finally arrived, i was a little bemused to find out that it was literally just cold earl gray tea. no decoration on the glass, no infused fruit, just a little jug of sugar syrup, which i had to find out for myself since nobody said anything. | all this ""luxury"" came to just over 100. i do not mind paying lots of money for excellent food and service, but this was just a joke. nobody even said goodbye to us on the way out. the staff were literally going out of their way not to talk to us, and when they did it was patronising and unbelievably unfriendly. | a great big shame. so much money invested in a hotel to make it look stunning, but they could not invest in the right people. disappointing beyond belief.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i was so disappointed with the rembrandt - having made a booking over the phone for 7 people to celebrate my fathers 90th birthday with afternoon tea - at the receptionists suggestion we decided to use the restaurant rather than the lounge. there was no knowledge of the booking when we arrived and initially we were told we could not use the restaurant. that was eventually rectified and the staff were attentive but we waited nearly an hour for tea. the scones were delicious, but the sandwiches were bad - big and floppy with crusts left on and the fillings incredibly bland - not the best quality at all. the tea was weak - one tea bag to a large pot! | we booked it because it had been a favourite place of my fathers in past years. | afternoon tea is not what the rembrandt does well.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''booked &amp; paid for the savoy yesterday over bookingcom only to arrive at the hotel to be told there were no rooms in the entire hotel left for us to stay in! | we were also told that no payment was taken because it is the hotel that takes it after our stay but the payment was taken by the booking agency! | there are really no words to describe a letdown of this kind from a hotel like this one... it is certainly not what you would expect on arrival with the intention of staying there! | i would avoid this hotel at all costs as you can book it online, there are actually rooms available online to book, but on arrival you may very well be turned away and left stranded as we were! | shocking to say the least!'''",0

The Savoy,"'''a man's best friend is allowed in the hotel on the basis: | (i) i am blind | (ii) dog is under 20 lbs - basically a poodle or shitzsu size! | when i said my black labrador is 9 yrs old - the response was if it was puppy it would be fine. | just a note to the policy maker: | a puppy dog would be a nightmare to manage, clean and control. a seasoned dog is fully trained and cleaner than most guests. | stick with the red carnation hotels who all love dogs of any size! | cannot provide any further information on this hotel at this point on the basis that i could not get my foot in the door. but a top quality hotel always puts the customers needs first. a yes of course policy is what you expect from a top class line hotel. | consider a policy change or at least a refuse entry on inspection of the dog behaviour at entry point for a full refund. that way a customer who brings his pet does so at his own risk assessment and if he is lying you refuse entry and lose nothing. | most people who can afford 5 star hotels are disciplined high acheivers who have probably trained their dogs to a high standard. | give us the benefit of the doubt rather than ... i am sorry we cannot help you... thank you for calling us.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''disappointing. we wanted to have breakfast as a special birthday treat, but no. only those staying could have breakfast. fine, understandable.they seemed to think , when we called ahead,that it was a good idea to come in for cocktails overlooking the river and we were told how wonderful the restoration has been. again, no. at the entrance to the bar a youngish woman woman approached us, we thought she was welcoming us, how lovely, but no. she had come to us at the entrance to tell us we would not be served as children were not allowed in the bar. she had come to stop us going in.we asked if our child could sit with us and have a non-alcoholic drink , she is fourteen. no. we could go to the area where afternoon tea was still being served. off we trekked, no again, they were fully booked. we left and will have to find somewhere a little more accommodating in london to celebrate special occasions. style and excellence in a hotel is as much about the way they treat those who will foot the bill as it is about new paint on the walls and new uniforms. no ?'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we stayed at this hotel from 19 to 21 sept (3 nights). i have to admit that i was a bit wary of staying in this hotel as i knew that it was rather old. having stayed there, the hotel was old but had a charm to it. the room which we stayed in was freshly painted and clean. mrs rees (one of the owners) had generously given us a triple room for the price of a double room as we had requested a room on the ground/first floor. the room faced gower street, a busy street, and was quite noisy at night with the traffic wheezing by. so please request for a room facing the back if you are a light sleeper. | however, the busy street made us feel safe walking back to the hotel at night. only guests were given a key to the main door and there was a cctv focussed on the main door with someone monitoring from the office at almost all times. moreover, the people staying at the hotel were mainly couples, students and families and this hotel was located amidst a row of hotels. so we (2 female travellers) felt quite safe staying there. | the hotel was centrally located - goodge street tube station is a few minutes' walk away and leicester square a few more minutes' walk. the shower took some getting used to as we were used to a detachable showerhead rather than one fixed to the wall. breakfast was included in the room rate - it was english breakfast - simple but filling and the staff serving at the dining area were efficient and pleasant. mr and mrs rees and their son as well as another staff manning the office were friendly and helpful. there were free tea/coffee making facilities and internet access in the lounge area. | all in all, we would consider staying at this place again if we ever do come back to london.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''stayed here a couple of years ago and it was amazing, we were attending a business meeting at the savoy so i took the opportunity to stay here for the weekend. bigmistake. | firstly we were put in a disabled room , the room itself was ok, the bathroom was a fully functional disabled bathroom not the luxurious one we had on our last visit, second problem was we were overlooking a side street which also led to the service area for the hotel, staff were moving trolleys around all night on both nights so we did not get much sleep.we went to the american bar and beaufort bar each night, on both occasions we were told there was no space, a lot of the bar was taken up by tourists just popping in for a drink, nothing wrong with that but there should be some sort of system for residents, we did get in after a 30 minute wait and the staff were very good. on the saturday we had a meal in the ballroom, my wife was very ill within a couple of hours and was being sick all night, we missed the breakfast on sunday as i had to look after my wife who did not want to leave the room. the weekend was a bit of a disaster and for the amount of money it cost to stay here i feel this is not acceptable. | i am still waiting for a response from my verbal complaint when i checked out. | it really is a beautiful hotel but we were let down badly on this occasion.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we stayed at the savoy last year, a surprise birthday gift from my husband and even more of a celbration as i just discovered i was pregnant. the stay was superb, despite the first room being tatty...the helpful staff quickly changed rooms and provided a bottle of lauren-perrier. | this year we returned with our four month old son, booked directly with the hotel this time and upgraded the room. | how disappointed. we checked in 10 mins before 2pm, but still our room was not ready ""a problem with the room"" we were told. i had booked an early check-in. i explained that we had a 4 month old and that we had been travelling since 6am and would need a room pronto....with reluctance a room was found. it was lovely, however, london was 32c and the room had no airconditioning! i politley exaplined that we would require the rrom to have functional aircon and reminded them that there is medical evidence to support that infants sleeping in rooms above 18c are at risk of cot death and once more with reluctance the supervisor suggested a new room would be found. | we returned to the room one hour later after a walk around penhalligons in covent garden and discovered that our luggage (which was in the previous room ) had gone missing! we had reservations for afternoon tea in the thames foyer at 1630hrs, it was now 1610hrs with only 20 mins to get changed and refreshed. with no sign of the luggage i returned to reception and their very helpful customer relations manager (isabelle) comp'd the afternoon tea and arranged for our luggage to appear and a suite to be arranged. | after tea i thought all my christmasses had come at once. the suite was fantastic with a view directly over the london eye. the room was hot but we were assured the aircon worked.....famous last words. at 9pm the room was a sauna and my ""grobag"" thermometer showed that the room was far too hot for our son to sleep in....over 27c. once more called down to reception and minutes later 3 fans arrived!!!!!!!!!! | martino the night manager was fantastic, even to the point of assissting in finding us alternative hotel accomodation. we were at 11pm....phew...in bed in the smallest room in the hotel, not what i had booked, but with functional aircon. he informed me that the whole hotel had had no aircon for the past three days and only some rooms were now working. | i beleived that the staff should have had the integrity to inform us of this at time of check-in. our first night was a disaster and the following night (also complementary as a result) was tinged bitter sweet. with health and safelty issues this hotel needs to remeber that its customers comfort is priority. people may visit the savoy on the basis of its great name (and location) but they also want to have the facilities advertised functional and to hand. this did not happen on our stay and as a result, more so, of the unforthcoming reception staff my family will not be returning. | however, the restaurant staff...thames foyer, riverview and the grill are superb and cannot be faulted. a pity the reception staff could not take a leaf out of their book.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''my partner and i stayed at the rembrandt hotel on march 3rd for one night. to start with i am not one to complain but was thoroughly dissapointed with so many aspect of my stay. we checked in and went to our room, we opened the door and the room stunk of smoke...after requesting a non-smoking room, the room was a real dissapointment, it was no better than a travel lodge. we requested a spa bath when we booked which we did have in our room on arrival but one of the function knobs was broken and it did not really work properly. also, the radio in the bathroom did not work. the only good aspect about the room was the huge bed which was comfortable. after a dissapointing start, later that evening we wanted to use the pool, which was the main reason i chose that hotel, we found out that the use of the pool was not included in the price of our stay (170.00) and it would cost 15 to use the pool for one day! that evening we went down to eat in the resturant to find that we were unable to due to a wedding reception being held in there. we were so angry that we had not been informed of this when booking or on arrival to the hotel. in the morning the brekfast was cold and not what you would expect from a suposed luxury hotel. this is just some of the many things that made our stay at the hotel an awful one. to top it all off the staff were rude and not helpful at all. i will not be recommending this hotel that is for sure!'''",0

The Savoy,"'''i took my mum and sister to the savoy for my mum's birthday, as it had just been through a major refurbishment and was one of the most highly regarded afternoon teas in london. it is beautiful inside, and rather grand with a lovely atmosphere. however, the service we received during our afternoon tea was absolutely appalling. | once seated we were served our tea, which was lovely, but then we literally waited for about 45 minutes before the waitor came over and poured the last of the tea from the pot into my cup, but by then it was stone cold! i asked if we could have some warm tea so he brought over a fresh pot but my cup was full of cold tea then so i had no cup to use. i shared some of my sisters tea whilst waiting for the waitor to come back over, but of course he did not come over to check if we were ok, so i had to go and ask for another cup. we had no milk left but the waitor did not think to check that either. we waited a very long time between food; there was no flow unlike most afternoon teas. we literally felt like we might as well have been inconveniencing him by being there. part way through we even spoke to the manager who had a brief word with the waitor, but his attitude towards us did not change at all. | my mum was, of course, literally burning up whilst sitting there, and it completely ruined her birthday. we have been to many recommended afternoon tea establishments, such as the ritz, the ivy and the dorchester, and yet the service at the savoy was simply disgraceful for the amount of money we paid. | the whole experience still angers me when i think about it as we spent over 200, including a service charge of over 40!!!! i think it would not have been as bad if they had offered to disregard the service charge but it was just very poorly handled in my opinion. let us just say i would not recommend going for afternoon tea at the savoy and we will not be going back.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''very very very bad services. the staff as well as management are impolite and rude. the main important to all customers that need to be respectful by the hotel, but the hotel does not care about his clients. rooms are very small and not clean. i will not repeat this stay'''",0
The Savoy,"'''having stayed at the london savoy in the past, i eagerly anticipated my recent visit to the newly renovated savoy in march, 2011. the hotel has never looked better. specacular! the changes that were made were subtle and really polished up this icon of london hotels. there were however, some really unforgivable mistakes. our butler oliver offered to make dinner reservations for me. he left a typed card in my room, confirming the date, time and location of my dinner reservation. when i arrived at the restaurant, there was no record of my reservation. i returned to the hotel and discussed the situation with the concierge, who told me that there was no record of my request in ""the log."" i showed her my typed confirmation card and she basically told me that the butler must have made an error. i never received any kind of explaination and the butler, who delivered my breakfast for the next two mornings, never said one word!! i spoke with the hotel manager who told me that things like this just did not happen. he made me feel that it was my fault that the reservation was not made...even though i had a lovely, typed confirmation on a thick piece of hotel cardstock. i told him that this kind of error had never happened during any of my past stays at the savoy and all he told me was that they ""had a wonderful product and that the service was impeccable."" not so... in addition, the lights in my room went out three times during 5 days, each time requiring an engineer to get them on again. one morning the water from the taps ran dark brown. on some days we were given the luxury of washcloths and hand towels...most days we were denied...even after asking both the butler and housekeeping. one morning the housekeeper knocked on the door and wanted to know when we would like the room cleaned. i told her we would be out of the room in about 30 minutes. well, we took a bit longer to leave than expected and when she knocked again, i told her were were running late and to please give us about 20 more minutes...her response??? she rolled her eyes at me! bottom line...way too many mistakes for a hotel that prides itself on flawless service...it is past reputation is no longer deserved.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''my husband and i have for sometime wanted to visit the savoy, especially since the very expensive renovations (220 million in total i believe) and we were very much looking forward to experiencing afternoon tea in the thames foyer. now it should be said that my husband and i have experienced afternoon tea at a number of prestigious hotels in london, so the savoy had a lot to live up to, but we were confident as we had heard such good reports in the past - oh how wrong could we be! | we got a last minute table on the day we went (we were on a waiting list) and were told that we had to arrive on time - 3.30pm to be exact. so my husband and i turned up at exactly 3.30pm to be told, without any apology, that the table was not ready and that we would have to wait. all the seating in the immediate area were taken as other people were waiting for tables too; not a good start. we waited for a total of 15-20 minutes before we were finally seated; by this point both my husband and i were very unhappy. i think that our mood was very evident because we were offered a complimentary glass of champagne for having to wait so long - but as far as we were concerned, the damage was done. | as for the afternoon tea itself - well i choose the high tea (more savoury items on the menu), while my husband opted for the traditional afternoon tea. | in both cases, the sandwiches were dry; make that very dry with my husbands as he cannot eat mustard or horseradish. very plain and boring fillings made us feel as if the sandwiches had been bought at a local supermaket - not made fresh from the famous savoy kitchens. my next courses of scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, followed by crumpets were fine but were nothing special or flavourful. | my husband scored better with his next selections - the scones (fruit and plain) came with the usual toppings (jam and clotted cream) but also with a very good homemade lemon curd. an unusual thing to spread on your scones, but it worked very well. all in all they were excellent. he then had a selection of pastries to choose from - of which he had all... and loved them all. a selection of three cakes on a trolley was offered to both of us (a rich chocolate cake, victoria sponge and fruit cake) but either of us had room to eat anymore. | tea and coffee: now i am not a tea drinker but my husband is and the blend he choose was quite excellent (his words). however, when my pot of filter coffee arrived it was not until i got half way through my first cup that i realised that the filter had a big hole in it and lots of coffee grounds found it is way into my cup... and my mouth! how 'bitterly' disappointing! | it should be pointed out that when i booked i stated that i had a nut allergy - at no point during any of the courses being presented to us was i told that any of the foods contained nuts, when clearly i could see that some did! | lastly i have to address the level of service given - firstly please see the paragraph above. surely our waitress should of remembered my allergy, especially when i repeated to her when we sat down... but then again we did not see much of her for the rest of the meal! secondly, it took ages to be served each course - of course no-one wants to be rushed but having to wait with empty plates on our table for up to 10-15 minutes for each course is not on. yes the thames foyer was busy, but if you cannot handle the number of guests coming through your doors, then maybe you need to re-think about how many people you can serve in one sitting. | there are so many different disappointments to mention to our visit to the savoy that it makes me question if we will ever go back. i did want to complain to a senior manager but i could not find anyone to help me and we were short on time as we had tickets to the theatre that night. | i only hope the management from the savoy reads this review and takes appropriate action!'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''my partner and i were spending a sunday night in london before a long flight the following day and she opted to book us into the dorchester based on its exceptional reputation and its high ratings for its afternoon tea. this was our first--and last--stay at the dorchester. we were hoping that this hotel could become our new go-to in london (my partner is a native londoner, and we are there quite frequently) but sadly, this grand old hotel is no longer up to snuff. | our first interaction was with the doorman, who was gracious, removed our luggage from the taxi for us, and provided a warm, unobtrusive welcome--precisely what you would expect. our bags were moved for us (i mention this only because some of the other reviewers had issues getting their baggage handled) and we were then moved on to the front desk. | the young woman at the front desk was polite, but did not remember to introduce herself. she seemed to have an extremely difficult time figuring out how to charge my partner's card, then attempted to put through a higher pre-authorization on the card, which was then declined (we keep a card with a small limit specifically as a safety against fraud, and since they had *already* pre-authorized the card for the room rate and now attempted to pre-authorize it again for the same amount, it was declined). this appeared to because the woman more confusion, and finally i just handed over one of my own credit cards for only the 200 pre-authorization. (reading other reviews, it appears that they had not had a 200 pre-authorization on top of the pre-authorization for the room itself unless they booked with a debit card.) all in all, check-in was far from smooth and appeared extremely amateur at best. more on the card issues--which were worse than what appeared to be incompetent fumbling--later. | she gave us a very perfunctory tour--we stood in the center of the lobby and she pointed in the directions where things were located. we did ask whether we would be able to have tea the same day, and they did squeeze us in with little fuss--but still the hint of ""we are doing you a favour"", not something you want at this level of hotel. the woman who checked us in then took us to our room, and a few minutes later our bags appeared with a young gentleman who very heavily hinted at wanting a tip--while i am happy to tip for service, i refuse on principle when someone looms over me and lingers in expectation, and practically has to be asked to leave the room when two women are in it. he hovered by the bed, i waited for him at the door. rude, and unprofessional. also a touch menacing. | the room itself was pleasant. i found it interesting that complimentary water was not available. while we did have a view towards some duct work, we were on the 5th floor and this limited the damage (and eliminated the potential noise). a minor quibble is that the slippers provided were both huge (we are both women, and do not wear a men's size 44) as were the bathrobes. it would be nice to have sizing preferences asked for in advance. since we were staying only one night, we did not inquire as to whether other sizes were available. | we dressed for tea but found that most people did not. we waiteded for several minutes by a middle eastern camera crew and press team in full swing--very odd, and at first had two waiters, a blond-haired man and a dark-haired man, but the blonde disappeared and we were left in the darker-haired waiter's very capable hands. he was polite, friendly, charming: perfect. when he did not know the answer to a question, he quickly found someone who did. while after a day of transit we did not mind sitting around for three hours, it did seem as though tea service was very understaffed. there were lulls in service where someone could have topped up our tea etc that seemed to be caused by too few servers for too many tables, though the place was not completely full. | since our decision to stay here was heavily swayed by sunday tea reviews, we had high expectations. we opted for the dorchester high tea with champagne. unfortunately, the food was extremely underwhelming. sandwiches were bland, and too large for high tea. they were offered at least three times (which we declined), perhaps a nod to people coming in for a full meal, which is not what tea is about. the impression was one of wanting to ""fill you up"" with heavy, bland sandwiches. | our mains were likewise bland and underwhelming, and my partner left almost all of hers. scones and accompaniments appeared next. i found the scones too eggy and dense, though the home-made jams and cornish cream were lovely. the desserts were an utter disaster: flavourless cherry-based gelee in a waxy chocolate cup, a lime and strawberry tart with pastry so hard we abandoned it altogether (perhaps someone left it in the mixer?), a soggy macaron, some sort of chocolate brownie with plasticky raspberry topping. the only edible cake was a coconut sponge with mango coulis, which was only fine--not exceptional. | the tea itself was left to over-steep, and the initial bitter note of the first-flush darjeeling told me that it had been steeped in water which was too hot (something one should never do to a more delicate tea). we were left utterly underwhelmed by everything but the service at tea, and it was an atrocious value for the quality of the meal itself. i cannot fathom how the dorchester continues to win awards if that is the sort of food it provides. | after tea, we went out for the evening and returned late at night. turn-down service had been provided in the interim. while the bathroom was mostly clean, there was noticeable blue toothpaste splatter on the marble backdrop on one of the sinks. (our toothpaste was white; this was from a previous guest.) the glass door on the tub/shower combination did not keep water from spraying all over the floor during the course of a shower. | i am not sure what sort of water softener the dorchester uses, but the water was extremely, unpleasantly soft--used to london's water, we were both baffled by how soft the water in the hotel was, and neither of us had a positive experience in the shower because of it. (filmy feeling left on our skin, hair dried out, etc.) the toiletries provided were fine, not exceptional, and we were left wishing we had packed our own. | we ordered breakfast to be delivered the following morning and settled in for a lovely night's rest. that is one thing i can say was a clear positive. the mattress was just firm enough, the pillows lovely, and the duvet appropriately-selected for the season. (i do agree with another reviewer saying that the sheets were starched within an inch of their life and therefore not soft, but this was not a problem for us.) namely, the bed was what you would expect at a luxury hotel. this was about the only thing at the dorchester that met (rather than exceeded) five-star standards. | breakfast arrived on-time. pancakes and waffles were ok, and warm, though not exceptional; my request for fresh mango was honoured with a mango which was a bit hard (another menu option had fresh mango standard, so i thought they would have ripe mango ready to go). the bircher muesli was far too sweet and the coffee was absolutely undrinkable--stale, pre-ground, awful. | check-out was a disaster. we ended up standing awkwardly at the desk for a good half hour (i am glad we timed our departure to the airport early) as our card details were once again fumbled, this time by three separate people. i had a feeling of dread about the whole process and this is where the true face of the dorchester's failed front desk infrastructure shows: my card (the one i gave permission to use for the 200 pre-authorization and nothing else) was pre-authorized for the 200 pre-authorization, the cost of the room, and then charged (correctly) for tea and breakfast. i at no point gave the dorchester permission to pre-authorize me for the room, which my partner booked, and for which they pre-authorized her card twice. | i was at no point told that i would be pre-authorized for the room rate. my name did not appear on the booking. i cannot fathom how this is even legal, and have never had anything similar happen anywhere in the world. i find it appalling and in extremely poor taste. calling the young front desk staff incompetent is about the kindest word i can find, and i am baffled at the dorchester's management permitting that sort of service to be their ""face."" reading other reviews, it appears that a blatant misunderstanding of payment etiquette is the norm at this hotel. | overall, this appears to be a grand hotel past its prime. we are contacting the management to express our concerns, but that does not change the fact that we will not be staying at the dorchester again. london offers many hotels in this category, and one good waiter and a comfortable bed (which i would consider the bare basics at a hotel such as this rather than something exceptional) do not make up for terrible front desk service and other shortfalls which make the dorchester only vaguely acceptable as a place to spend the night, presuming you do not mind unauthorized charges to your card, and a terrible value for your money. | follow-up: we received the following e-mail from ms richter at the front desk: ""i clearly remember the situation as i was one of the two receptionists who were involved in your check-in and i was also the one who showed you to your room. therefore, i hope i can she would some light on the situation and offer a genuine explanation. i must apologize for the inconveniences caused to you and your friend as it can be entirely put down to a miscommunication error on our side. the total authorization needed for your stay amounted to xxx which included the room rate of xxx, 20% vat and 200 for incidentals. as a result i authorized xxx on your credit card and 150 on your friends credit card. the additional authorization on your friends credit card of xxx was authorized thinking we were not holding enough authorization and without the knowledge of the first authorization on your credit card. i have taken the steps of having the authorization on your and your friends credit cards released and they will be available to you within a couple of days. i would like to apologize for this mistake and i hope we can welcome you or your friend to the dorchester again in the future."" | read for yourself and consider whether a ""miscommunication error"" (not knowing, despite my partner telling them, that the card had already been pre-authorized) gives them permission to place a hold on someone else's card *without their consent*. it is curious that this came from the front desk, and not from management--and tells me that management does not see this as a problem.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''we were terribly excited to be staying at one of the world's most iconic hotels when visiting london for an awards ceremony. the hotel is truly beautiful with wonderful dcor. it is sadly let down by a rather snobby attitude of some of the staff. on check-in i mentioned to the receptionist that our previous stays in canada had not been credited to our presidents membership card and that i had received no response to an online request some time ago - although he said he would look into this, he did not. the room was very nice, although, to be honest, not as good as other hotels we have stayed in. | we had cocktails in the famous american bar, which were lovely and the staff there very good, although we were made to wait for a table when others were ushered straight through and given a much nicer table (did we look shabby in evening dress and dj?). | the turndown service removed the cups but did not replace them, so in the morning we called housekeeping to have some sent up. they appeared 20 minutes later and were simply handed to me at the door, not even brought up on a tray and with no apology. | we had breakfast in kaspars where we were made to feel a little like second rate guests. no cups on the table, no properly being seated with your napkin placed, no real welcome. a great fuss was made of a nearby table of american guests who had clearly been staying a little while. the toast was stone cold, the bacon had clearly been pre-cooked and was also not hot, one sad flat mushroom and some of the pastries were very dry. at 32, given the article about breakfasts in the times the day before you would think they could do better. | the nicest person in the hotel was the doorman, who took care of our luggage and gave us some ideas to fill the couple of hours we had free. he was friendly and helpful and not at all snobby. | sadly this was not the unique and special stay we had hoped for and had eagerly anticipated - a bit of a let down to say the least.'''",0

Rhodes Hotel,"'''i had stayed recently in that hotel may 27th-30th, i am not very satisfied with ambience, long stairs. though it is very near to the paddington station and other benefits cannot be overlooked, but comfort and behavior are the two main important factors for any service industries. breakfast was simple and fresh. | i really had a bad experence on the last day of our stay. we were told that check out time is at 11 am. after the breakfast we went out for a stroll in nearby areas and came back to hotel at 10.15 for check out. on return we were shocked to find our luggages were lying outside the room like an orphan. there was hardly any space between the stair and the lobby. only one person can pass at a time. when i asked the manager the reason, he told me very rudely that the room does not belong to us anymore. he could not answer 11 am check out time. i asked him to open the room as i need to use the toilet, he did it. the condition of the room was pathetic. the beds were folded, the toilets was dumped with many things......complete horrible and pathetic situation. but i had no option other than using the toilet in such condition. they even threw the water bottles kept on the table. while leaving the hotel i informed them that we will be back by 10.30, the person at the reception said ok and we came back 15 mins before the time still we had to face such annoying and degrading situation. it gave a feeling of sheer insult. | i would suggest there are many good hotels nearby, you can stay over there but not rhodes.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''an incredible, old-school london hotel... with a great location for exploring london's theater district; excellent old world interior feel...but overpriced in every aspect and when you get to the fit and finish of things, falling short of other modern 5* accommodations. the staff all are personable and friendly, but often lacking in how to respond to guest needs or issues. the rooms are not well setup for modern day travelers (usb ports, multiple plugs for devices near the bed, etc.); and the food for such a grand stay is in the middle of the road instead of showcasing the best london has to offer. we desperately wanted the savoy to live up to the legend, instead, the overall experience felt overpriced, lacking in convenience or quality, and that they are living on reputation vs. execution. too bad.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel was in a great location, but the carpet was tattered, bed linens were a bit scary and staff kept giving me conflicting information. i was there for 3 nights in an old room with very little natural light. the breakfast was nice and the dining area was obviously updated a couple of decades after my room. on the plus side, it was in a good neighborhood and i felt comfortable walking around by myself at night. the front desk personnel would tell me one thing and the consierge would tell me the opposite, so they were not very helpful. for the price i expected much better. i would probably check around for another hotel on my next stay in london.'''",0
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we were told that we had been upgraded to a ""superior"" room, which when we saw it, had us wondering what kind of dungeon our first room might have been. the room was so small you could only access the bed from one side, and on that side, you could not stand up straight for fear of hitting your head on the slanted wall/ceiling. after the room had been serviced, not all the dirty bath linens had been removed, and of those that had been, not all were replaced. there are plenty of other hotels in the immediate neighborhood that offer much better value at lower prices.'''",0

Rhodes Hotel,"'''this terrible basement room did not look like the beautiful photos that we had seen on the rhodes hotel homepage. the rhodes hotel is cheating their guests. there was a gaslike smell on the corridor stairs that led down to the deep basement. the tiny room was dark and no light was coming through the window. when we opened the window a stench of smoke came in to the room. it was freezing cold outside, but the aircon and radiator did not work. besides there was an awful stench of mould from the bathroom. these rooms in the basement really have the potential of ruin your holiday!'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we thought we would treat ourselves to an impromptu stopover because we had a really great experience the first time we stayed here. sadly this was not the case on this occasion. the matre d in the thames foyer was so rude we felt uncomfortable taking tea in there. our room had the most depressing view-a soot covered internal back of house view of what looked like the kitchens with a dead pigeon. the towels in our room were dirty. there was no water or turn down service offered. only part of our in-room dining order arrived and was spoilt whilst we called to complain and had to wait for the rest to come. all in all, not what i would expect from a hotel of this calibre. very disappointing!'''",0
The Savoy,"'''prostituting the past | the savoy has a global reputation as a five star deluxe hotel with impeccable standards. we have just stayed there for five nights after its multi-million pound refurbishment. | horror upon horror!!! this is now a hotel run by accountants desperate to recoup the purchase and renovation costs. it is part of an american chain and has sold the family silver. my prediction is that it will be sold off in a few years as the costs mount thank heavens for market forces, as that is the only possibility of it returning towards former glories. if you want the full sickening story, read on but you will need a strong stomach. | the beautiful and iconic riverside restaurant has gone, to be replaced by kaspars which more closely resembles an american diner. this is where you have an early breakfast and we were greeted by a waiter saying hi guys, are you having a good day. he was totally perplexed when i told him that my name was sir, my partners was madam and that we were in england, not in the usa. there is no buffet (i like to make my own choices at breakfast) and we had to ask for plain muesli specifically. this arrived long after my cooked breakfast. the coffee was indifferent and there were either six waiters or none. | another strong memory was our room. given that the hotel was not very full and on past reputation, we were expecting great things. although this was allegedly a deluxe room, it was small in the extreme. the heating was set at american levels and it took 24 hours with all the windows open to reach normal european levels. there was one miniscule wardrobe so we were forced to keep most of our clothes in our suitcases. there was no mirror and adjacent power point for ladies to preen or do their hair. the bathroom was the best feature but the toiletries were american, disgusting and gave no clue as to contents great for allergy sufferers. the toilet paper was thin and economy mode. there were no sanitary bags or disposal facilities. | we had to take it in turns to move around the bedroom, as there was no space to pass side by side. cleaners appeared between 8 and 830 each morning despite being told on each occasion that it was too early for us. similarly the voluntary turn down service seemed to operate from 9 in the evening and ignored our request to remain undisturbed - no bedtime chocolates much to the other halfs disgust. i definitely prefer holiday inn express to this and shudder to think what a standard room must be like. what is the opposite of cosseting? | given that our bedroom was so unwelcoming, we thought we would try the lounge. this is totally unavailable between 1pm and 7pm as it is used to serve afternoon tea (at a cost) to the masses, in addition to kaspars. this is definitely the place to be if you want to compare dirty jeans, trainers and the constant flashing of mobile phone cameras. the attitude of some of the staff and their inability to clean their shoes were another highlight. later breakfast is available here in limited numbers and represents a glimpse of civilisation when you manage to find some of the, rare, serving staff who belong in a five star hotel. the coffee is a distinct improvement (french press). | the alternative seating area/lounge is the echoing entrance foyer which has a few uncomfortable sofas. we sat in our overcoats, freezing and were told that no refreshments are served there. the door to the savoy grill was left open and allowed further arctic gusts to penetrate. my request to the grill staff to keep the door shut was met with surly surprise and only complied with after a lengthy exchange of views. | we were told the recommended alternative is the american bar (again re-modelled with little reference to past glories). this is noisy, crowded, expensive, involves directed seating and is far from a relaxing oasis. we took one look and decided to go outside the hotel anywhere. | surprisingly for an operation that is so obviously run by accountants (or maybe as a direct result if one is cynical) our bill was incorrect. we were charged for drinks we had not had and the one nights deposit demanded in advance was not shown. | we raised all these (and other) issues with senior management at the time. the response was embarrassing as none had any concept of what the savoy or any other major five star hotel should represent. i started feeling almost sorry for them, but that soon disappeared when i remembered that we paid a four figure sum for the whole experience. a bottle of champagne did appear with an illiterate note but this was the only note of apology. | would we stay again? - only if every other hotel within a fifty mile radius of london was closed and we were utterly desperate. on second thoughts, a bench at heathrow airport would probably be preferable.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''this hotel needs $50m spent on it to re-qualify as 5-star. the rooms &amp; amenities are incredibly old &amp; tired. i stayed at the savoy in the middle of a london heatwave &amp; the air-conditioning in my room did not work. the toilet did not flush at all initially &amp; even after repeated attempts to repair it, it did not flush consistently. the battery in the safe went flat so i could not retrieve my passport when it came time to check-out. far from being attentive, i found the service pretentious &amp; insincere. i felt annoyed &amp; imposed upon when a different member of staff knocked on my door every 90 minutes to ask if ""everything was ok with the room"". especially as they were not the least bit responsive or helpful when everything was not ""ok"". between the constant knocking &amp; repeated attempts to repair the air-conditioning, the toilet &amp; the safe, i felt like a member of staff was in my room 80% of the time that i was. the savoy trades on its stately reputation, but it is no longer deserved.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''i regret that i have to write this report but felt totally humiliated by the way i was treated on a recent visit to the savoy. my wife dr mitchell had been attending a medical conference at savoy place, next to the savoy hotel, so after the conference had finished we decided to pay a visit to the savoy having recently seen the programme on tv. on entering the hotel we asked a member of staff if it was possible to have a drink and were duly directed to the american bar. a young lady said that at this time there was a twenty minute wait, no problem i said, since my wife had had a very busy day, we were both looking forward to some relaxation time. having been told about the wait, the young girl then very rudely looked at me and said anyway you cannot come in with shoes like that !! i hasten to say i was wearing a very expensive new season pair of shoes from dune, i am sure dune would not be happy to be told there shoes are not fit for the savoy ? to be treated like that in front of other medical colleagues was very embarrassing, where is the customer service. i dare say if my name had been david beckham a table would have been made available even if he had been wearing his football boots!! | we left the savoy and returned to the london hilton metropole executive lounge where they truly know how to look after their clients even in dune shoes!!'''",0
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''this hotel is in decent location for museums area in london and inside it is clean and nicely decorated but the room we had was absolutely tiny - which is why overall score is low. it was not possible to walk all around the very small double bed that was crammed into a room which really should be only for a single. trying to negotiate a tiny room and equally tiny bathroom space does not really make for a great start, we had to decide who was going to get dressed first so we did not bump into each other- that is how small our room was !! we also had problems initially in accessing our room- 3 times in total- as the key are would not work. not impressed.'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''my family and i stayed at the ridgemount hotel in january 2009 for a week. although the price was quite reasonable for a london hotel the quality suffered enormously. we stayed on the top floor of the hotel and there are issues i would like to report. | 1. we were promised an en-suite room. however, the room did not have a shower and toilet as promised and my family and i had to share with other guests. | 2. the shared shower on the top floor was clearly faulty and was either freezing cold or boiling hot so clearly unsafe. we was then told that we had to go downstairs to use the showers. | 3. the noise levels in the room from the street outside were very high. | 4. being right at the top of the hotel caused a struggle to my family and i because of all the stairs and there is no lift. | 5. the breakfast in the morning is not a full english breakfast. they always missed something out. how can you have a full english breakfast without tomatoes? | 6. i asked many times for morning wake up call and it was never done. | 7. the beds on the room were old and too hard. | 8. the most important thing that concerned me was that after many of these problems were reported the owners seemed unwilling to move us to another room and help sort out the issues we had. they were very rude and clearly against offering any sort of discount and seemed to take comfort by the fact that they had already taken my money. so in future i will take my custom elsewhere.'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we spent four days in sept at the ridgemount, based upon the good reviews on tripadvisor. | on arrival we were accompanied to our room by a very polite young man who apologised for the size of the room, before we even opened the door. small would be an understatement. we appreciate that accommodation in london is expensive so the going rate of 75 pounds was probably fair. | our real problem was that the room fronted on to gower street which is a major bus corridor in to london. a constant stream of double decker buses hiking past the hotel, made for a very unpleasant night's sleep. we requested a change of room to the back of the hotel, after the first night, but this was not possible. we left exhausted and would never go near there again.'''",0
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i spent four days at the hotel. it is then the last time i live there. | i have never stayed in a small room, and i travel about 50 days a year around the world. | in addition to room size, i feel ripped off, it can not be true that one can take 144 pounds to rent a ""broom closet"" out. | i was on a business trip, the most important thing for me was a desk and internet. | the desk was impossible to sit at. the chair could not be pulled out from the table due to shortage of space in the room. then why use the room for a chair that is impossible to sit at? internet was uneven and largely non-existent at times when i needed it. early in the evening. in addition, i sat askew at the desk, which resulted in held in the neck and back. | i would like to challenge the hotel manager to sit at the desk in room 507 for an hour and work at a computer and then tell me what an experience it has been. | so my advice would be fewer rooms, otherwise it will be a problem that will follow this hotel.and it is quite too bad, since both the location and the rank and file staff works extremely friendly. however, not any executive who could not see the problem with the desktop, which i complained several times.'''",0

London Guest House,"'''the room was clean but had a funny smell, bathroom tiny and no cold water at sink, no lift so a bit of a hassle carrying bags up 4 flights of stairs, room noisy as it overlooked a main road and no double glazing. | breakfast was very basic - beans and scrambled egg on a hotplate that look as if they could have been there for days, toast and yoghurts. | the area was very run down and there were no local restaurants to eat at, had to walk over 2 miles to 'high street' which felt like taking your life in your hands when it was dark. | fair to say i will not be staying again!'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''the air conditioning in our room was working on the 1st night even though it was loud. the 2nd night it could not be switched on at all but no one came to fix it after a few hours we reported the issue. when we requested to change to a different room but we were treated as if we were some troublemakers by the rude night shift manager called dickson. this person has no customer service skills and simply do not care about customers. he was even challenging us and started an argument. there were other rooms available but this manager would not let us change the room in the first place. firstly, the potter was sent to find out why the air conditioning was not working. he said it was due to electrical problem and he would find us a fan but he could not get one. he then came back again to switch off the vent which was making loud noise. i spoke to dickson but before listening to what i had to say he ""kindly"" offered us his personal tiny dusty dyson fan to us. the potter brought it to us and there was no cool air but only hot air coming out. this would not be a solution because there was no air circulation in the room and the room was already warm! we had to speak to dickson again but he told us there was no other rooms available. we mentioned that there was double room available on the hotel website and he went on to challenge us whether we think he is lying? (is this how you should speak to customers? we were just telling you what we found!) he then asked the potter to bring us to a downgraded twin room which was smaller, older, darker and one bathroom light was out. we were not happy with this and finally dickson showed up and bring us to another room. bear in mind, this was already after midnight (it all happened between 11pm-1am) and we were still not able to take our rest!! i also feel sorry for the next door guests. it was very disappointing that such a small issue could not be dealt with promptly. what did you have to lose to offer us an unoccupied room on our last night stay in the first place even if it is an upgraded one given all the inconvenience plus it was already midnight?! feel free to contact me if you need any further details!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i had booked this superior double room as we had been invited to a function at the science museum and was really looking forward to our stay. however, what a disappointment it turned out to be. the room was tiny, the double bed pushed up against a wall, only one chair round a very small table which had no room on it once the magazines were displayed. room service meant that my partner had to sit on the bed to eat. | we complained to reception who showed us an alternative room of similar proportions and as our luggage was in the room had to accept that this was going to be the best on offer. the general manager was unable to offer a better alternative as the hotel was fully booked apparently. many other couples in our company had booked at a similar time ahead of the visit and their rooms were better proportioned. a decent hotel would have offered compensation, all the receptionist offered was a possible upgrade if we returned to the hotel, which we will not be doing. all in all, a night to be remembered for all the wrong reasons.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i have been told by many friends that how amazing corinthia is. however, my own experience was very disappointing, in particular the service on housekeeping and restaurants. | good points : we arrived at 12am but managed to check in straight away. the reception and the concierge was very professional and personal at check-in. the room is well proportioned with a jubilee balcony facing inner courtyard. it was very quiet during my stay. the balcony makes a huge difference and in my view it was the best superior rooms (standard room) i ever stayed. | bad points: 1) the comfort cooling in my room seems not working properly as the room got very hot in the night due to the underfloor heating. 2) i asked for dental kits which were never delivered to my room. i assume they forgot this as i asked for those 3 hours before i was scheduled to check out 3) the housekeeping broke my belt buckle when they did turndown service 4) check-out was very unprofessional. 5) restaurant staff were cold and unprofessional. 6) the cocktails in the bar were in my opinion overpriced and average quality. 7) the service at their best was standard 5 star quality but fall short of being personal and special. | the services vary in different departments. the check-in was very pleasant but 1) the housekeeping was terrible not only they forgot to provide my dental kits but they also broke my belt buckle. 2) the restaurant service were cold and unprofessional. i made a reservation but decided to leave after i found nothing fancy on the menu. when i walked out, i was told by the waitress they had to charge a bottle of still water to my room bill. the water was offered while i was looking through the menu and i did not know that it was still water and payable, so i refused to accept this charge and did not sign any bill (in fact, no bill was presented to me at any time for charging this bottle of still water). when i checked out, the 5 pound water appears in my bill. this is very unprofessional. the principle is that if the customer does not sign the bill to acknowledge any incidental charge, the hotel should not just put a charge against under room bill straight away (not to mention that this charge was very debatable). the charge was eventually removed on my request when i checked out 3) the check-out staff was unprofessional. i booked this hotel through lastminute.com promotion offer (it is about value for money after all - nothing to be ashamed of if you can get a good deal) and my booking with last mintue.com stipulate that my card was charged at the time of booking. however, it appears that the charge has not been made to the hotel from lastminute.com yet so the hotel staff kept asking me to pay for the room rate (from check in till check out). when i checked out, i explained the situation again and the reception demanded me to send my lastmintue.com booking confirmation and terms &amp; condition to hotel reception email for record. this is very unprofessional and unacceptable. the issue of payment was the matter between the hotel and its travel agent. i have acknowledged to pay under my booking with last minute.com so it is only just a matter of when and how this will be paid to the hotel. on the basis that i have pre-authorisation circa 400 pound when i checked in, such bothering to a customer at this level was a very poor and unprofessional behavior and very bad customer service for a branded luxury hotel. so far my pre-authorisation have not been released but the bill for my stay was settled, i do hope that if there is an payment issue between the lastminute.com and the corinthia hotel, the hotel will have the dignity to contact me first before charging the room rate against my pre-authorisation without my consent.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''the quality is not good! i stayed here one week.the equipment room is old, we had to fix toilet. the hotel is near from central line metro and maybe 400 metrs from hotel is bus station. wifi does not in room! this hotel i can not recommend.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i am a regular visitor to 5 star hotels all over the world and especially in london. | i decided to treat some of my staff to a meal and overnight stay in london and thought it might be nice to give the savoy a try for a change. i had stayed there many years ago before it was refurbished but never since. when in london we normally stay at hotels such as claridge's, the connaught and the dorchester and i was expecting the savoy to be of a similar calibre to these hotels. | i was beginning to have some early doubts during the booking process. i was booking a total of 7 rooms, including a 2-bedroom suite for my family, with some being for one night and others for two. | it took me six days to make the booking. email response times from the reservations department were appallingly slow with it taking over 24 hours for them to reply to each email. i was not provided with a full range of suite options. despite enquiring about a two-bedroom suite, i was initially given a quote for only a one-bedroom suite. i was then given a quote for two interconnecting suites which would have given me two lounges, something that was not required. the whole booking process was a headache. when i thought i had finally got there, i had to repeatedly ask them to call me for my credit card details to secure the reservation. they initially had indicated that they would like me to email them the details which is very insecure. | when we arrived i was expecting a river view as previously mentioned during the booking process. the river was only just about visible in the distance through a minuscule gap in the trees. | the layout and design of the suite was poor. whilst the amount of floor space was reasonable, there had been no thought placed into where items of furniture or bathroom fittings were placed. | there was no walk-in shower as detailed in the original booking. the shower was within the bath, like a standard economy hotel. whilst there was physically room in the bathroom to add two sinks, only one had been provided. the toilet roll holder was placed some distance from the toilet. | there was a dressing table in the bedroom. instead of placing a mirror above the dressing table there were 2 pictures. there was no power socket with a standard socket next to the dressing table. this meant that there was nowhere in the room for my wife to use her hair straighteners whilst being able to see into a mirror. there were not any other mirrors in the room that were located near a power socket. | at around 6.30am both mornings i could hear a banging noise coming from outside of the room. it was obviously some kind of internal task that was occurring at the same time each day. | on the first night i ordered what is described on the room service menu as 'chicken nuggets with bbq sauce' for my children. when it arrived there was no bbq sauce. | when some of my staff arrived on the second day, they were looking forward to using the hotel's swimming pool. however they were disappointed as it was closed due to a ""chemical imbalance"" | on the final morning we were woken up at 7.45am by banging on the suite door and then the doorbell ringing. my wife got up and answered the door. it was two porters from the hotel asking if they could take our luggage. we had not asked them to take our luggage or disturb us. it transpired that they had been given the wrong room number. | we ordered room service breakfast. my youngest son chose the ""kids boiled egg with soldiers"". when it arrived there were no soldiers and the yolk was completely solid - totally overcooked. | my wife and i ordered poached eggs. again the eggs were annihilated with no runny yolks. | as with most quality hotels, we were asked if we would like a newspaper each morning. we chose the times. however the hotel provided the main section of the newspaper only and not the supplements that are usually provided with it. | i brought all these issues to the attention of the hotel management during my visit, but despite a lot meaningless, hot-air apologies, there was no gesture whatsoever to say sorry. | the suite was certainly not worth the 3000 that i paid for it. in future i will vote with my feet and will not be returning to the savoy. if you are looking for a 5-star hotel experience in london then choose one of the other wide variety of hotels available and do not make the disappointing mistake that we did of choosing the savoy. never again.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''we have stayed at the dorchester before. largely this hotel delivers in terms of the standards of it is accommodation and amenities and you can read about all of that in detail from numerous reviews elsewhere. however one thing really surprised me on our stay this past friday. we stayed in room #130 and from 1030pm until 130am there was a pretty loud function being hosted at the ballroom downstairs. the noise was more than loud enough to prevent us from going to sleep - honestly it was pretty loud! i eventually phoned the night manager at 1230pm and at first he did not know what i was talking about, then advised that the noise was towards ""the upper end of their acceptable range"" and that they were monitoring it, then offered for us to change rooms. i thanked him for the offer, but did not want to get dressed, pack and move at that time of night (especially as we were leaving the next day anyway). | i think that they have a problem with sound proofing from the ballroom, and so recommend asking for a higher floor if available. my main gripe is that we were never informed that a function was going to take place and so could not avoid this ourselves. not great from a hotel of this standard and price.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''my daughter and i have just returned from a weekend at the dorchester and i cannot pretend it was anything but a bit of a disappointment. the hotel lobby is lovely and the staff were extremely nice and very helpful. our room itself was what you would expect in a 5 star hotel, good bed, quality linens and furniture etc. but that was really where it ended. | they brought the wrong luggage to our room which is unforgivable in such an exclusive hotel. but it was sorted. in such an expensive hotel complimentary mineral water really should always be available in the room, especially for those people who have arrived after a long flight but no, not even the ubiquitus chocolates at turndown. | we returned late from the theatre on saturday night and decided to have room service. we tried the number a couple of times before we could get a reply.the food came quite quickly and was ok nothing special, no marks for presentation but it tasted good as we were hungry. | the following morning we looked forward to breakfast in the dining room (and at 28 each we expected something special). sad to say it was very poor. we ordered the english breakfast which consists of one small glass of juice, tea or coffee, cold toast no butter. we ordered poached eggs with bacon and sausage. sadly it was cold and very overcooked, although at the time you try to make the best of it, in truth it was very poor. they never offered us any more coffee or juice or inquired if we had enjoyed our food even though the food was only half eaten. i looked at the stains on the table cloth and no matter how hard i tried to ignore the many faults i had to admit to myself i would not stay here or recommend this hotel to anyone. go for a smaller hotel like dukes or the draycott where attention to detail is just beautiful and they make you feel very special. we paid our bill which of course was incorrect with a 50.00 charge for parking, strange as we had arrived by train and taxi. needless to say quite a few people were questioning their bills, not suprising as when we checked in a man next to us was asking the receptionist can it be true that 4 bottles of house wine on his bill came to 208.00? ""i am afraid so sir "" came the reply. which leaves me only to say you do not always get what you pay for or what you deserve!'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''.if you want to have a good impression about london, better chose another hotel. and is not only because the conditions it offers but also the ghetto this hotel is situated where you can see very strange people and a lot of dirt. also the distance to the city centre is not at 20 minutes how they say, but at list 1 hour. about the hotel, i think it is mostly a worker hotel not a holyday one, very small rooms and bath-rooms, destroyed furniture, doors and carpets. the good think are the free parking, good internet and also i can not complain about room cleaning'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i stayed in the mondrian for 10 days in july-august, 2015. despite its location directly on the thames, the hotel is not well-located for access to the underground or buses, particularly for travelers who wish to move around london at night. the rooms are small and decorated with ugly, plastic ""art."" despite being an ""international"" hotel, only english television stations were offered. it was necessary to ""swipe"" a room key in order to make the elevators work, and it was necessary to swipe repeatedly when guests required access to multiple floors. the fitness room, which i used daily, was poorly laid out, with too many machines crammed into a small space, despite the fact that there was a ""spa"" nearby which seemed to by empty much of the day. housekeeping services were intrusive, with up to three people knocking on my door and entering the room to clean, to check the cleaning, to check the minibar, etc., etc., etc. the wifi was spotty, requiring the user to sign on repeatedly. there is construction of a high-rise going on behind the hotel, which will certainly affect the quiet for years to come (the workers were active on weekends, too). finally, the halls of the hotel are painted dark grey, there are no floor numbers in the halls when one exits the elevators, and the lobby is kept so dark in the evenings that one can barely see. despite the high price, i found the hotel uncomfortable. i compare it to the hotel h-10 at waterloo, not far away, where i stayed in may and had a much more pleasant visit. the high price of the mondrian purchases style, not substance. caveat emptor.'''",0
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''35yrs travelling worldwide in countless hotels, this was the smallest, most uncomfortable two nights spent anywhere in this time. double bed shoe horned into the corner of the room, accessible only from one side and only one side table. i have had more comfortable bunks on ferries! the walls on two sides of the room slope in and restrict space about waist height. being 6ft+++ tall and broad build, i walked sideways between the wardrobe and bathroom wall, this is not a room, it is a closet! | my wife had to climb over me to access the bed or i stood to give her access, incredible that this hotel management classify it as double room (507), read the lowest reviews and see how many have said the same. bathroom was so small that door closure was nearly beyond reach once inside, water pressure at best was a trickle, very poor for a new hotel 3mths old. | housekeeping entered the room and removed our keycard to switch off the ac when we dined out for 3 hrs, returning at 10pm to an oven-closet. well done, nice touch which i addressed on return, not received well though. | room was full of tech gadgets which added to the clutter, hard to comprehend this approach as it is not complimentary to space utilisation in a closet. | avoid the fifth floor if you want a roomier experience. 135 a night plus breakfast just does not seem right. | boutique hotels are supposed to be as the name implies, this one has in my view a new adjective - bunktique. never again.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i love the savoy. the old savoy. | her ladyship and i stayed at the savoy dozens of times between the mid-1980's and the early 1990's (when we purchased a flat in london) and were treated like family. | i once negotiated the purchase of a company on the terrace. a dozen of us celebrated new years overlooking the thames. we networked in the grill room and changed our accountants in the american bar. i loved the man who ran water -- at a perfect temperature -- for me to wash my hands in the gentleman's cloak room. | it was always a pleasure to check-in. | prior to our most recent stay, we would last stayed in the savoy in october 2010 -- a ""soft"" opening following the stg 225 million renovation and upgrade. that stay was a bit bumpy, but the enthusiastic staff were eager to help. | we would stayed elsewhere on return visits to london, simply because we preferred a flat to a hotel room. but on our latest 11 day trip, i thought it would be nice to come back to our old favourite. i used an online booking service and was surprised to find a ""hot deal"" for stg 4,360.50 (including vat) for an 11 night stay in a ""deluxe king room."" that is under stg 400 per night. i guess the fact that the savoy was offering ""hot deals"" should have been a big warning. | i had to contact the concierge twice -- once by e-mail and once by fax -- before i could get a response. i would asked them to arrange a pick-up at heathrow and to assist with a visa. the car was arranged, but they used the data protection act as an excuse to not assist with the visa. i had to then send them names of visa services from a google search . . . | our room was small, overlooked an air shaft, and had a single uncomfortable chair. our bathroom was large, and always hot. we had a problem with the heating in our room (subsequently repaired) and froze on our second night in the hotel. | i simply could not get a decent iced tea from room service, notwithstanding the fact that ice tea is on the menu in the terrace and is served at afternoon tea. her ladyship could not get a latte that was even remotely hot -- and it was impossible for her to get a latte in a tall cup, glass, or mug. after several days of complaining we gave up, and became (essentially) self-sufficient. they sent us, at first, a small refrigerator (an old mini-bar) that would not close, then a larger refrigerator that did. they also provided a small microwave. | her ladyship made me iced tea in the room with the microwave, and she ventured across the strand to get her hot latte, in a tall cup, from the near-by starbucks. i would like to stress that our absolute preference was not to do our own ""cooking"" in the room, but we completely failed to get any sort of satisfaction from hotel management. | alas, this was not for want of complaining. i met, face-to-face, with several duty managers who seemed powerless to help. we met with the director of operations who, in my view, classified us as a pain-in-the-proverbial. he exuded arrogance and self-satisfaction, explaining that the young staff brought ""vibrancy"" to the hotel when we only saw their inexperience. | i even spoke with the hotel gm, kiaran macdonald, but only on the 'phone, and only after i asked his secretary for the name of his boss. mr macdonald told me, ""i am the general manager of the savoy in london, and i know how to make ice tea and a hot latte."" that might well be true, but his staff certainly did not share his skills -- and there was no sign of mr macdonald preparing anything for us himself. | then there is the irritating saga of our lost parcel. we would had a box (of toffee) sent to us at the savoy. it was clearly marked with my name and the strand address. there was no sign of the parcel for several days, so we finally reached out to ask for help. the front desk punted the request to the concierge. the concierge did nothing until we (again) nagged. the parcel was found a couple of hours later, opened, on some loading dock. we were told, incorrectly, that it had arrived that day. it had, in fact, arrived more than 24 hours earlier. rather than simply accepting responsibility for another job poorly done, the concierge and duty manager were filled with excuses: it should not have been delivered to the loading dock, etc. huh? does the savoy actually want parcelforce to drive up to the front of the hotel with their delivery van? | having accepted and signed for the parcel at the loading dock, why did not the savoy staff efficiently transfer the parcel to the front of house? what if it had been a surprise present that we were not expecting? | i could continue to prattle on about the many things that went wrong during our 11 day stay. there were three things that were great: the doormen (who were universally polite and helpful), the housekeeping manager the 5th floor (who tried her best), and the afternoon tea (delicious, and served with elan). | as others have observed on tripadvisor, there are several luxury hotels in london who still offer luxury service at a comparable price. the savoy is a beautiful hotel, in a great location, but we found it staffed by enthusiastic amateurs managed by rather arrogant managers. | what a shame.'''",0
The Rembrandt,'''stayed here for two nights will never stay again | the check in staff were not helpful had two heavy cases no offer of help | breakfast was awful | rooms not very nice bed like a trampoline | staff would need to get some training or else change all staff as they were lazy | one concierge the man from algeria was the only star in the place''',0
The Savoy,"'''the hotel has no iphone charger so when your batt runs out and you are on a business call at night , you will be expected to bring your phone and dock it at the concierge ??? | from front desk to concierge to the duty manager , no one has offered a solution except to come and charge it at the concierge desk, it is appalling for a five star hotel'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''having just read the last review on afternoon tea maybe they had an off day when we were there ? we were really looking forward to a family tea at the corinthian last weekend after being shown to a very nice table we were given menus . it said that the assorted sandwiches are served on speciality breads! what in fact turned up was boring plain white &amp; wholemeal bread ,the sandwiches were very bland the scones were nice but the cakes were very disappointing one would expect more for 200 for four of us with a glass of champagne each .the only saving grace was the excellent service'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''arriving at the well-known dorchester following a hard week-long slog through europe on a marketing trip, i was looking forward to a brief (one night) but relaxing stay at this top-bracket property before heading off to japan. | 6 pm check-in was a bit chaotic, but the lobby and first floor is beautiful, and i was finally conducted to what turned out to be a pleasant room, slightly marred by stains on the carpeting and a collection of hairs in the bathtub. it took 2 calls and almost 30 minutes to the porter to have my bags delivered, despite being assured upon check-in that they would be ""brought up immediately"". | as i was looking forward to a bath, i put in a call to housekeeping to have the bathtub cleaned, but after 20 minutes no one had shown up. after another call and a further 10 minute wait, a perspiring maid finally arrived muttering under her breath whenever the beeper on her belt went off, and cleaned up without enthusiasm. the bathroom fixtures themselves could have used a good polishing, but they worked. | comfortable bed, and very good good room service breakfast. however, the bill for overnight laundry of 5 shirts and underwear tipped the scales at 300 pounds, which seemed a tad high, to say the least. | on saturday, looking to eat lunch at the hotel before heading to heathrow, i presented myself at the main court only to be told (as expected) that the then empty room was fully-booked for high tea and i would have to look elsewhere. my request for help with where to get a light lunch initially resulted in baffled stares, but ultimately the hotel bar was the recommended alternative. the dorchester's bar has been written up as ""one of the best hotel bars"" in london, and if you are looking for a gin and tonic priced at 18 pounds (not including the bottle of tonic, which is extra), thudding eurotrash music, and a strange menu of expensive snacks in a bordello decor, this place is for you. a sloppy wrap of curry chicken salad and one drink set me back over 50 pounds, which is an outrageous price considering what it was. | one could do better at the savoy or claridges for the same | price.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i have stayed and eaten in the ""savoy"" on several occasions, but on this christmas i was apalled | with the number of pack backers wearing sports shoes and grubby jeans, some with children in buggies just walking in unchallenged taking photographs with their i phone's and constantly | getting in the way.it was obvoious christmas meant nothing to them,i thought the ""savoy"" was | a five star hotel not a three star, unless the ""savoy ups it is game we will in future go to a | hotel that doe's. | belvic.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we stayed here for just one sat night in feb 05. stayed in junior river view suite on 8th floor - 816. room was at far left of hotel with good views over to south bank and up river to houses of parliament. spacious entrance lobby, smallish bedroom to left but with oodles of wardrobe and drawer space. very comfortable bed (double not king size though) and excellent pillows. curtains a bit weary looking around the edges but other soft furnishings ok. wardrobes hv seen better days. bathroom - fairly large with good rainfall shower but bit austere and with no wow factor (bathrooms have to have a wow factor for me!). sitting room to left of entrance lobby was large and well furnished but just faintly worn about the edges. metal framed windows were not great - pretty old double glazing affair with flaking mortar and paint in between panes and definitely might be difficult to shut if you did not have strong pair of hands! hum from traffic below was fairly constant but not obtrusive. atmosphere of suite was like staying at home of great aunt - bit faded around the edges but comfortable and homely. corridors of hotel again bashed about the edges a bit, look in need of refurbishment. public areas good - love them or hate them i think - lots of chocolate, beiges and browns. american bar i found disappointing. obviously outrageously expensive but cocktails good - but why should we have to remind waiter after 15 minutes that he had not yet brought the second round of drinks we would ordered - i expect better service than that for 12 a cocktail! savoy grill - fabulous room setting lovely banquettes and circular tables - good ambience and lighting. we had taster menu at 65 per head which was only ok. main course was good (not amazing) but rest of dishes were only ok - how disappointing is that? service was outstanding though. (i have to say that apart from the bar waiters who were pretty poor the entire hotel staff were friendly and extemley professional and helpful). also had lunch in the informal restaurant overlooking entrance - fixed price for 2 or 3 courses - extremley good value and excellent food. would i stay here again? no. at over 350 for the room, over 240 for a meal for 2 (albeit including a bottle of champagne and half bottle of wine) with the final bill for one night's stay coming out at about 800 and when you consider little things like the poor service in the american bar, wrong newspaper delivered to our room, having to wait over 15 minutes for them to bring our car round when we checked out - i have not come away with any special memories except how large that bill was..'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i stayed at the madarin oriental hyde park last night and so shocked am i at its disgraceful standards i had to write a review of it now. i stayed at mohp in light of it is impeccable relative in new york but i was extremely disappointed. we stayed for four nights in the st james suite and were appalled. the fitting and fixtures were rusty, there were stains on the bed and walls, and the cold tap ran hot. | the service was. on the third night of our stay we were told that maintenance would repair the suite tomorrow. one thing to anyone thinking of staying here, ""stay at the lanesborough.""'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''sea containers has been designed and built as a very interesting, modern hotle with some great design. unfortunatley that is were the posotives stop as the hotel operator appears to be style over substance. | young trendy staff in designer uniforms and funky room deisgns does not mean you can automatically deliver great service and food &amp; beverage, which this company cannot.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i thought hard before writing this review because there is very little wrong with this hotel as a place to stay other than the fact that it advertises itself as a 5 * hotel and charges accordingly. i would have awarded an average other than it does not claim to be an average place. | booking | the prices are quoted ex vat and you are only given the total price at time of payment ( is not that illegal - ryanair, easyjet etc.) at no time during the booking is breakfast mentioned: for the price one would assume that breakfast would be included - not so! 100 deposit taken on check in - why? | facilities | one of the reasons for booking was that it advertised it had a spa. two steam rooms (one male and one female) is not a spa. other deficiencies in the room were annoying rather than problematic. | bars | following our theatre visit we thought we might have a quite drink before retiring for the night. as our room was on the same floor as the rumpus room we thought we might pop in however the place consisted of very noisy music played to very noisy people. | to sum up this place is nothing special - we could have had an equally good experience at a premier inn at half the price. as the title of my review suggests this place is definitely a triumph of style over substance.'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''my boyfriend and i stayed in this hotel for the night as it was 5 miles from the o2, the first impressions of the room and bathroom were quite nice however when i went to have a shower the water was coming out freezing and there was a smell of what can only be described as a dirty fish tank / sewage smell coming from the shower. | the shower also was not draining either, my boyfriend went to reception to complain, a man who could hardly speak english came up to the room to unblock the shower which made the smell even worse and the dirt, hair and other deposits that came out of the shower plug were disgusting, when we advised him of the nasty smell coming out the shower his answer was to bring us a bottle of nasty smelling air freshener, he also persisted to say that the water was warm when it clearly was not, we also had to ask him for the tv remote which for some strange reason was at reception he seemed very reluctant for us to have it. the attitude from him was that he did not care either. it so gross i ended up washing my hair in the sink and could not even close the toilet door to use the loo as the smell was so bad. | we could hear noise from the other rooms as well, people walking up the corridors and moving about upstairs, we had to keep the toilet door shut all night to make sure that fish tank smell did not come in the room, it was a very lucky thing that we actually missed breakfast the next morning as i cannot imagine what that would have been like. | again went to wash my hair in the sink the next morning as the thought of even touching that shower made me feel sick the water again was freezing, | we could not check out quicker and def would not be coming back. if you are thinking of staying in a hotel down this road please make sure you do not stay at this one.'''",0
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''let me start with the positives - the staff are so lovely and friendly, especially the gentlemen that work as concierge. the location is good. | the rooms are small and our room stank of cat wee....and there were not even cats to cuddle. our room was also a bit dirty and shabby looking, disappointing as xenia has a great trip advisor rating and reviews. | we ordered breakfast in our room and it was also underwhelming. | the bar area is over crowded with furniture. | not a very creative review but honest and to the point. | would i go back? no. maybe i will try the marriott across the road or the mercure if i am staying in that area again.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''if you had a choice, please, do not even think of staying at the savoy. i think it is a hotel for people who do not know better. well, i was one, for sure. | i am originally from asia, but have lived in the states for decades now. for christmas, my wife and i decided to go to london but could not get a room at mandarin oriental. so we got a room at the savoy for 2 nights till mandarin oriental became available. we had heard of savoy but never stayed there, so we were excited. --big mistake. we should have just delayed our trip and never stayed at the savoy. | we booked a deluxe room with a king size bed, which turned out to be a dump. | here are problems we had at the savoy: | -scornful welcome upon checking in. their comment: ""you travelled all the way from asia just to stay with us?"" upon our telling them we live in the states, ""oh, american... well, you will enjoy our culture here."" all the comments were so scornful and totally uncalled for. | -stained, really dirty carpet in our room | -stained (brownish spots) bedspread | -frayed sheets | -squeaky bed | -towel hanger barely hanging off the bathroom wall | -basin that took 1 hour to drain fully | -constant change of scorching and cold water when showering | -closet door's hinge broken, later it fell apart | -greasy doorknobs | -mice -the savoy has mice problems, especially in the kitchen (i found this out after contacting a travel agency later.) no wonder my asthmatic wife kept coughing and wheezing so badly. | -security issues -someone had gone through our personal stuff (luckily for us, we had put our rolex, cartier, all the jewelry pieces, cash and passports in the safe the night before.) and jammed my wife's empty party purse under the bed's leg. hotel claimed that she was just being forgetful! (who would place a purse under bed's leg and forget about it?) we checked out immediately, cancelling the rest of our stay. we have not seen the refund for the cancelled stay till this day. (we had paid for the room in full via expedia, but the savoy said they would 'personally guarantee to refund a one night's stay in the name of savoy' but has not done so. we are currently disputing via amex.) | so, please, do not even consider staying at the savoy. this hotel is a has-been. in our grandparents' age, it was a really good hotel. my grandparents had a really fantastic 2-week stay there decades ago. now it is a total touristy place for people from that period and tourists who have heard of its glorious past, unaware of what it is now. | if you are still going to stay at the savoy, please be sure to put your stuff in the safe. that way, you have some protection. also, upon being led to a dirty (they may claim the room is just historical, such as our case) room, please ask for another room. if you are asthmatic, do not stay at the savoy. my wife's asthma attacks completely stopped upon checking out. | enjoy your trip to london!'''",0

The Savoy,"'''we had a booking for afternoon tea in the thames foyer yesterday afternoon which we were very much looking forward to. immediately prior to this, we had watched the lion king at the lyceum across the road. it was 27 degrees celsius when we left the theatre. 25 minutes early for our afternoon tea, we assumed it would be no problem to have a drink at the bar before our table was ready. it was a bank hol sunday, so we knew not to go directly to the thames foyer and headed instead to the very quiet american bar. three very elegantly presented hostesses politely greeted us at the entrance, but informed us that our 12 year old daughters were not permitted into this area (5:20pm). completely accept this rule, but the issue was there was no alternative recommended space for us to sit and have a drink. we were told to leave the hotel altogether and find a separate place where children are accepted. it was 27 degrees outside, a bank holiday and everywhere outside on the strand was packed. even if we had located a suitable place, we only had 25 mins! the vast, vast lounge area was deserted at the savoy and i am confused as to why the multiple staff present at that time did not at the very least suggest to bring water (which we would have happily paid for) for my two daughters who were almost suffering from dehydration. its amazing that the london underground had signs up yesterday advising passengers to keep hydrated due to the heat, yet a supposedly 5* hotel cannot even adequately cater to its guests. needless to say, despite looking forward to our afternoon tea booking for quite some time, we chose to return to our own hotel (the landmark at marylebone) and patronise the people who really do understand how to provide a truly 5* experience. note to savoy: stop assuming every paying customer is a tourist arriving to take photographs. your doormen stand and chat, your hostesses stand and chat and your reception staff do not look up from their computers. i witnessed multiple tourists taking photos in your lobby and using your amenities. i can only assume your paying guests are paying a supplement to provide for these free loaders. i realise its nothing to you, but 4 x royal afternoon teas, plus champagne; you lost out on 400+. i would rather burn the cash than spend it with you.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''i and a colleague was hosted last tuesday 19 april by a guest for breakfast. the breakfast room is a delight - we had a lovely table by the window. the staff are attentive but the service can be rather chaotic: we waited 20 minutes for one of our coffees to be served and ten minutes for another. we make a mistake of ordering poached eggs with our kippers and some yogurt - the charges levied for the extras were eye-watering - the bill came to over 120 in total for 3 people for quite a modest breakfast. we were also distracted by one of the staff dropping a tray of wine-glasses - it was not the noise that disturbed us but the fact she started to pick up the jagged shards with her bare hands! we were worried for her safety. eventually another colleague brought a dustpan - but no protective gloves we could see. all restaurants have accidents - there should be procedures in place. i do not want to criticize the staff were kind and treated us well. this is a management issue; better training and better procedures. we also think the management should consider their pricing policy for small items.''',0

The Savoy,"'''shocking! staff at this hotel are like robots with no feelings. a very cold atmosphere. staff do not get the message when they are continually invading your personal space. and continually calling me ""sir"" was annoying and patronising! my wife felt exactly the same. we just want to stay in a clean place, with little interference from staff and staff who are helpful when required, not the robots at the savoy who constantly run around and annoy you with their ridiculous pleasantries! if i want to be talked to like a supreme being i will ask for it, not have it imposed on me by staff with no personalities. the savoy is an ideal hotel for pompous individuals with a huge case of insecurity. it is not for normal people who want to enjoy london and have a good night's sleep!'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''i have stayed at this hotel three times over the past two years. the last visit was in early spring 2013 and it will definitely be the last time that i will stay there ......very disappointing. | the good - fantastic location, across from victoria and albert museum, a block from the science museum, 15 minute walk to kensington park and palace, great restaurants, tube is 5 minutes walk. the buffet breakfast is outstanding. | the bad - the front desk service is mediocre at best, same goes for other services. they have this thing where you have to pay at the front desk twice during a visit .....once when you hit 1000 pounds and then when you check out. | the ugly - our room was hot beyond belief even though it was early spring and very cold outside. we felt like we were captive in a torture chamber with no escape. we had the windows open all the time (no screens) even at the risk of bats, air conditioning turned on full and it was still sweltering and stuffy. the only relief that i could get was if i lay on the floor in front of the door. a little bit of fresh air would seep under the closed door and give some relief. never so happy to leave a place. read later on trip advisor that this a common problem but the manager expressed surprise that i had this problem. | worst hotel experience that i have ever had and we travel a lot....not what we expected for the price that we paid. | the previous two visits we did not have the heat problem but subsequently understood that it is a matter of room location (the old versus the new). | i complained three times. the last time the manager came. he offered to move rooms and i stupidly declined as we only had two days left and i did not want the hassle of packing up and maybe facing the same problem in another room. in compensation, he offered me a fruit basket......a banana, two apples and an orange (which i could get from the buffet in the morning). no rate reduction offers or refunds offered.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''i had a terrible experience during afternoon tea at the dorchester. as reflected in other reviews the service was the slowest i have ever encountered- as someone else mentioned the staff quickly moved their focus to other tables. we were there for 2 and a half hours before the cakes arrived and when they did the waitress could not even recall what they were. our tea by then was stone cold and not an offer of a refill came our way. a glass of champagne was pushed over into my lap, onto my belongings. barely a sorry left the young girls mouth. please, please if you have any sense take your money elsewhere. i have since heard great things about claridges.'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''the stay was not as pleasant as those great reviews led me to believe. let me begin with the positive aspects. | as most other reviews will say, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. they asked us several times if we needed any help getting to where we wanted to go. the breakfast included with the stay was quite filling. the hotel wifi was strong, something i was very grateful for. the hotel location is fantastic for those needing to travel around central london, and there are both underground stations as well as a railway station within walking distance. | | now for the negative. there was a lot of noise from gower street, as we had a room at the front. this was not too much of issue as the windows were made to keep out street noise. other aspects were far more annoying. | first of all, the floor of our room was at an angle; a pillow had been placed under the bedding on the lower side, perhaps in an attempt to make the problem less uncomfortable. secondly, there about an inch and a half gap between the bottom of our room door and the floor; we could hear it every time others in the house left their rooms or went to use the hallway bathrooms. there are obviously also privacy issues with such a large gap. finally, the walls were ridiculously thin. to give you an idea, when those in the room next door had their television turned on at the same time we did, we often could not hear our own over theirs. i was forced to pull my bed to the other side of the room one night when it was running late into the night; it sounded as though it was right in the room. | with all the great reviews for this hotel, i am somewhat confused. it may be that one section is worse than the others; i was placed in the right side of the hotel on the ground floor. as my stay was however, i do not think i will be staying here again.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''myself and my manager arrived at this hotel and was horrifed from the first moment we saw it. i was hoping to god there was a mistake and we had arrived at the wrong hotel. we parked up the car and went inside to find we were greeted by a young man. he checked us both in. he had pointed out where my manager's room was but took me outside the building next door to what can only be described as a council house/flat. he opened the door to thr house/flat and then inserted a key into a shared access door. behind the door were 4 bedroom doors and a communal bathroom. he gave me the key to my door where i found a bed a shower a tele and a very large spider. my natural reaction was to sit on my bed and think 'is this a joke'. myself and my manager spent approx an hour ringing round hotels near by and were willing to spend 180 on a room for 1 night, this was not an option as all hotels nearby seemed to have been fully booked. i informed the receptionist that i was not happy staying in the room as i knew 3 men were staying next door to me and could easily get into my room. the receptionist kindly put me into another room in the same building as my manager. again this was awful. the sheets were dirty, the bathroom was dirty. down the side of the bed i was horrified to find newspapers,labels,sweets,wrappers. i slept with my light on all night and had around 4 hours sleep. in the morning i bravely attempted to use the kettle. i washed the kettle round with water and poured out to find the kettle and made the water go brown!!!. i would not wish for my worst enemy to stay here!!'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''awful, disgusting laundry service! i gave a brand new dress just from the shop to be pressed, they returned it with the signs of iron and told me, that they were there! | we did not tell manager or someone else at the moment but now in the loundry i am told that the dress is spoiled with iron!!!'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i was excited to stay at the ridgemount hotel based on the reviews on here - and was prepared to deal with the deficiencies such as a small room. for the price, my wife and i looked at this as budget accommodations, | we were put in a room facing the street on the top floor - and then proceeded to spend 6 nights not sleeping. after walking up 59 steps to our room, we then sweat in bed hoping against hope that the room might cool down. | despite the daytime temperature never topping 65 outside, and us leaving the window open all day while we were out, the room itself never dropped below 75. it was sweltering. | to make matters worse, at night we had to close the window because the noise outside was unbearable. now, i know about noisy streets - i grew up in new york city. but this was a whole new level of noisy. between the cars, the ambulances (there is a hospital down the street) and the drunk college kids - it was impossible to get rest. | i asked the front desk for a fan, and was told they had none. i cannot even imagine what it is like there in august! | next time i will pay more for better accommodations.'''",0
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i have always been impressed by the autograph collection hotels so was looking forward to staying at this property. it is within walking distance of the chelsea flower show, so this made it a perfect location for this trip. | the staff were pleasant, breakfast was generous and good but the rooms! so small, you had to walk sideways to get by the bed and the bathroom was insanely claustrophobic. | i understand that space is at a premium in downtown london, however other properties within the marriott brand seem to be able to deliver decent size rooms. this was not a pleasurable stay.'''",0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''terrible service across the whole hotel. receptionist not welcoming or smiling. did not mentioned breakfast, internet rate etc very poor. | breakfast was the worst we ever had in london -if you are paying so much for the room you would expect delicious breakfast - no fresh vegetables or salad 3 types of meat to choose from. when i have asked about fresh tomatoes or salad i have been told that they only serve what is in the room as its a buffet breakfast over saturday and sunday. the writer did not even try to see if they can do sth about it. if i would score it from 0 to 10- this place would get 0!!!! | we waited at least 10 minutes for somebody to ask us about coffee. | no climate -we came in december and there were no single decoration at all-if you want to came and do christmas shopping and feel christmassy mood avoid this hotel at any time. we went last year to savoy and that was a blast. we have been escorted to our room explained everything etc | the tree in the foye was breath taking unlike mondrian london'''",0

Rhodes Hotel,"'''i booked a triple room for myself, my sister and our niece. | on arrival the lady on reception showed surprise that we were british - maybe my look of shock that i was asked for my passport as id after saying hello and passing over a piece of paper with my reservation details on it, had something to do with the 'oh are you british"" she said to me. | the triple room was a double bed and a single, luckily it was not a problem for us, but it could have been as we were expecting 3 beds for what we were paying! on the plus side, the room was clean, although without much storeage space. | as for the bathroom, again it was clean, and there was enough towels, but.....the room was the width of the shower tray (shower head at one height - very high!), with about 2ft between that and the toilet. in that space was a small sink - trendy oval shape (abouth 10 x 8 inches) just off of the wall, with a 2 inch wide mirrored cabinet about 12 inches above that - certainly made cleaning your teeth interestingly difficult, and to top it all the toilet roll was under a metal cover under the sink....use the sink toilet roll keeps dry if you do not splash too much! no room for changing, so you cannot be shy when getting dressed. certainly not a helpful bathroom if you are a larger person. | oh and every day they go in a straighten your beds, tidy up towels - so using the same towel through out your stay is not an option, you do not get clean ones every day either - one of the small ones disappeared after the 1st morning, and they keep turning the air conditioning on even if you leave it off. | then we move on to the breakfast...for some reason we did not get treated the same as the other guests visiting from abroad, i know it sounds petty, but it was a continental breakfast, there was 3 of us, the 1st day we had 3 half bagels and toast. the 2nd 2 half bagel and a crumpet (we noticed others got enough if not more of each for the number in their group) and toast, service was also different because the owner we assume he was was in. the 3rd morning 2 half bagels, 2 crumpets and toast - 1 slice of which was mouldy on the edges. the one thing that made us so pleased that we was leaving that morning was seeing one of the staff take the scoops out of the 3 cereal tubs, tap them on the sides of the tubs and put them straight into a draw without washing them. | oh and the room was on the lower floor between the stairs and the room where we had breakfast, it was noisy. | on leaving we was not given any impression that we would be welcome there again. | if you are not british, i am sure you will find it better than we did, if you are british give the place a very very wide berth!!! | this place was chosen because of it is location, our niece love's the parks and gardens of london, also we wanted to visit london zoo (well worth a visit by the way - we ran out of time and only saw 2/3rds of it because we had to be elsewhere), so somewhere near hyde park and regents park was perfect.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''hotel was amazing, but i give them a low score because of one main issue. the hotel held on to $2,000 dollars from our credit card for up to 14 days. wtf.. we are traveling and needed our funds! we called to see what they could do and they said"" oh yeah"" we were never told this ever at any time! on this issue alone we will never stay with this group again. this turned a good experience into a horrible one.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i stayed for two nights over the weekend at the mo hyde park in knightsbridge, and thought i would give my thoughts. | i booked a suite, the rate for a junior suite was 395 plus tax and service. this compared very favourably with the best available rate elsewhere which was over 500 per night, room-only. | i arrived by taxi around 6pm on friday. the bellman immediately opened the taxi door, welcomed me to the hotel and collected my bags. by the time i would paid the driver, he had already written out my baggage claim. | the reception desk at the hotel is quite small, and both positions were occupied when i arrived. as soon as i arrived, another member of staff appeared and checked me. | the lobby is decorated with a lot of marble, with a number of oriental accents (such as the golden buddah figures, the use of jade colours and the flowers) - quite classy. | check-in was quick, and i was then escorted to my room (on the 2nd floor, facing knightsbridge - i believe the hyde park view rooms are significantly more expensive) by a guest services agent. unfortunately, there was some problem with the room key, so the agent opened the room with her master key. after a brief tour of the room, and asking me whether i would like a welcome tea or coffee, she returned to reception promising new keys straight away. | my bags arrived within a few minutes, followed by my tea (complimentary and served with biscuits), and then a new set of keys - along with an huge apology. | as usual, 'junior suite' is really a misnomer: these are simply larger-than-average rooms with a sitting area. | the fittings were of high quality. in particular, the seating area was spacious with two armchairs and a sofa; and there was plenty of hanging space for clothes. | the bathroom was quite long and thin, and decorated with dark green, white and black marble. the bath, toilet, bidet and twin sinks were all along one wall - the room was at least twice to three times as long as it was wide. | jo malone toiletries were supplied; shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion - in the signature lime, basil and mandarin scent, and these seem to be replenished daily. | a note on housekeeping: i asked for and received a 4pm checkout - and i was pleased to see that my room was made up on the morning of my checkout. complimentary shoe shine is available. | breakfast was served in my suite. it included coffee, orange juice, a round of toast, croissants, danish pastries and muffins and the cooked selection containing; bacon, baked beans, sausage, mushrooms and two fluffy poached eggs). certainly more than i could eat (although this may also be partially attributable to my somewhat fragile state after drinks in soho until the early hours, and all of excellent quality. | i arrange to meet a friend in the mandarin bar at 7.30pm on saturday night to have a drink before a few drinks in soho, in the end, we did not stay because the place was absolutely packed - it is clearly a very popular destination: i do not know when they will reserve tables for hotel guests??? | service is attentive but not over the top. | service was generally excellent (one minor slip: i called down to request some toothpaste - i would forgotten mine - at 9am, and it did not arrive until the afternoon), and the rooms and furnishings up to scratch. | checkout was efficient but i had to carry my bags down to reception as the member of staff promises to escort them down did not turn up after contacting reception twice.'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''after reading rave reviews of this place on tripadvisor and in the lonely planet, i booked my 5 night stay here. what can i say, it was fine for london, but if this hotel had been in any other city in the world i would have demanded my money back. london hotelery is a sad state of affairs for the consumer who has to accept that 50 pounds a night is a ""good"" price for a double room not really even big enough to be a single room (my travelling partner and i had to take turns standing in the corner so the other one could get out the door), shared bathrooms, blistering heat (the walls were always hot to the touch and the 35 degree temps did not help. the hotel provided a tiny tiny table fan to try and keep us cool) and a street so loud it made one feel as if one was sleeping right on the middle of a busy expressway. the only redeming qualities of this hotel were that it was quite well located in the city centre, the staff was extremely friendly - although mostly unwilling to fulfill out requests for a bigger fan and to change some of the terms of our stay, and there is free internet. so, again, apparently this is a good deal in london, but there is more to a good vacation than saving money. i would go back to this hotel, but only in the spring or autumn (to avoid the heat) and in a rear facing room.'''",0

Rhodes Hotel,"'''let us start with the good point and that was the location. it is very central, just a short walk to paddington station. also the breakfast lady was also great. | that is where the good points end. | when we arrived in the reception it was clear indication that the photos on the internet were not portraying the real thing. | after climbing four flights of stairs we reached our room. it was so small you could not swing a cat! the beds were old and so uncomfortable. the childrens beds were graffitied with bad language and offensive diagrams that aparently dated back 10 years. the room for 5 was so cramped it was just ridiculous. | the owners of the hotel, i think has confused being efficient with abrupt. the only nice exchange we had was when we were leaving. other exchanges were abrupt and to the point. on arrival we were not greeted, rather a lady announced 'arrivals at the door' to reception person then walked past us. also the reception area was untidy and not knowledgable, on the two occasion when we asked for advice the response was just 'i do not know'. | i struggle to understand how this establishment won an award.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''staying at the savoy is meant to be a treat. this trip was more of a bind that a treat. | the hotel is resplendant in its newly refurbished 'coat' but every effort made here is thoroughly undermined by the arrogant and rude attitude of the staff. not all of them though i am sure. | we had a little walk around the hotel on saturday to decide what we would do whilst staying over the weekend. | walking into the american bar we were about 15 feet away from the room when the 'waitress' saw us and thew up her hand (flat towards my face) and shouted 'stop, i will be with you in a minute'. i do not think so! when i told he we were residents she swiftly changed her tune. | the same in the river restaurant. we were looking where sunday breakfast was to be and were stopped at the door by a stern faced woman who said 'you cannot have a loo, there are plates being carried around you might have an accident'. feeble excuse at best. again, reminding the woman of our residents status she swiftly changed her tune. | there are lots of people in the lobby of the savoy taking pcitures most days so if it is they that the staff wish to stop then they should rather than be rude to everyone. | the food is great, the rooms very high standard but without a decent tv package or internet (9.95 per day). do not fall for the historic charm, as sweet as it is because anyone who has eyes and ears will end up being upset by the rude, intrusive and often aggressive attitudes of the staff, sadly. | i will say though that the head doorman tony cortegaca is polite, warm, friendly and genuinely the only one that made us feel welcome.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we have stayed in various mandarins throughout the world and this has got to be the worst. though an impressive looking building from the outside and impressive foyer and bar the rooms are so poor we asked to see others as the room was so poor we we are ready to walk out and book into the barclay opposite. carpets were stained and rucked up, the bathroom had seen better days as the bath looked as if it had been re enameld many times over. there were cracks across the ceilings. the smoke detector looked as if it had not been changed after the last fire and no matter how hard you slammed the door it would not actually shut. we waited for the duty manager who at the time was getting a loud grilling from an unhappy loud american woman, could not blame her as her problems were similar. we would not stay here again as very poor value for money and rooms did smell odd bit like a damp antique shop.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''six months ago, we picked the savoy over other hotels because of a 3 night/get one free deal. we booked 2 suites, with a confirmation that had a cancellation fee and noted ""best available rate."" because they do not check you in, they and we did not confirm the deal at the start of our stay. at the end of our stay, the hotel claimed that because we did not confirm the stay 3/get one free in their language, they refused to give us the deal. they admitted the deal was offered when we booked, but claimed that we needed the right confirmation language, so no credit, no free night, despite spending a fortune at the hotel. the manager argued with me, which was really deploring. add to this, the third night, the roof flooded - a down pour - on to our bed, and we had to move all of our belongings to other rooms that were much less accommodating - no closet, old furniture, small bathroom with one sink. we did not complain because we expected the one night free. even upon raising this issue, the savoy would not budge and give us the deal available when we booked. the ritz would never have treated a customer this way. do not stay here.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we recently stayed at the savoy for a birthday surprise and our first impressions started well by far exceeding our already high expectations. arriving at this very beautiful, grand hotel, that is steeped in history will make the most stone hearted individuals smile.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''first of all let me say location is pretty good, rooms are quite nicely decorated and reasonably spacious (apart from the daft wall mural in our second room which would have been a much better position for the tv). however, service leaves a lot to be desired, the porters are excellent, friendly and proactive and should be applauded. check-in was unusual, we arrived early and were told our room was not ready, but we were to be put on priority list for a room, which is fine, we knew we were a couple of hours early, so no big deal, we would leave our bags and get a drink or something (we had 50 hotel credit to use with our room rate). but were told we should come back after 3.00pm!??! how is that anything to do with a priority list to get our room ready? just say it will not be ready until official check-in time, pointless. so we skipped the drinks (as we had no room number to charge them to) and headed into town, a little bemused, but no problem. came back about 6ish grabbed our bags, nice enough room, views out to city side not too bad from 10th floor. tried to call down for some ice, but could not get phone to work, had to use my mobile phone to call the hotel, got the ice. my wife decided to take a shower and the drains were severely blocked flooded the bathroom, she had just soaped her hair so had to rinse and the water was coming out into the room, all her clothes on the floor in the bathroom soaked. called through to reception (with my mobile phone again) to ask manager to come up as we would need to change room. they did come reasonably promptly with a maintanence guy who unblocked the drain and started looking at the phone, but kept asking if we needed to change room. i had to explain to him that yes, the bathroom is flooded with nowhere for the water to go of course we need to change room. the manager although not rude in any way was very underwhelming, no real apology, left us with a key to a lower floor, inferior courtyard facing room which although was larger (but very bare) and probably a higher grade of room was not as nice as our first room and you could hear revelers coming and going regularly through the evening/night as it was the closest room t the lifts. after the problems we had with our first room, common sense tells you to wow your customer with a nicer room that will most definitely have no issues, in fact i would have been happy with the same grade of room that did not look out over the three other outside walls of the hotel and was in a quieter position. we decided not to go down to the bar for a drink, as my wife's clothes for the evening had become wet and unwearable anyway and took a couple of drinks from the minibar (expensive, but impressive) instead to use up our 50 hotel credit. we have since been invoiced for the drinks we had and i am waiting for the hotel to come back to me about refunding my credit my card (which had better happen). i would have given the hotel 4 stars if not for the way my problems were dealt with, i understand things go wrong, but if they do, i expect to be wowed by the way problems are dealt with, in this instance i was very underwhelmed and it did put a bit of a damper on the evening and the incorrect billing is disappointing as well, the hotel really did not acknowledge or really apologise for what went wrong and were very matter of fact about it, very disappointing stay for the price we paid. not sure if we would be prepared to give them another chance when there are so many better priced more service orientated options in london.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''the hotel was in a great location as we were visiting the royal albert hall but i would not agree that their ""superior"" bedrooms were in any way ""superior"". they were unfortunately the smallest double rooms i have stayed in in london. there was about 1-2ft of space around the double bed which for two guests was impractical. we did not want to spend any time in the room at all. although the rooms are stated as ""newly refurbished"" there were many dated features. the bathroom was tiny. i would say this hotel is a 3* and not a 4*. there is also an additional charge for use of the pool/spa which was unexpected when the photos of the hotel include marketing of the pool etc. when i questioned the size of the room with the main reception staff they were not at all helpful and basically said it is, what it is. i would not stay there again as i have had better experiences in a premier inn which are a great deal more comfortable.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''the hotel has a great location and the doormen were helpful with directions. the room was nicely decorated and the room service was prompt. however, i stayed 3 nights and was awoken by a loud party on two of the nights. my room was supposed to have a courtyard view, but instead it looked out on an ugly roof that was littered with cigarette butts. the room smelled of smoke. when i complained, i was not offered compensation or a new room. i felt that my concerns were dismissed. there was no follow up from the hotel. if you wish to eat in the restaurants be sure to make reservations well in advance as they are booked by visitors to the hotel room who are not staying at the hotel. perhaps they should keep a block of tables for patrons staying at the hotel.'''",0

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''while i cannot say enough good things about the staff here (and they were very accommodating), the only reason to choose this hotel is its location. it is only a few blocks from the british museum and three or four blocks to the euston station. other than that, this place is wretched. the establishment is run-down and worn; the rooms are laughably small (one member of our party had a single which was so small she could probably have turned on the water while lying in bed). although i think this pertains primarily to the en suites; my daughter just had a single and her room was huge, much bigger than our double. the beds are all a standard size, however, and there literally was not room for my husband and i to turn over--although we did a fair amount of tossing. the beds are rock-hard at the sides and saggy in the middle; the pillows were sand bags; the shower drain did not work well and so the water was up around your ankles within minutes. the breakfasts were . . . meh. pretty tasteless, although freshly cooked. | do yourself a favor and pay a bit more for a real hotel.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,'''i aranged to meet some family here for a pre dinner drink. i arrived early and was met with a fairly attractive bar but one that lacked atmosphere. after a long wait for someone to attend to my table the waiter finaly appeared. he was pleasent and very helpful - re arranging seating for my soon to arrve guests. he left the drinks menu and i was horrified at the prices. now committed to stay as guest were on the way i ordered 1 drink each for the 3 of us here already. drinks took an age to arrive but agan waiter was very friendly. guests turned up after about 15 mins and i ordered another 3 drinks and a bottle of water. the waiter poured two of the new drinks and the ammounts in each glass were a little short as he was trying to get them both out of a bottle that was already nearly empty. we let this go as we were now pushng tme to leave to make another appointment. i went to the bar to pay the bill as could not stand to wait any longer for service. i paid a horrendous bill of 96 for 7 drinks - one of them was just a glass of coke. so roughly 14 each. at this point just needed to get out - so paid in full with a tip and started to leave. as got to the hotel doors a waiter chased us down and accused us of leaving without paying the bil. i explaned that i had and showed him the reciept. we tried to leave agan and he came back sayng there was a mistake and there were 2 bills we needed to pay - and produced a second bill for items we had not had. i sent my guests on and went back to the bar to put an end to this embarasng nonesense. i will never go back to this hotel and will advise everyone i know to stay away.''',0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i have a lot of negative things to say about this restaurant so i will start with compliments: it has a good location in the city, though not exactly close to an underground/tube station as they are all about a 12 minute walk away, but it is about 3 stops and/or a transfer on the tube from most of the great tourist sights in london. the hotel is also very close to the british museum, about 7 minutes away. the bed itself was ok and the pillows were comfortable. | we are in london. i get it. but this hotel is objectively bad for the price. i will start with the rooms. if you spread your arms, you can almost touch both walls. the street is very loud and the window is old and paper thin. plus you will end up opening the window because the room is blazing hot even if the weather is not that cold. there is no bathroom in the room, only a sink. the sink in my room gave off a pungent sewage smell every time water was used and went down the drain not a good look (or smell!). they also replace your towels even if you hang them up, so if you are all about the environment or saving water that is one thing to know, or you should address it upon arrival and hope that they do not replace your towel every. single. day. | moving on from the rooms (because the rooms do not have showers!). the bathrooms. they are all shared with the entire hotel. oh boy. there are three, maybe four showers. there is also a bathtub. yes, a bathtub shared between all the guests in a hotel. i get it, the building is ancient, but this sort of accommodation belongs in a hostel, not a hotel. you might have to wait to take a shower depending on the time in the morning. also, the shared bathrooms with toilets have cloth towels to dry your hands. if you like a 'family run, mom and pop hotel', this is the place for you, but a towel used by other hotel guests you do not know to dry your hands is a little gross. those hand towels belong in your families home, not in the family hotel for all the guests to use. | next is the breakfast. they must be trying to compensate for the poor lodging by offering a full-service breakfast. you sit down and are asked if you want cereal, then coffee, tea, or hot chocolate, the main dish (usually an egg with ham, beans, or sausage), and toast. the breakfast is good, but as someone who frequents plenty of hotels, for me the breakfast is an integral part of a lodging experience. i prefer to go get my toast, eggs, or whatever i am having on my own and without a server's assistance. the breakfast turns bad when you realize that they want to turnover your table as quickly as possible, or take your dishes so they can clean them. on several occasions i had finished eating my eggs and the server would come to clear dishes and insist i move my toast to the smaller plate in order to clear my larger plate. i perceive this as a little rude as it is more or less telling me how to enjoy my breakfast, and because it shows little regard for the customer. maybe it is because i am not english, but the fact that they are forcing a particular dining style on you is not a positive approach. | there is no luggage room. this is not necessarily a problem, but you put your luggage in the common lobby area where anyone else could access it as long as they are buzzed into the building or have a key. sure there are cameras, but nonetheless it is rather unsettling to leave your luggage there for the day. | if there is another place in this price range with a similar location or distance from the city centre, then choose it over this hotel. london is an expensive city, but this hotel is not a great value for this cost if you are looking for comfort.'''",0
The Lanesborough,"'''as a local i used to frequent the lanesborough often, for breakfast, drinks or dinner. in fact, it was one of my favourite destinations. | i had not been since it has reopened and arranged a celebration drinks and dinner with friends. | sadly we walked through to the garden bar for an aperitif but were turned away - apparently you can only have a drink if you are smoking a cigar. ridiculous. when you are hosting people and this is your first interaction, i was of course shocked since i had escorted my guests through and was telling them what a lovely little bar it was. i have had drinks many a time in this courtyard so was quite surprised and embarrassed to be turned away. | we then went through to the library bar for a drink and the cocktails were beautiful. however, one latecomer joined us and he arrived at the table with a look of horror. he is ghanaian and was stopped in an unnecessary and unwelcoming manner at the entrance of the hotel by a gentleman wanting to know what he was doing. my friend was really quite upset that just because he was black he was stopped, unlike any of us or the guests who entered ahead of him. every other one of my guests was welcomed so we were all disgusted as you can imagine. | very sadly this attitude really spoilt what should have been a celebration. i ended up spending a vast sum of money for a dinner that had an uncomfortable undertone throughout. the lanesborough needs to take a step back and reflect on this disgraceful example of discrimination. i was enormously embarrassed at this but unfortunately there was little i could do. it was a shame because the quality of food and drink was excellent but quite frankly this is totally and utterly unacceptable.'''",0

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''when we entered the newly opened corinthia hotel it looked quite appealing. checked in by a very pleasant receptionist who showed us around the hotel and then to our room. the restaurants and lounge areas looked good but the lounge area seemed very ""choked"" with people. it took a long time to reach our room and, to be honest, if i had been staying there alone i would have got lost through the mazes we had to encounter before reaching one of the smallest bedrooms i have every stayed in......this room was a suite!! the problem was they had divided the space so that a large area was taken up by an entrance hallway and a walk in closet, so not much left in the footage for the bedroom - nothing like the spacious room i had viewed on line when booking!! i was given a pretty hard sell on the spa but we were shopping that afternoon, planned an early dinner (the concierge booked our table for &amp;pm in the hotel's italian restaurant) and as we were up at 4am for a flight - time did not allow for spas. when we arrived at the restaurant there was a huge fuss between the staff (2 young girls who were flustered and did not know what to do!) nobody could find our booking although we were actually present in the restaurant earlier that afternoon when the table was being booked!! it took about 5 minutes to seat us despite the restaurant only being about 20% full!! we were not offered drinks but left seated for another 15 minutes until eventually a young girl came and asked if we would all like a glass of prosecco, she seemed very bemused when i replied ""no thank you"", so she just turned and walked away - very odd!! we felt left and forgotten by a group of very inexperienced and incompetent staff!! i had to physically go and get somebody to ask us for drinks and to take our order as we had booked an early table for a reason - an early flight the next day! the waiter was totally ""in our faces"", kept interrupting our family conversation with nothing in particualr and he was there inappropriately throughout the whole of the meal - one extreme to another. we were brought the wrong meals and when the right food eventually turned up my daughter needed the bathroom, this was such a long distance away from the restaurant that i had to ask them to remove her meal and keep it warm until she returned!! it prevented me from going to the bathroom too!! the bed was like a rock so i had no sleep but a stiff neck! also, the bathroom window was totally clear glass and overlooked by the buildings opposite - really bad design to not have opaque glass. as we showered as soon as we arrived at the hotel in the afternoon it was only luck that i noticed this faulty design and drew down the blind! the hotel was very lacking in lots of areas i would expect to be perfect for a 5 star. the location of the bedrooms seemed like a rabbit warren and i felt immediately this was a fire hazard! the hotel is too big and impersonal for our liking. the staff in the italian restaurant require an awful lot of training and attention to detail. we know to avoid the corinthia in london and would not recommend this hotel!!'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''myself and my partner stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. whilst the stay was pleasant enough, when we returned home we discovered we had left some property in the room. whilst this property was not valuable it did hold significant sentimental value. i contacted the hotel the next day and was told to email details of the property (which gave me the impression that staff did not want to deal with me over the phone). i then had to email again few days later as i had not yet received a response. after more waiting i finally received a reply telling me that the housekeeping staff had thrown this property away! to add insult to injury i was told that had i ""informed us about this the same day you checked out, we could have traced these for you"". our bags had been left in the lobby of the hotel until 7pm the evening we left london, it would have been very simple for the staff to trace and return our property to us the same day, but took the lazy option and just threw it out. i have since been told this is because the staff ""assumed"" it was rubbish. | this whole experience has caused a lot of distress and i have found the concern and attitude of the staff far from satisfactory.'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''booked a weekend at the dorchester for a weekend to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and my sixtieth birthday, on arrival the staff appeared to be very courteous and obliging but after we had been out for a walk in the afternoon we received a telephone message to say the hotel needed to authorise our credit card, i attended reception and said it was not a problem but then i was advised i should telephone my bank and release more funds to cover the bill, it became very apparent the dorchester thought we were fraudsters and fully expected us to do a ""moonlight flit"". that evening we had booked a table at langans for dinner but the evening was completely spoiled as all we could talk about was the indignity of the dorchesters apparent appraisal of our financial circumstances, i confronted the duty manager and advised him we had more than sufficient funds to cover whatever came our way. i also advised my wife and i had stayed in some of the best hotels in the world (raffles, waldorf astoria and many top class hiltons) and had never experienced anything like the embarrassment the dorchester has inflicted on us. the duty manager offered us a champagne tea as way of compensation but we declined, we do not need ""free-bees"", we can pay our our way. | all we ask is that all guests are treated with respect and not made to feel insignificant because the do not turn up in a rolls royce or wear armani suits. | it looks suspiciously like the hotel runs a ""postcode"" appraisal of guests, obviously ours (sheffield) was on their risky list and they wanted to make sure we did not leave without paying. what was supposed to be a celebratory weekend turned in to a nightmare and one we will remember for a long time to come and no, we will not be going back to the dorchester, even if was free.'''",0

"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''i have booked 2 rooms from 10 ~ 13 july 2018, when arrived i was shocked how tiny the hotel is, very small lobby probably 15 m by 4 m no space to sit. but this not all the air conditioning was terrible imagine you pay for a 5 star boutique hotel with bad air conditioning and what made things worse is the high temperatures in london so there was no way of opening the window to get cool air. after changing rooms and still poor air conditioning they suggest bringing a fan to the room, i personally have never ever stayed in a 5 star hotel with a fan in my room. if you want to relax and have a drink there is two choices the cigar bar which has 2 section one with a tv but the smell is unbearable in both even with open air. elevators take for ever, outdated small so taking the stairs is a better choice. rooms are small for the price paid unless you go for a suite. staff where excellent from the hotel doorman to the reception to room service i have to be fare, they were trying the best but it is not in their hand, it seems the owners invested in the furniture renovation and kept the air conditioning to a later that what i understood from one of the employees which is big mistake specially with rising temperatures in london and europe in general'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''they have taken what was the most beautiful, comfortable hotel in london and turned it garbage, a modern interior designer's insane nightmare. that is mandarin oriental for you: they have done the same with the mark in new york, with everything they touch. do not waste the money.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''although our observations may be unique to our age related physical challenges, we thought our experience might be helpful to others. although the savoys massive renovations admirably maintained the property's unquestionable beauty, it appears less thought was given to practicality. consequently, instead of being accommodated by the hotel, we found ourselves accommodating the hotel! for example: | softness of the in-room settee results in a sitting position roughly 12 above floor level not an ideal sitting position and an extremely difficult one from which to arise for people in their 70s. | drawers within the beautiful, mirror-fronted wardrobes have shrunk and warped making it difficult to open and close them. | the in-room safe was mounted in a closet, at floor level. access requires getting on your knees and even then, the operating instructions and the safes interior are virtually invisible in the closets dark recesses; particularly so when viewed through bifocal/progressive lenses. | our bathroom did not offer a separate shower. bathing therefore required stepping over the high (+/- 30) side of the bathtub, navigating the inward sloping tub walls while balancing between the bathroom floor and elevated bottom of the tub. | bathroom storage space was limited to a narrow glass shelf above the single, pedestal sink; adequate for toothbrushes and nothing else. | the bedroom contained a dressing table alcove with three sided mirrors and a single table lamp; i.e. no overhead lighting. the electric outlet upon which the lamp depended was the same outlet required to operate the hairdryer. so, when it comes time to dry your hair you can either have light or a dryer; either way you will wind up on your knees to access the electric outlet situated beneath the dressing table. | the air conditioning had two settings: on or off. the ceiling-mounted air conditioning louvres were angled downwards, directly at our bed. to avoid sleeping in a cold draft we turned the air conditioning off and when the room became unbearably warm, we got up to turn it back on. | the bijoux elevators are beautiful, but noisy. our room was adjacent to one elevator shaft and the elevators routinely interrupted our sleep. | on arrival, we had received a charming welcoming note from the savoys managing director. unable to reach him the next morning, i wrote a note explaining my concerns about our room. i took this letter to reception for delivery to the hotels management. three days later, we received a call, apologizing for the delayed response and offering to move us to another room. | during our conversation, i pointed out that on arrival, our room was unavailable and we were directed to the american bar for a cup of tea. i expressed concern regarding my wifes difficulty in ascending the stairs, but her physical challenges did not appear to have registered with the receptionist as evidenced by the room assigned to us. this is not the care and attention i would have expected from a property like the savoy. | more general observations: | reception is staffed by young, attractive, courteous, but seemingly ill-trained individuals who appear incapable of meeting anything other than the most perfunctory requests; e.g. on arrival our room was not available, but we were promised we would be advised (via mobile) the minute it became available. three hours later, we returned to the savoy and spoke with the same person in reception. she neither recognized us nor recalled we were waiting for our room. | housekeeping appeared understaffed. at one point, after being out for the day, we returned to find our room had not been serviced. ultimately, someone arrived in the early evening hours and a minimal, less-than-5-minute fluff was duly completed by a seemingly harried and decidedly unhappy individual. | one morning we were disturbed by a fire alarm. when we could detect neither heat, smoke, nor flames, we phoned the front desk only to learn this was the weekly test of the fire alarm system! that evening, a notice on our tv alerted us (8 hours after the fact) to the scheduled alarm!! | we are huge fairmont fans and had looked forward to staying at the savoy. sadly, this is the first time we have been disappointed by a fairmont property.'''",0

The Rembrandt,'''we had booked a carvery lunch for 18 people preceding a visit to the v &amp; a exhibition. they knew when they took the booking that there would be this number of people. when we arrived the restaurant was almost empty but they took ages to take orders for wine and the so called supervisor proceeded to give one member of waiting staff [although there were several people standing around doing nothing] the job of bringing individual glasses. this took so long our meal was finished so we cancelled our order. given the location of this hotel one would have thought they would be far more organised. very disappointing.''',0
The Savoy,"'''a disappointment, no doubt. this beautiful building located on one of the loveliest stretches of the embankment has a commercial, formulaic approach to hospitality. the savoy is the antithesis of an elegant, refined luxury hotel. it is big and confusing. the beautiful lobby feels more like a vast money-making souvenir shop than an exclusive refuge for travelers who choose to spend exceedingly high prices for remarkably ordinary rooms. the public spaces are awash in crowds. the atmosphere in the lobby rivals the foot traffic on the strand. our junior suite: an emphasis on junior. the decor may be ""expensive"" but it is unimaginative and somewhat dowdy. the highlight of our room was a spectacular view. but the trade-off is not worth it. you are viewing the thames, the embankment and all that is lovely about london. but once you walk away from the view, through the lobby and on to the exceedingly commercial strand you realize how incongruous to consider any hotel in such an environment a luxury five star hotel. this is a very expensive tourist hotel. considering all the luxurious london hotels this is a very poor choice. finally, the service does not feel at all genuine. it is, as i said, formulaic. nearly every guest has the exact same experience. the savoy management does a good job training its staff. fairmont's wheelhouse tends to be these enormous, expensive hotels that tend towards commercial (think the plaza in new york) which actually do not measure up to the other five-star hotels at this price point. | lastly, since the rooms vary tremendously, make certain you like the one you have been assigned to: our friends booked a deluxe room and ended up facing an air shaft with too few square meters to deserve the appellation ""deluxe.""'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''we stayed here when my husband did the london surrey bike ride around london. he started from the olympic park, very early in the morning, so we needed a hotel within riding distance. the hotel is about half an hour walk from the olympic park and westfield shopping centre, here you will also find the new station that runs straight into london. | we had a ground floor room overlooking the main road at the front of the hotel, which was quite noisy until you got used to the traffic noise. big old fashioned sash windows meant we could not have any fresh air as could not leave the windows open. the room was very hot and stuffy when we arrived. would hate to be there in the middle of summer. | the room was a good size though and had a tv,,hairdryer and fridge in. the en-suite looked clean enough although the shower tray did fill up when i had a shower so had to stop otherwise it would have flooded the floor of the bathroom. | there was only one pillow each we i never understand why hotels in england still do this, and the underside of the bed throw was disgusting and had not been washed. make sure you check this! i never had the breakfast because even though the hotel was full of cyclists doing the ride they would not open the kitchen early for them. i was not going to sit there on my own! the only positive point i can make is that they have there own parking and they allowed us to leave our car there all day sunday until we were ready to go home. shame because could be a nice hotel if it was cleaned up and the curtains fitted the windows. i paid 100 for 1 night, which i feel due to the distance from central london was too much. but we had no choice. if we went again to that area would try and book earlier and stay in nicer looking hotels on the opposite side of the road a bit nearer to the park.'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''i was incredibly excited to stay at the dorchester as it is a legendary hotel. i have been to london many times but i usually stay at the baglioni or the berkeley. my travel agent convinced me that the dorchester was worth a stay and that the red carpet would certainly be rolled out upon my arrival. i had arranged for my travel agent to book me a suite and was very specific that i wanted an art deco suite; nothing too country cottage style. he assured me the dorchester would deliver. i arrived at the hotel late in the evening and was escorted to my suite quickly. upon entering the room i am immediately disappointed to see that although i have been given a suite, it is completely styled in country cottage decor. i politely make my displeasure known only to get the response that i had been upgraded and that no other suites were available for that evening. this was completely unacceptable. for a hotel with such a reputation as the dorchester they should live up to their reputation and serve to satisfy their guests. i had specifically arranged not to have this type of suite. there are many luxury hotels in london that would love to have my business. why should i pay 900 gbp a night for a suite i do not want to stay in? after absolutely refusing to stay in the suite i was given i was moved to an art deco suite that was smaller, dirty, and just plain disgusting! i was shocked that they would actually put someone in that room! i have included pictures in my review to verify. there were hairs that were not mine in the bathroom sink, stains on the drapes and the carpet, chipped and broken furniture, soap scum on the shower door and worst of all the medicine cabinet doors opened up to a crawl space with exposed piping and insulation. i could not believe this was coming from a 5 star hotel. being that it was already in the am and i was exhausted, i went to sleep. the next morning i called reception to see if they had any clean suites available. i let them know how upset i was with the conditions of the suite i was in. i was told there were no suites available and that they were sorry the suite did not meet my expectations. so, i quickly made a reservation for the royal suite over at the baglioni, where paul, the concierge, (he is just fab!) was happy to greet me when i arrived. before leaving the dorchester i snapped some photos with my phone and checked out. upon checking out i complained that the room i spent the night in was horrific and that someone had bungled my reservation. i showed them the photos on my phone and was told that they usually would not put a guest in a room of that condition but since i insisted on an art deco room they had no alternative. they also reduced my rate but i still ended up paying a ridiculous amount for one night in hell.'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i am giving one star for the location and one star for the room size. and okay, the gym is decent. | but apart from those: | - what a waste of space with such old furniture and fittings! my room looks and feels like fawlty towers from the 70s. the paint on the dresser is inch-thick after decades of repainting, and the lock is about to come off! the light switches and door handles are no better. i do appreciate period furniture, but they have mistaken that with just old furniture which are simply shoddy and shabby. even the lifts are marked with scratches and dents; i felt like riding on a cargo lift in an industrial building than in a 5-star hotel. | - i checked in late at night and the curtains were closed. as morning came i opened them just to reveal, to my horror, that my window was facing a light well and mere two feet away from the window of another room! mind you, ""courtyard"" room does not give you anything that resembles a courtyard. very disappointing. | - perhaps the last straw was the breakfast. the food was so-so, but the biggest problem was when they presented me with a shot glass of the daily special juice. i do not know what it was because i did not dare to drink it, given the glass had a very clear red lipstick stain!! i showed it to a staff, who quickly took it away in embarrassment. and guess what? the same thing happened again the following morning: another lipstick stained shot glass of ""morning booster juice""! i ended up checking every single cutlery given to me, in both amazement and disgust. | really, when has mo's standards and hygiene levels dropped to such depths? i am so sorry as a hk native, that i have to write this such a damning review about my hometown brand. but this was just appalling....'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i understand that the hotel has been refurbished and so, you will expect the nicest hardware. the problem is the people. i have a couple of unpleasant situations and whilst the hotel has apologised for such tardy behaviour, in my mind, a hotel remotely near this price range is committing a cardinal sin. on top of that, if you stay in the superior room, its so small that there is no space for a 29inch bag. i would choose langham london for a welcoming feel to a spacious room and at a fraction of the price. so you be the judge.'''",0
The Rembrandt,'''we stayed here in may 2005 | rooms tiny had to climb over bed to get in - we had 2 suitcases and hardly had room to put them down anywhere. | great location though 5 minutes to harrods and also good restaurants. | the hotel lost our laundry - but eventually at 11.15pm found it in another room''',0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i stayed in many hotels around the world, but this one was without doubt the worse hotel i have stayed at. i stayed there for 3 nights, in the smallest room i have ever seen, even a hostel room would be larger. the room had a tiny window overlooking the wall of the opposite building. the furniture in room was at least 20 years old. i do not think that is worth $600 a night. the staff were snobish and some of them even rude, maybe because i am not one of the celebrities they are used to see. | the mandarin hotel in london is the worst value for money hotel. i think it got the reputation as some celebrities stay there, and that is why they are charging high rates. | and the most upseting thing is that the bar manager in hotel is homosexual and started hitting on my 15 years old son, when i asked to talk to the general manager, he apologised and offered me a glass of orange juice ( on the house). | conclusion; i will never return to this hotel even if i was offered free nights there. and i would never recomend this hotel to anyone, not even my enemies.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''booked 2 nights in the savoy for a surprise for our 26th anniversary ,unfortunately did not start well .the staff were very polite and helpful no fault there and the surrounding were beautiful .my major disappointment and what i cannot get over is the room we were given at first ,apart from being a bit dull and on the same level or worse than a budget hotel was the smell of stale smoke.then i realised we had been given a smoking room ,i did not even think you were allowed to smoke anywhere anymore ,but apparently the 9th floor is a smoking floor!! i am disgusted we were given this room ,when we certainly did not request smoking room, this ruined my stay !such a shame'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''without a doubt the worst place i have stayed in london. dirty and disgusting rooms. no kettle or tea/coffee making facilities, dirty walls next to pillows and bed, and tiny bathrooms covered in human hair. the greeting from the laughable reception was to have our keys thrown across the counter at us (which happened to be the wrong rooms) and then we were asked if we were planning to use the toilet doing our stay???? | do not bother with breakfast as it consists of bitter coffee with a slice of cold toast. | avoid this hotel at all costs.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed at the mondrian for our wedding anniversary on 7th july. over promised &amp; under delivered overall. disappointing for what is supposed to be a high touch service hotel. arrived at 1420 to checkin, a little early granted, but was told room would be ready by 330p, and we will email you. so at 4pm we rang, sorry room not ready, 430pm my wife went back to the hotel to speak to them and had to wait again. we were told originally that the room would be worth waiting for, but unfortunately other than a river room, fairly standard room. | breakfast | i have had better service in a little chef, in fact anywhere. staff were few &amp; far between, had to wait and ask 3 times for tea/coffee. had to wait 20 minutes for poached eggs. | no water refills, no coffee refills, basic stuff for a high touch hotel! | nice location, as they say fur coat &amp; no knickers!'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i was here to meet some clients but unfortunately they were having work done on the hotel, signing was not clear, main reception not helpful so was left to my own devices. | when i located a bar area i found out this was for afternoon tea but fortunately i was shown to the correct bar by a very helpful member of staff (dominic) . whilst it was nice to be welcomed to the bar area it had no ambience, a wine tasting was going on close by and the real downside was finding out the journey i had to make for the nearest bathroom (not good news either if you were disabled as this does not seem to be taken into account) | i decided to contact my client and arrange to meet elsewhere. such a pity as they were looking forward to meeting at the venue.'''",0
London Guest House,"'''my son stayed here and despite the hotel being prepaid they took the money again leaving him short of cash on his first trip to london. they refunded it but by mistake they did it twice. despite being informed that the refunds had not come through and they would have to wait until the money came back into his account they went back in without authorisation and took the money out, the day before the refunds hit his bank account. this left my son overdrawn and one of his dd came back unpaid so he also has to pay bank charges. watch this hotel look after your cash because they hang on to your bank details.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''unfortunately, despite the other wonderful reviews, my experience has not been good at all. the reservations manager was surly and extremely rude on the telephone and while the front desk staff try to be polite they are obviously in a difficult environment and do not deliver good customer service. the room is tiny (even by uk standards), the bed is dreadfully uncomfortable and the bathroom has a nauseating smell. maybe other rooms look like the ones on the website but be warned that the customer service is dreadful and at least one room is also awful.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''when you pay gbp430 a night you have high expectations. you do not expect smelly rooms because of old carpets that should have been replaced years ago, nor do you expect to see aircleaners on footworn carpets in the hallways that are turned on around the clock to keep away the smell. and once in bed after a long day of tough business meetings you immediately notice that the mattress you have beneath is of a kind that your body would expect was in use 50 years ago, but perhaps that was when it was brand new? on the more positive side the fitness room was very nice, most of the employees were very service minded and the brasserie in the basement was also a nice experience. but all in all this was a real disappointment. two days in the past at a hotel that definitely has seen its better days was enough in a city with loads of other opportunity nowadays, unless you are of the sort that like to spend much money on old time glory.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''it all started well from heathrow using their car service. i arrived on an early flight so i used the gym to freshen up after the flight and went straight to the office as my room was not ready. they were very helpful and the staff were the best anywhere i have been at that point. | when i did get back and check-in to my room it all got very disappointing. see the list below. some things are small and people might roll their eyes, others are not. but given i have stayed all over the world i know what 5 star is, and this is not it. i also know what usd 600 per night should buy and this is also not it. then again, this is the first time i have stayed in a london hotel so maybe it is a local thing. | - given they had all day, my bags were still not in my room upon return and i had to wait 10 minutes for them - no apology by the way. | - the room overall was small (definitely a london thing i have been told) and run down, peeling paint, a head board from the 60s, cracked tiles in the bathroom and just little things like pens that did not work. | - the mattress is lumpy and takes some effective positioning to avoid what felt like a rolled up towel under your back. now this was a real surprise because i have had hard/soft beds but you do not stay at place like this and expect a lumpy bed. | - the bathrobe actually had grease or some sort of dark grimy stain on it. | my general feeling is the savoy runs on past glories and lacks any real attention to detail and is in desperate need of a refurbishment. the staff are exceptional at the desk, but maybe management should take a look at their own rooms a bit. i was very glad to see it was well down the list of london hotels, it deserves to be there. i will not return and will be trying somewhere else next time.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed here from the 19/03/2016 for two nights. the location of the hotel is good right beside the river on the south bank. things that made it fall short of that 5* experience however may seem minor to others but it is not right in my opinion for such a hotel. firstly on arrival and check in we was not offered any assistance with our luggage up to the room. we did actually enter the hotel from the south bank as we used the tube and walked over blackfriars bridge so maybe this would of been different if we would of used the entrance round the other side and maybe pulled up in a taxi but in my opinion the hotel should be prepared for guests from either side. i did see other guests offered this service while i was passing through the reception at other times but from a different reception worker, which only annoys you more. the actual room was fine no complaints could be made with that we was situated on the 15th floor (top floor) in a queen room with good views and we got for a good price via voyage prive. room was clean tidy and modern. we had bed and breakfast deal and this is where we were really let down again. breakfast is hosted in the sea containers restaurant on the ground floor, as we went down to breakfast and you approach the area there is no clear greeting area so you then look to your right and can see a desk so we went over like you did and said we had come down for breakfast there was no greeting. we was then led on a lap all round the houses of the restaurant where we were eventually sat on a table that had not been cleaned, still had crumbs from the previous persons toast, was not laid (no cutlery/glasses) and then was just left with no instructions as to where the food was, what the situation was as in self serve, menus etc and we were just left until a waiter eventually came over. so after being sat for a few minutes we took it on ourselves to make our way over to the areas that had food visible and it was only at this point are designated waiter acknowledged us and offered us tea/coffee. so we then went over and gathered our food and returned to seat. the table still had not been cleaned/wiped nor laid so we then had to ask for cutlery. there is no still or sparkling water available for guests you have to ask for water which involves waiting again and only tap water is provided where as every other 5* london hotel i have stayed at before water still or sparkling is normally readily available at the breakfast counters for you to use as you wish. the actual food which is available was ok, like average and there was not a great selection, no baked beans, very limited cereals, fruit, pastries and the bread was not the best at all. overall the sea containers bit of our stay and the poor meet and greet service is what has made me give this a poor review. on the second day breakfast was unfortunately pretty much the same situation table was not laid again however was clean this time, and we was instructed on how the breakfast worked this time we will only because i had to say to the girl quickly before she left we was not told the day previous then she told us because she asked when we initially sat down have we had breakfast before i said yes she was like oh fantastic and went to leave but then i said yes but we was not told anything which she then gave us a full instruction / option. we actually was designated the same waiter as the previous day who actually remembered my girlfriends asked for soya milk the day before which he brought over again so kind of half redeemed himself from the day before but the table was still not laid.'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''one of the worst hotels i have ever had to spend the night in. | my partner and i booked this hotel as a last minute/last resort for one night after a night out, and i can honestly say i could barely handle a period of time as short as that. the location and parking are about the only positives to this hotel. the rooms are cold, and you find it literally impossible to relax due to the uncleanliness of the place. i found myself not even wanting to shower through fear of coming out of the bathroom more unclean than what i went in. the hallways of this hotel are filthy and staff are not particularly friendly or welcoming. i will not be returning and i do not recommend this place.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''i stayed there for 5 nights, overall i do not recommend it. | 1- i could sleep well because of vehicle noise, i woke up every night many times when a car passed with high speed, 2- there was no shampoo in the small shower, i had to buy a shampoo and left it when i left 3- most importantly, it is locked very far from the centre london, although transportation is some how ok with that area. | you have the opportunity to make tea or kaffe and a small breakfast also available, staff there are ok. | |'''",0

The Savoy,"'''this was our second visit to savoy. this time we took the standard room, and what a difference. we were treated as if we had just stepped in to take pictures, like by the way many outsiders do, as the hotel shares the court with a theater entrance. service attitude was poor from the beginning when they completely failed us in the check in with our specific instructions (they never called to tell our room was ready and caused hours of unnecessary waiting). staff never explained this, nor compensated this or made any effort to apologize properly. | the historical red elevator went out of order and caused a lot of inconvenience for several days! | on the outside the real issue is the strand, it is very untidy, this location also lacks good tube connections and transportation is a problem. the only real positive was the bed. | we genuinely felt second rate guests, there were quite a few high security vips and it really seemed they absorbed all the attention. i would like to hear if anyone has ever had any benefits from being a president's club member! overall, there is a a very unpleasant feeling of being cashed in by the historic brand name.'''",0
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''photos online are lovely and show a well appointed room with a view. what i do not understand is why my room was wheelchair accessible with a tiny sink, no real vanity area for my wife and a view so bad the hotel frosted the window glass to prevent us from looking out. | i spoke to the receptionist who reminded me rather rudely that i would have received an email telling me my room was wheelchair accessible. she was right. there it was with their offer to upgrade me to a king room for 50lbs more. there also were my email accepting and the hotels confirmation for our king room. | the desk clerk i spoke to said that his records showed us in a queen room (all of which i am now informed are accessible) and by now i am frustrated considering i made my reservations months ago to avoid this type of issue. | we left it to them to sort out while shopping. upon our return they called and offered to make up for their mistake by moving us into the room i had already been promised. | i am not sure how things are done where you come from, but making things up to me does not involve packing up and getting what you contracted for initially. spending an hour of our evening setting up our room, putting clothes back in drawers and resettling just is not how we wished to spend our evening. we were tired and went to bed without dinner. felt like we were punishing ourselves for not picking up in the room switch right away. | in fairness the butler did offer to pack up our room, but i am not comfortable with someone packing my bags. i want to know what does and does not make it into each bag. | so end of day our evening was ruined, we tipped staff for helping us do something we should not have had to do, and as for making up for it, this hotel fell far short. | my wife and i will not be using this hotel for anything other than a sleeping room until we depart for our next destination. spending money in their restaurant and bar would simply be rewarding the management here for not only missing the mark most would expect from a luxury boutique hotel, but even more important is the attitude from the front desk that they are doing us a favor. | i would recommend a pass in this property. if you like old british charm there are other traditional hotels with a nice balance of ambiance and service where you will be made to feel as if the hotel us there for you and not the opposite.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i visited the savoy once again, despite my better judgement, to see if i could manage to get some sort of enjoyment out of the place even though the management seem determined to stamp out the slightest hint of pleasure at every turn. | i popped in to the savoy on sunday evening after spending a marvellous afternoon at cafe boheme in soho, where i would managed to see a live cuban duo thundering away through a long set-list of cuban and afro-jazz classics, and was given a large discount on my bill simply for being a regular and entertaining with my show-boating dancing skills - now that is what i call service and fun! | i thought i would continue the 'fun' by visiting the american bar to see my 'old mate' the pianist/singer belt out a few standards and jazz classics himself. i know the drill by now at the savoy, sit still, do not talk to anyone and under no circumstances have any fun whatsoever - what would the vicar say after all, especially on a sunday! | but after the usual breezy warm welcome by the staff, i was informed that it was a 20 minute wait and that i would have to wait in the lobby by myself, twiddling my thumbs and waiting for, what was i waiting for again? ah music and fun that is it. so, i asked innocently, could i have a glass of wine or a beer or even a glass of water while i waited? i mean i had trekked across town from soho in a rick-shaw (which was wicked fun and highly recommended) and so i was a bit parched. do you know what the reply was from a wonderfully gorgeous waitress/hostess? i shall quote, ""impossible"". | i tried to clarify the situation, you mean to say to me that getting me a glass of wine, or a beer or even a glass of water is ""impossible""? and she said yes. i said, well can i speak to the manager? she brought me over to the floor manager who confirmed what she said that it was ""impossible"" to serve any kind of refreshment whatsoever whilst waiting in the lounge to have my name called to enter the american bar for some refreshments and 'fun'. | i said to one of the staff, as i was leaving after telling her that what was possible, was to watch my back as i walked out of the savoy to somewhere where they did believe in customer service and serving drinks to people and indeed to actually making a bit of money, ""did they spend 200,000,000 on refurbishing the hotel, installing so many bars and restaurants, only to say to customers that it is 'impossible' to serve them drinks?"" | come on the management of the savoy, get your act together whilst you have still got some customers left. | next time, if there is a next time, i shall bring my own refreshments whilst waiting with baited breath to enter the hallowed chambers of the american bar and to experience the exquisite talent that my irish compatriot displays effortlessly on a nightly basis.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''made the mistake of staying at the hotel based on reputation and enjoyment of champagne and all things art deco. | i invited friends to join me in the evening for drinking in the champagne bar and dinner at the ramsay grill. we got no further then the entrance to the champagne bar as we all were wearing (designer) sneakers (and dress shirts and trousers). being on holidays i left my formal footwear at home. we were asked to leave the area and spoken to in such an offensive manner it was noticed by other patrons. we were also told were would be unable to dine in any of the hotels bars or restaurants. for all purposes i could only use the room and foyer, not very impressive when you spend a lot of money on a room. | later that evening when i returned to the hotel there was a note under my door informing me that ""special"" arrangements had been made to have breakfast at the hotel should i wear sneakers in the morning. i am not used to being treated as a second class citizen and choose not to dine in the hotel. | i made a formal written complaint to the hotel, and i could best describe their response as a form (standard letter). | i have on previous occasions stayed at the w in london, same friends, similar clothes, no problem, they know how to deal with young, well dressed, successful people. this was the first such experience having previously stayed at w hotels, waldorf astoria, st regis, park and grant hyatt's etc. | if you think of the savoy, and any of the above would trouble you, i cannot recommend the w london more instead of this hotel.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i am actually still in the hotel right now and unfortunately i have to rate this beautiful and friendly hotel poorly. i was really excited about my stay here but no matter how nice and friendly and cool a hotel is, it is main purpose at the end (at least most of the time) is probably counting with a good night sleep, right? | well, unfortunately my sleep was taken away from me both nights i stayed here. in the room i was staying the first night, a loud sound started at night and again early in the morning, a sound louder than my alarm and that sounds similar to the horn of a cruise ship (i guess it has something to do with the pipes though...) so there is no way you can overhear it and it woke me up at 2am and again at 6am ( meaning 4 hours of actual sleep...) so i kindly asked at the reception to change rooms. the friendly lady in the reception gave me a room 3 floors higher but in the same row, meaning... same pipes... and the sound was even louder!!! | i called the reception last night again feeling pretty frustrated at 1am, when it woke me up, and a technician came up and said he would fix it... but here i am again lying in bed and woken up by the same sound at 6am and again, having had 4 hours of sleep. what is the purpose of staying in a nice, beautiful hotel if you are not allowed to sleep?'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed at the mondrian for my husband's 30th birthday. the room was ok, nothing special, no bath - over priced for what it is. the spa facilities were nice and the treatments were professional however there was no bed in the relaxation section for me afterwards so i left my husband there and returned to our room. room service was pretty average, certainly nothing special and the same goes for the breakfast (buffet style = cold scrambled eggs). these are relatively minor issues when compared to the customer service which is pretty horrendous for a 5 star establishment - do not expect them to call you back or explain their payment procedures. | their processes need serious improvement and staff need customer service training, especially when making a complaint. there are plenty of lovely spa hotels in london to choose from, i would not recommend bothering with this one.'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we get impressed by hotel rhodes website, and the price was very good. but, the website did not show the facts....from the minute we arrived and saw the shabby reception, we had bad feelings...and when we were guided to the hotelroom in the annex, the bad feelings were confirmated. | yes, the price was nice, but too high for the standard of that kind of room. by mail the owner said the rooms were recently refurbished (!!) and were beautiful...! | the room was very small, but that was ok. but it was very, very simple. no paintings or pictures on the wall, just nails....and the room could not have been refurbished the last 10 years. the furniture look old, and outside the room, we could not have any view, because of scaffold gave no view at all. and the window-frame was very dirty. | and the bathroom was terrible! the sink was very, very tiny, and the room was so small that we could not turn around... | so we would not recommend at all this hotel, pay a bit more and get more comfort!!'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''i arrived midday with my son &amp; two grandaughters, we booked a quad room, we knew the room would consist of a double bed (shared by the grandchildren) &amp; two single beds, the room (20) looked reasonably clean, small but sufficient! i noticed a few things that were not quite right, firstly the only light switch was by the door, so once in bed there was no way of turning the light off without getting out of bed as there was no bedside lighting provided, also the room was for four people yet there were only three towels, three cups &amp; three drinking glasses! | we had booked the room so we could stay over for the night whilst we made a first time visit to watch west ham, upton park is approximately a 20 minute walk away, after watching the football we found it near impossible to find an eatery where we felt comforable with the children, we walked in every direction to locate something other than a fast food establishment, not even a pizza hut or weatherspoons in sight! so we had to eat in the local kfc. | i tried to have a shower in the morning after an uncomfortable nights sleep, the room was very noisy with police sirens going all night (police station is located opposite the hotel), the shower was impressive to look at, but was a nightmare to get right! the water was a mere trickle and very hot or very cold, it was extremely difficult to find a medium setting! | we left after breakfast as planned, no problems with the food, plenty of toast, eggs, bacon, mushrooms, sausages etc etc. (cold coffee though) | since arriving home my son &amp; i have both discovered that we have been bitten badly by bed bugs or fleas, i am now constantly itching &amp; scratching...... my original thoughts was that the hotel was ok for the cost, however, given the poor facilities &amp; the persistent scratching i would not use this hotel again, i would happily pay an extra 20-30 to stay somewhere a bit better than this flea-pit!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed in the rembrandt with my partner for 5 nights in december and was extremely disappointed with the attitude of the hotel staff. we arrived in the hotel at 12 midday and were told our room was not ready. we were asked to come back between 12.30 - 1pm. when we returned at 1pm our room was still not ready. the staff made no apologies nor did they offer us an alternative room to change in. this was fairly inconvenient for us as we were attending an event in north london which started at 3pm and we would have liked to check in our bags &amp; freshen up before we left. | when we arrived back at the hotel at 7pm that evening we eventually got to check in to what was the smallest hotel room i have ever seen. it was literally smaller than a regular house bedroom. there was a small double bed pushed against the wall at one side so my partner &amp; i had to get in &amp; out of the same side of the bed. the bed was also right next to the door so we could reluctantly hear everyone is comings &amp; goings. our room was directly across the hall from the inventory room where the cleaning equipment &amp; vaccum cleaners were kept so we were woken up at the crack of dawn every morning by the extremely loud maids. maybe it was just bad luck that we happened to be placed in the worst room in the hotel, but seriously, they need to stop placing two people in what is very obviously a single room. anyway we tried not to let it bother us too much and had a lovely stay in london. | good points about the hotel are its location, down the street from harrods &amp; some other great stores, a short walk from south kensington tube station, the buffet breakfast is quite good and the bar area is very comfortable. | the next time i travel to london i will not book the rembrandt. its a nice enough hotel but the staff really need some customer service training and also need to learn how to smile.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''we were a couple of regular journeymen hoping for a nice place to bed down for the night, but this was akin to face in the sand. from the photos we saw before booking the hotel, it was a hotel of our wildest dreams. false advertisement. it was like it was caught somewhere in time. diabolical mish mash of furniture from different houses from all over of the country, i presume. i could sense the previous owners. and they were made out of mdf. not the previous owners, the furniture. there was black mould on the entire bathroom ceiling. if you are asthmatic, get out now! tv did not work. one redeeming feature is that they has pg tips, but not to be drank until we washed the cups ourselves. | we checked in and instead of going to the left of the reception desk...we were led back outside to a place not even connected to the hotel (hostel, more like!) we wanted to go back out after checking in, but the room did not feel secure. for one, the next door rooms window was right over our balcony...what would stop them entering our room? nothing but a bit of cheap plastic. a child could have prised that door open. fear is the key, so we hid out belongings as best as we could and went where eagles dare - the o2 arena. | the gig was over, it was 2 minutes to midnight, we started our excursion back to the hotel, like a moonchild. as we reached the hotel, holy smoke! my blood brother exclaimed. the lights are on in our room...but how could this be? my blood brother, who was a man on the edge, questioned the man behind the desk. i had the feeling he was a bit power hungry, a powerslave, if you will. we slept in our day clothes that night, for if we were to be attacked, we would at least die with our boots on. when we were at the gates of tomorrow, the long anticipated free buffet style breakfast slipped out of our grasp due to the lack of sleep in that god forsaken place. it was time to go, coming home. if it were not for seeing iron maiden that weekend, it would have been a dance of death! if you value your sanity, you will not stay here. there are better places than this! you are better than this! i am talking to you, dear reader.'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''decent little hotel actually, but do not stay in room 202 the walls are paper thin and you can literally hear everything from kitchen, it sounds like a stampede is coming at you from 7-10, so if you want sleep it is not for you, apart from that nice hotel.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i cannot even begin to tell you how appalled i am with the customer service in this hotel. my son and his girlfriend stayed here in july of this year and were dealt with by the staff with a lack of concern and consideration which left them in london, on the 21st july (day of second wave of bombings) with no money, their train out of london cancelled and nowhere to stay. i have written to the general manager and emailed every member of the management team asking for an explanation but have not had a single reply. when staying at this hotel make sure you know exactly how they are going to take payment and how long it will be before you get your deposit back as they will not offer this information without prompting. | in addition to the above the rooms were tiny and the hotel generally very shabby and in need of updating.'''",0
A To Z Hotel,'''this place is not a hotel ... not even a motel. it is near acton main line station which is not on the main tube map which caused problems trying to find it the first night. then on sunday we found out that trains did not go from that station. the only other option was to walk 15 min down the road to action town station. the rooms were small and the bathroom was even smaller. there needs to be a shower mat as when your taking a shower water goes everywhere. they only gave us half a toilet roll for three days. the mattresses on the beds need to be thrown out ... we could feel the springs and it was three very bad nights sleep. the sheets were clean but there was only a very thin blanket on the beds which meant my father ended up sleeping in his clothes as it was so cold. the radiator did not work and the tv only picked up three channels. we did not try the free breckfast for obvious reasons.''',0
Newham Hotel,"'''my husband, two sons (14 &amp; 11) and i stayed for one night at the newham hotel in rotherham whilst visiting the london stadium for an athletics event. the key card to our room did not work so we were given a new room immediately. our room had a double bed and two singles which was clean but a little dark and quite hot even with the window open. rooms would benefit from a portable fan. breakfast on sunday morning was between 7 and 9am. the hotel boasted an ""all you can eat buffet breakfast"" this should have been more aptly named ""all you can find breakfast"" no plates, no cutlery, no glasses, coffee ran out, no eggs and when they did turn up they were rock hard. guests were constantly asking the two girls for different things. it seemed like they were terribly understaffed, like the chef had not turned in (judging by the eggs!) we left hungry and had to stop at the services on the way home.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''granted we were there on a telegraph selected deal on a saturday evening but in theory it should not make any difference (although we did get the worst table in the place by a constantly swinging service door creating an unpleasant cold draft every time staff came in or out). the menu was quite enticing but the execution was poor; my celery and pecorino soup was tasty but the chickpeas that accompanied my wife's fish starter were rock hard. we both had the fish main course which was averagely cooked and on a bed of tasteless vegetables accompanied by black olive fritters that were unambiguously over-fried (i.e burnt). a plate of cheese was graciously offered in lieu of dessert for madame but the accompanying grapes were for some bizarre reason frozen (as in chunks of ice). my chocolate fondant was as good as any standard pub's with a playful sprinkling of caramelised popcorn for decoration. | although the food was frankly disappointing (bearing in mind that the list cost would have been 67 per head), we were particularly surprised by the service that was way below what is expected in such a venerable institution. for any savoy managers or waiting staff who might be reading this, a reminder of some basics: | 1) when serving a dish, it is nice to get a description (e.g. ""and for madame a herb-incrusted rack of lamb with sweet potato and carrot....(complete as appropriate)). | 2) it may seem old-fashioned, but fish knives for fish would seem appropriate. | 3) before clearing the plates, ask if the guest has finished first (the savoy are not a new york diner). | 4) now and again, ask the guests if they enjoyed their meal (particularly if there is a leftover pile of burnt bits on the plate). you do not really care but apparently it is the done thing. | the wine prices are ludicrous but could be justified if part of a exceptional overall experience but i honestly had more enjoyable food and service at tgi fridays the week before. it is possible that it was a ""bad night"" at the river restaurant based on all the glowing reviews but i have my doubts... | escoffier's legacy this is not by any stretch of the imagination. fortunately, there are hundreds of places with better food, atmosphere and service in london at a fraction of these exorbitant prices.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''my wife and i booked to stay here for the weekend of our 40th wedding anniversary. i booked direct and asked for a bottle of champagne in the room upon arrival. this was confirmed by e-mail. | when we arrived the front desk struggled to find our booking. it was eventually found but at a room rate much higher than i thought i had booked. when i queried this i was loudly asked to provide details to prove the rate. i had not brought paperwork with me and so asked how the booking was made; i was told through an agent. i managed to access my emails but could not immediately find a booking through trip advisor or the other booking site i use. i did eventually find the confirmation; it was a direct booking and not through an agent. the confirmation showed the rate as i recalled it. this was then discussed with the duty manager at the front desk in front of a queue and eventually and grudgingly agreed. not a good start. we dropped our bags and went straight out for dinner and a show. we returned that evening to find the room very noisy. it was dark outside but morning revealed our bedroom window to have a view straight onto a bank of air conditioning units, with the closest one about two feet from our window. ours was a ""club room""! the bottle of champagne did not arrive. we were given a complimentary bottle of red wine (i do not drink red wine) and a very nice card by the customer relations manager. we did not try breakfast next day - in the room rate but we had other plans. however, breakfast on the sunday was better than faulty towers. the ""restaurant"" was full and we were quite rudely told to wait and we would be called in a few minutes. it took ten minutes. it was a canteen style buffet. noisy and quite unappetising. not what am used to from a supposedly ""quality hotel"". location is great and this could be a superb hotel. it is not there yet.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed here for 3 nights (17,18 &amp; 19 dec) to celebrate my wifes birthday. we chose this hotel as we had stayed here before for the exact same dates two years ago and had a very enjoyable time. this time was very different. our booking from booking.com shows we had booked a superior room but this is not what we were given. the room was so small that the double bed had to be sited against the wall which meant that i had to climb over my wife for the usual nocturnal visit to the bathroom. also i could not have a glass of water at the bedside and obviously the was no reading light my side. not ideal for a couple in their sixties. we were informed that the hotel was full so no other rooms were available. we were here, however, to enjoy ourselves and decided to get on with it but this is not what you expect from a 4 star hotel. | when we checked out i asked how many such rooms the hotel had and was informed by the check-out lady that they had only a few; and these were normally reserved for single occupancy but when the hotel is full they were given to couples. i then asked why we were chosen for such a room as we had booked and paid for a superior room on october. at this point she became very coy and stated that someone had to have it. i again i asked why us but she just repeated someone had to have it. | i got the impression that because we had booked via booking.com and had probably paid less that some other guests we were fobbed off with a room that you could not call standard never mind superior.'''",0
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''let me preface this by saying the service was great/the staff was accommodating and professional apart from the concierge and bellhops that were eager to help for tips. but this was the smallest hotel room i have ever had in 40 years of life, even for european or japanese standards. yes - my hotel room in japan was bigger and more reasonably priced than this. | i was disappointed in the high rate for such a small and cramped room which lacked any charm. we had more storage on the airplane (in economy!) for our luggage and belongings. the bed was comfortable, but there was a wool blanket on it. i am allergic, and i have never seen a wool blanket on a boutique hotel room bed. (is this the military?) we were on the top floor and the view was cute (see photos) but not romantic or impressive enough to charge 250+ for a very, very small double room. i had high hopes for a marriott group ""autograph collection"" hotel, in which even the smallest room should be better than a best western or holiday inn - and the service was better - but the room size, comfort, and amenities were disappointing. | plainly said, it was overpriced. the restaurant was too. | if you book here, just know when they say 2 max, they mean 2 person max. so if you want more comfort, book a bigger room or stay elsewhere. i would not book here again unless the other 4-star hotels in the area (meaning, in london) were all sold out.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''if our room was an ""executive"" (lame word) one (that is we paid for), i would hate to see what the normal ones are like. in fact, looking at your website photos, i am beginning to suspect that the room we were given (133) was not in fact in the category we had paid for. one just got the sense that the room was a tired 1970s offering which had had minimal attempts at modernisation applied superficially. the hotel's windows are very badly insulated against the noise of the cromwell road (it calls itself thurloe place at that point, but let us face it, it is still the main east -west artery). having just come from the czech republic and austria ( the latter by no means a cheap member of the eurozone) where we had stayed in five star hotels for a similar amount of money, it was particularly apparent to us that the rembrandt does not represent value for money in any sense. my wife and i had constantly to remind ourselves that we were paying for the location (cromwell road aiside) as we endured three stuffy and mostly sleepless nights in the all too small bedroom. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone other than those with especially low expectations.'''",0

for two people in a ""superior twin"" room, arriving on saturday 1st of august for one night. i paid the full amount upon booking (207.20). i had checked the hotels own (sarova) websitebefore booking, but it was more expensive. | an email i received from the rembrandt a few days prior to our stay informed me that check-in was from 2pm and check-out by 12pm, but offered an early check in and/or late check-out in advance, where avaialable. with our flight time and connecting transport, the 2pm check-in was ideal so we did not avail of this offer. | | we had a lot to squeeze in to our stay and had planned our very short trip accordingly. | | we arrived at the rembrandt reception (after a long morning of travel) just before 2.09pm, and were pleased to find no queue at the reception desk. just a group of people sitting in the reception area and lots of cases. | the receptionist politely informed us that our room was not ready yet, so we would have to wait a while but she could not say how long. not a great start! considering that the hotel offers early check-in, i was surprised that they could not give us our room on time. | | the receptionist then stated that despite having pre-paid the full room rate in advance, i would now have to pay an additional, refundable charge against our room for incidentals. i was given the option to pay 100 cash or to charge 50 against a card. having had no advance warning about this additional charge, i had not factored in this extra 100 into our spending money, which represented a sizeable chunk of it. i had to charge against my debit card (and inadvertently exceeded my overdraft limit in doing so). it would have been less awkward if i had been informed about this incidentals charge policy by the hotel in advance of our trip, perhaps in their email, as i would have brought an extra 100 with me. | | a number of hotels that i have stayed in run your debit card through when checking in, and you sign to say that they can charge against it for anything charged to your room. then they allow you to settle your outstanding bill at check-out. this option is less embarrassing for those on a tight budget. | | considering our time constraints, we now had to change our plan to unpack and grab lunch on the go elsewhere. as we now had to wait for a room key, and aware that our sightseeing and shopping time was getting shorter by the minute, we decided to eat in the hotel bar instead. | the receptionist offered to have someone bring us the key to the restaurant once our room was ready although the key was not brought to us. she also asked a member of the lobby staff to store our suitcase in the meantime, which was placed in a room off reception, and we proceeded to the hotel bar. | the 1606 lounge bar has armchairs and settees with (low) coffee tables so we looked for a higher table in the adjacent conservatory bar which has standard height tables, and after a brief discussion with the lady behind the bar (about not wanting to sit at a coffee table to eat lunch), we were seated at a small table in the conservatory bar. | being in a hurry to get our key and go, having read the menu, we quickly ordered 2 soft drinks, a stone-baked margherita pizza (which we asked for without the slices of tomato mentioned on the menu), and a burger. | | in my opinion, service was slow considering that the place was not busy (with 5 or so tables occupied including ours, most of whom were having a drink and/or cold sandwiches). | my burger which was served with chips and a little bowl of side salad, was pretty unremarkable. the pizza however will remain in my memory for quite some time to come. | my daughter loves margherita pizza, and always orders it whenever we go to italian restaurants. she likes it with just the tomato sauce and mozzarella, which is exactly what she had ordered. what arrived was entirely different. i immediately noticed its strange appearance but chose not to mention it as my daughter was very hungry and i did not want to put her off. | it was a sea of melted pale yellow cheese with blotches of melted orange cheese - far too much cheese and it looked as if it had been removed from the oven much too early. the orange cheese may have been a red leicester, a mature cheddar, kraft cheese or some other orange cheese, but to be honest we do not know what type of cheese it was as it had not been mentioned on the menu, and we had not requested it. | the rembrandt bar menu online is the same menu that we ordered from, and this was not the pizza described therein. we had expected the (pale yellow) mozzarella, which is normal for a margherita pizza in any restaurant, but the orange cheese was a shock. the cheese looked as if it had only just started melting it had not started to brown at all. | | whilst there was an abundance of cheese, there appeared to be no tomato sauce layer, which you would expect to see at the edge of the crust, and between the cheese and the dough. if it was there, we did not find it. perhaps having asked for no tomato slices, whoever made this pizza had decided not to bother putting the tomato sauce on it either. | i assumed it could only taste better than it looked | my daughter tried to cut a slice but could not due to the texture of the base. a pizza cutter would have made little difference, had one been provided, which it was not. | other than at the very outside edge, the base had not solidified enough to be sliced. it was not thin and crispy, nor was it a deep-pan base. away from the outside edge it was amalgamating with the cheese above it. it was like no base i have ever encountered. it simply was not cooked through properly, or the dough ingredients were incorrect, or something else had gone drastically wrong. it had been described on the menu as stone-baked. maybe someone should have warmed up the stones for longer! | having skipped breakfast due to our much earlier than usual start, my daughter was extremely hungry. as it could not be sliced, my daughter spent at least 5 minutes trying to get some of the pizza negotiated onto her fork using her knife, with limited success, as it was not solid enough to stay on the fork. fighting a losing battle and having stated that it was horrible, and with approximately 90% of the pizza untouched, she gave up on it. she had managed only about 3 mouthfuls of it, for which i feel she deserved a medal for effort. | i then tasted it myself cutting a little piece off near the more solid outer edge. i had to agree with her that it was the worst pizza either of us had tried, as the texture was not right and nor was the taste. i could not make a pizza this badly if i tried! i wish i had taken a photo of it, but my daughter told me not to embarrass ourselves by doing that in front of other diners. we decided instead to send it back to the kitchen so that someone would address the obvious state of it: a soggy, sauce-less, over-cheesed, undercooked mess. | when the waiter eventually came back with my second soft drink i asked him to take away the pizza. i was pleasant rather than confrontational, as i did not wish to because a scene, and i reasoned that he had not made this offending item himself. | he asked if she did not like the pizza. he kept a straight face in doing so, despite the shocking appearance of it. i wondered how he had not noticed that this pizza was certainly not what a 4 star hotel should be sending out to a customer in their restaurant. it should never have left the kitchen. | three weeks on, and with my previous review removed i cannot now quote our exact conversation, which was brief, but i can still remember telling him that she could not eat it as it was bad or not good. i told him it was too soggy (although i could have listed the many ways that it was offensive to both the eye and palette). he thought i said too salty, so i repeated myself, and told him that that it w as too soggy (not salty). i stated that it was so bad that she could not eat it. | he asked if she would like another one (so at least he had a sense of humour) or if she would like to order something else, which we politely declined. after our experience with the disgraceful pizza we would not have ordered anything else to eat there again. | he then took the offending item away. | this is only the second time in my 44 years on this planet that i have sent food back to a kitchen with a complaint. | i was hoping to have a manager, supervisor, chef, or indeed whomever had made this awful attempt at pizza, apologise for the state of it or in the very least to attempt to explain to us what went wrong with it. even better, id love to have seen any one of the afore-mentioned try to cut a slice of this gloopy pizza, or taste it. | no-one came forward. no apology was made to us. our complaint was totally ignored. | when our bill arrived, we were charged for this disgraceful pizza anyway. 12.95 (plus 10% service charge!). disgraceful! | i kept my cool, deciding (rightly or wrongly) that they obviously did not care about food quality or customer satisfaction in this bar/restaurant, and i charged the 40.15 to our room, as they were already holding back 50 against my card. | | incidentally i also tipped the waiter (10%) before noticing that they had our bill included a service charge already. the menu mentioned a discretionary service charge of 10%, but in our case this charge was mandatory, despite the pizza disaster. | anyway i realise that i have hammered on about that pizza, but three weeks later i still feel aggrieved that someone deemed it acceptable to serve an over-cheesed and under-cooked pizza which was not even the one that we ordered (as we had not requested any orange cheese and despite asking for no sliced tomato we did not ask them for no tomato sauce on the base), and which was totally sub-standard, and that they still charged us for it without an apology from the kitchen or supervisor for the state of it. | i must move on as this was only the start of our short staybut unfortunately this was not our only issue. | as no-one had brought our key to the bar, we went back to reception to see if our room was now ready, which it was. we were given the key to room 232, and the cheerful receptionist asked a male member of lobby staff to retrieve our case for us, but as he looked quite put out by this simple request, i did not tip him. | | our room was at the end of a corridor, near a staircase, with quite a few doors (including cupboard or service doors) close to it. | the room was clean and the air conditioning was set to a perfect temperature (with controls to adjust this, as preferred). a card had been left at the light switch keypad near the door, so that we did not need to use our door key cards to put the lights on when needed. this was a good idea, as other hotels i have stayed in do not provide that extra card for the lights. | it was not a very large room, but an adequate size for 2 of us staying one night. although described as a superior room, it was the cheapest type of room in this hotel, and was quite basic, so i am not sure what it was superior to. | the twin beds were pushed tight together with a small wall-mounted bedside cabinet at either side. the duvets were anchored in tightly between the two bed mattresses, so i presume that with a change to a larger duvet, this room could also be used as a double room. there would not have been adequate space to separate the beds even had the units not been there. | there was a round table with 2 armchairs, and a display of magazines arranged on top of it, at the foot of the bed(s). | there was a larger cupboard unit opposite the beds, between the window and the door, with a small flatscreen tv on top. this unit housed a tea/coffee tray, and i think there was also a mini-bar in that unit too (i do not know for sure as we did not open that door), neither of which we availed of. | there was a dressing table with three small drawers and a vanity mirror opposite the corner window, and also a separate drawer unit with two or three deeper drawers, with rails on top of it for suitcase storage. | the wardrobe had plenty of hangers, and an iron, and a small safe on the floor, which could be activated by inserting the room door key card and choosing your own 4 digit passcode. | the view from our window was drab, overlooking the industrial rooftop of what i assume to have been the ground floor of the hotel. as we did not plan to spend any time in the room other than to sleep, shower, and have breakfast, the view did not matter very much to us. it was none-the-less not a pleasant view. | the bathroom was clean, with a white suite and dark marble flooring. there were monogrammed hotel bathrobes hanging behind the door, but only 2 large towels and 2 hand towels between us. there was only one of each of the bathe toiletries (a gilchrist &amp; soames product) provided between two people. more would have been appreciated. | the bath was a normal size and shape but incorporated a jacuzzi feature, which we did not try out, despite the instructions for use that were provided above it. it would have been a good idea to have provided similar instructions for using the overhead shower. through trial and error, i got it to work eventually somehow, with lots of different combinations of twisting. | there was a gap between the top edge of the bath panel and the bottom lower edge of the bath top, nearest the door, which narrowed as it neared the centre. the bath panel had either been put on at an obvious angle or had dropped at that end. i used one of the small towels to drape over this gap for the duration of our stay as i have a fear of spiders and did not care to contemplate whether any might have made their home in there. having submitted my original review 3 weeks ago drawing attention to this, hopefully this panel has since been rectified. | if so, hopefully the hotel also instructed their maintenance team to investigate the other issue with this room that i mentioned also: the gradient at which the left hand bed in that room was sloping. there was a noticeable dip downhill towards the headboard and outer edge at the top of the bed. either the bed or the mattress (or both) needed to be replaced, as no one wants to sleep with their head in a dip. | | had i been staying more than one night or had we lots of time to spare i would have complained to reception immediately, and asked for a different room. as a replacement bed or mattress (or both) seemed unlikely to be provided before bedtime had we reported this, and in light of how long it took us to get our room key, i decided to just make the best of a bad situation for the sake of one night. | | i decided that rather than risk blood running to my head all night, i would use one of my daughters pillows and the 2 cushions to compensate for the slope, as she had spotted the slope too and had wisely chosen the flat bed for the night. | we unpacked, and freshened up, and oyster cards in hand we then headed off to make the most of what was left of our day. | the rembrandt is in a nice area, and is within 2 minutes walk of the nearest underground stop (south kensington), heading left when you exit the hotel. there are a lot of restaurants and shops nearby also. we headed to oxford street though for some retail therapy. | we came back much later, having had dinner elsewhere, and left the hotel again just after 10.30pm, to attend an exhibition across the road. the immediate area around the hotel felt safe to walk in at night as there were plenty of people about at that time, and likewise on our way back again, shortly before midnight. we did not notice anyone manning the reception desk when we arrived back at the hotel, as we made our way to the lift. (incidentally you need your keycard to activate the lift, which is good for security reasons.) | after a very long day, we were both looking forward to a good nights sleep and a lie in, so we planned to have breakfast as late as possible. | at only 3 (per tray) we thought that room service breakfast was a great idea. i completed the room service breakfast card that was sitting on the desk, and put it out on the door handle/knob as instructed, at about midnight. the card said this could be done any time up to 4am, so ours was out with hours to spare. | i think that room service breakfast is a great idea as it saves time going down to the breakfast room, and possibly having to wait for a breakfast table to become available when it is often very busy towards the end of service time, when we wanted to eat. i have learned from experience that if you go late to a hotel breakfast room, occasionally they may have run out of specific items. | surely by paying an extra charge for room service breakfast, and giving plenty of notice of exactly which items you would like, all of which are listed on the choices) you can be assume that you will get the breakfast that you have asked for? surely they set aside room service items in good time, before they run out of anything? surely they do not ask you what you want, and then give you something else instead!? surely if they ran out of an item that you had asjked for they would ring your room and ask if you would like something else? i really do not think my expectations of room service in a 4 star hotel are too high!? | we expected to get what we ordered, but that is not what we got in the rembrandt hotel! | before getting on to our breakfast experience though, i should first mention my night spent in the sloping bed with two cushions and the pillows somewhat compensating for the downward gradient of the head of the bed/mattress. | | having managed to fall asleep shortly after 1am, i was rudely awakened at approximately 2am or thereabouts by the sound of a loud slam of a door, which sounded so close that i thought that someone had just broken into our room. it gave me the fright of my life, but once i had checked that our door was secure i reasoned that it must have been the door of the next room, or another door nearby. | | it took a while to get back to sleep, and then it happened again. this time it was less of a shock, but it was extremely annoying. by the fourth slam i realised that there was no point trying to sleep. as my daughter sleeps through alarm clocks and could probably sleep through the sound of an atom bomb going off, but not a light shining in her face, i was left with only the intermittent slams for company. | (i had thought that it might be the double doors at the nearby stairs. before checking out i checked these doors and they do not bang shut.) it may have been guests attending the same 24hr exhibition across the road that we had been to ourselves earlier, however it could also have been storage, service or cleaning doors. | i decided that i would bring up this issue (and the sloping bed) at check-out instead, when asked about our stay, despite having already had our complaint about the pizza ignored in the hotel restaurant. | room service arrived on time, at about 10.25am (within the time slot we requested) with one tray, which was placed on our little table. i could see our drinks on the tray but the food was covered over with a napkin. i signed for the tray without checking that the order was correct after all we had put in a very short order for only 2 cold food items each, both of which were listed individually on the card. no special requests were made, and no-one had contacted us to say that any item was unavailable or to ask us to choose alternatives to them. having ordered items they obviously stock, i assumed we would get those items. so when our tray was set on the table with the napkin over the food, it just never occurred to me that there was any problem with our short and simple food order. | i tipped the man who brought our tray (noticing again that they had added a 10% service charge to the 3 tray charge also), and he left before i lifted the napkin. | on our room card we had ordered the following items: 3 glasses of fruit juice, 2 coffees (no milk), 2 croissants, and 2 pain-au-chocolat. simple! | i could have ordered bacon, sausage, eggs, cereal, porridge, bread, other types of pastries, or a number of other items from the choices provided on the card, but i did not because we did not want any of those things. we ordered just what we wanted. exactly what we wanted. not too much to ask for surely!? | well the drinks order was correct, so they must have at least read part of our card, but they ignored the rest, as we did not get our requested pain-au-chocolat and croissant each. they decided instead to just send us a generic basket of 4 or 5 mixed mini pastries (despite these not having been ticked on our card) - and one croissant. there was absolutely no pain-au-chocolat! | we go just one of the four food itemswe asked for to share between two people. no-one had bothered to ring ahead, and the man who brought them did not mention any problem with our order, so we had no opportunity to ask for alternatives, and breakfast is served until 10.30, and now it was too late for us to chase up our missing croissant and 2 pain-au-chocolat, or to request something else instead of the generic basket of unwanted pastries that they had fobbed us off with. | having planned our day down to the hour, we wanted to leave by 11am to get everything done, so there was no time for us to waste ringing room service to ask for the correct items that we had actually ordered and not got, having asked on the card for the items only to be ignored, i did not wish to be fobbed off with apologies or excuses for this shoddy breakfast experience. the quality of the pastries was not the problem, it was the fact that they did not bother to ring ahead to check if we would prefer something else if they had not bothered to set aside 4 simple cold breakfast items for our tray. | my daughter did not want any of the items in the basket that we had not ordered. she really wanted her pain-au-chocolat (and had planned to eat both, as i would have swapped mine for her croissant), which they had not given us. she did not eat a thing. she decided to wait and get breakfast somewhere else instead, and insisted that i take the one and only croissant, which i ate. i also ate a couple of the mini pastries (which we had not ordered) as i was hungry, but she would not even taste them. they were nice enough but they were not what i had ordered. the coffee did not taste nice at all, so i left it. | | we made our way to reception, with our case (that id mostly packed already, during my night of listening to doors slamming), to check out before 11am, to go about our planned day of museum visits etc before our evening flight home. only now we had to factor in breakfast elsewhere for my daughter too! i managed to keep a smile on my face as i was not going to let room service ruin our day. | at reception we were greeted with a smile and given a copy of our bill for the room with receipt, and the lady refunded the 6.55 remainder of my 50 back onto my card. | i asked the receptionist about road closure affecting traffic and tube services, which she was able to advise us about. then i asked whether we could leave our case for a few hours in left luggage, which she said we could, and she called over a male lobby attendant to take our case. | the same unsmiling gentleman was working on sunday in the lobby and he still did not look happy to be there. | i expected the receptionist to ask whether we had enjoyed our stay, but she did not. i could have spent a good 10 to 15 minutes(or more) on that subject, instead of spending considerably longer writing this review. | | having worked for a tourist board myself previously (although this review is entirely based on my own experiences and is not in any way the opinion of that board), and having stayed in plenty of hotels in my time, i was surprised that the receptionist did not ask me about my stay upon check-out, as that is a standard practice within the hospitality industry. | as we were genuinely in a rush to get on with our plans for the day elsewhere, and just glad to be leaving the hotel behind us for a few hours, we left on foot. we returned to the rembrandt at about 2.30pm to retrieve our case, use the toilet facilities (downstairs, below the lounge bar) and to arrange a taxi to take us to victoria train station. | i approached the reception desk staff to ask for our case, which the unsmiling gentleman was again asked to locate, and which he again delegated to someone else who cheerfully found it for us. i asked the receptionist if she could order a taxi to collect us, so she asked one of the (happy) male lobby staff to flag one down for us outside. | i carried our case outside to the kerbside (down a few steps, as he had not taken it with him). once we got to the kerb he said that we could wait inside as it might take a short while, but we preferred to wait outside. upon noticing our case he said that he would have been happy to have carried it outside. he was very pleasant, but a little too late with this offer. less than 5 minutes later we were in our taxi, having tipped the happy lobby attendant for his help. | when you book a superior room in a well-regarded 4 star hotel in south kensington, at 207.20 for 2 people sharing a twin room, with breakfast included, then i think its only reasonable to expect that both of the beds will be comfortable, and that breakfast will be what you ordered rather than what someone else deems to give you instead. i also believe that if a guest finds food so unpalatable that they send it back to the kitchen, that someone should take an interest in why this has happened, and address it at the time. | i have written a number of reviews for restaurants and hotels, and i believe that i am fair. i include any good points even when i have had a particularly bad experience. in all honesty though, based just on our short stay, i personally would not recommend this hotel. | i have given it two stars rather (than just one) out of five because had i not experienced the pizza episode, nor been given the room with the sloping bed, and had i not been kept awake by the banging doors, followed by the delivery of the wrong breakfast by room service, the many other small issues (late check in, slow bar service, sloping bath panel, terrible view from our room, minimal towels and minimal toiletries, etc) were only minor. i can see that this hotel could have been a nice place to stay had i not encountered all of the above issues. unfortunately i did experience all of these things, and it really affected our trip, which we had both been really looking forward to. | i have not written this review to try to get anything back from this hotel. i do not want a free nights accommodation, a free upgrade, a voucher, a free pizza, a free breakfast, or a champagne reception with a red carpet rolled out upon my arrival, if i were ever to decide to give it a second chance. | i hope to be back in london again in the next 6 months for a family break (this time for all four of us), but the fact is that we will stay elsewhere. i know that i will never set foot through the doors of the rembrandt hotel again. a good nights sleep is too precious to me, and this hotel cost me one. there are plenty of other hotels who have provided myself and my family with a much better service than this one, plus numerous others still to try. | i would hope that having read and responded to my original review written 3 weeks ago, that the rembrandt would by now have rectified the sloping bed and bath panel in room 232. | | although i will not be back, hopefully the hotel might take on board some of my suggestions below to ensure that no future guests have the same experiences as myself: | installation of a soft close mechanism on the doors in and around guest accommodation would rectify the particular noise issue that kept me (and perhaps others) up almost all night. failing that, a sign in the lifts or displayed prominently within the rooms to politely remind all guests to please close their room doors gently out of respect for fellow guests, would be a great idea. | at least one member of kitchen staff urgently requires (re)training in pizza-making. | room service should be instructed to contact guests to offer alternative choices, if they cannot deliver anything that a guest has ordered. | senior catering staff should engage with guests whenever they receive a complaint, whenever food is returned, rather than waiting for a written complaint to arrive at a later date. | food returned with good reason should never be added to a customers bill. | lobby staff should all (rather than just the majority) smile whenever guests are present. as all front-of-house staff are representives of your hotel (and the sarova group), a good impression is important and a smile costs nothing but goes along way. (i managed to smile when i went through reception, despite my annoyance at the lunch and breakfast episodes.) | reception staff should always ask guests how their stay was at check-out, rather than assume that if a guest has had any issues that they will bring it up un-prompted. it also makes the guest feel valued. | one additional line should be added within the generic email that you send guests prior to arrival to inform them of the refundable charge, stating how much it is. this saves potential embarrassment to your guests. | if rooms are not ready when a guest arrives (on time) for check-in, offering a complimentary coffee while they wait would be a nice gesture (although hopefully not the coffee that room service brought us!). | i wish the rembrandt hotel well and hope that they take as much of this on board as possible, as my suggestions are given in good faith and based purely on our stay.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,'''my recent 4 night stay at corinthia london was very disappointing and in relation to the prices they charge i expected a lot more ...i stayed in room 214 which had nice bathroom but however the bedroom was very standard what you would find in any hotel with 2 tiny closets for luggage and clothes...my biggest complaint is that my room was freezing cold and i spoke to housekeeping on 3 different occasions to try and have ac controls repaired. they brought an engineer but it was still freezing afterwards . when sitting at table near balcony window there were terrible draughts around the window which is not double glazing . in the end i had to request a heater which was finally rolled in (on 3 wheels 1 broken) after 40 mins and 2 further calls to housekeeping ...staff were indifferent and from older reviews i see that this problem of temperature control had occured previously so its not a new issue...also on check out when i checked over my bill an extra 74 had been added to my bill for mini-bar items which i had not consumed and which was removed without question when i pointed it out...one wonders do they add on amounts randomly which people sometimes end up paying for if in a rush checking out...final word to management : sort out the glitches they ruin the experience ! beware anybody visiting if you are allocated room 214 !!! i would not return ever | the courtyard area below the balcony of my room had lairy drunks screaming till early hours of the morning so poor sleep quality also''',0
The Rembrandt,"'''unfortunately it was one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in. right from the start everything was wrong. when we entered the front receptionist was on the phone. she did not register us although i am sure she saw us. she kept the phone after a good few minutes and then without a smile addressed us. no warmth, no welcome. our room was not ready and i understand we were early. they allowed us to use the spa area to change. this was perhaps the only helpful thing from the staff. the room did not deserve to be 2 star, i am surprised who labelled them 4 star. poor carpet quality, uncomfortable and tiniest sized beds, pillows and not upto the standard bathrooms. poor sound insulation - very creaky. big gap under the door. took me a long time to find find a kettle in the room. we asked for directions on 3 occasions and everytime they gave us wrong directions and for everything you asked, they expected you to tip you, or at least this is how it seemed. | the worst 210 i have ever spent.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''was hoping for a classic, top quality hotel but instead got over inflated egos and sub-standard service. staff that are more interested in their appearance and themselves rather than the guests. they either ignore or patronise you. in real 5 star hotels the bell boys do not awkwardly pause, waiting for you to hand out a tip (they know better), but apparently not here. the room we had was small, hot and when we had a problem with our t.v. remote not working we spent 20 minutes on the phone just trying to get through to someone. they then took 45 mintes to respond, resulting in over an hour of messing around for a remote control! we were also disturbed by the road noise at night and early in the morning. not good. the restaurants and bars are ridiculously over priced and understaffed. conclusion: just because you spend a small fortune on staying at a "" top "" hotel do not expect top service.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my husband and i stayed here for one night , after carefully selecting a nice hotel on the south bank as we were visiting shakespeare's globe. | first impressions were ok, the lobby and public areas are sleek and trendy. however, having booked a superior room, we were disappointed to see we were actually given a disabled room, with a poor shower in the corner of the bathroom. we should have complained but quite frankly could not be bothered as we were tired when we arrived. | the location is lovely, and we had cocktails in the rooftop bar. the bar was nice but the waiter completely forgot my drink, having promptly brought my husband's beer he walked past me numerous times and did not notice that 15 minutes later i still had not had my drink until i had to tell him. | we then went out for dinner and we subsequently kept awake much of the night by groups of drunken girls shrieking and shouting until the early hours. | the same group were then in the restaurant for lunch the next day, and the sound was deafening. therefore we opted to eat out again and did not sample the hotel's restaurant at all. i later walked in the toilets to find one of them being sick, surrounded by her loud friends. | i think if you are young and looking for a good party hotel, this is it. otherwise, avoid. it is definitely not worth the 5 stars it is been given. we were extremely dissatisfied with our stay'''",0
The Savoy,'''this hotel is extremely overpriced and extremely over rated. the afternoon tea was shocking and when one called for room service one had to wait for an hour until some man bought me tea in a chipped tea cup with most of my tea splashed on the side. the was not good and one could not get to sleep because of all the noise outside. because of my tiredness my buisness deal was lost the next morning. one was hoping to be relaxed but one got the exact opposite. afternoon tea was expensive and the service was sloppy. i would highly reccomend that you do not stay at this hotel.''',0
The Savoy,"'''the savoy | i am afraid i was disappointed. the stay got off to a bad start. i booked with a consolidating agent (amoma) and then asked the hotel to have coffee making facilities in the room before i arrived (they do not have a nespresso machine in each room like most hotels, its sachets i am afraid,) it was the first time id used an agent so i was a little apprehensive incase the booking went a-stray, a fear confirmed later by valentyna who told me there was no reservation and asked if i had perhaps booked under another name. i replied that it was the correct name on the booking. i contacted amoma and they told me that they had sent the details of the reservation ahead to the hotel and they had contacted the hotel on my behalf and were waiting for a reply. to cut a long story short; after 5 emails from me that were all ignored i received confirmation, one week later, on the train on the way to the city from corina. she told me that the reservation had been received - just as well since id prepaid. i let it rest; gave the hotel the benefit of the doubt and checked in. | check in was fast after being taken into a grand office style room rather than at a reception desk. i was taken to my room- a mixed opinion. having seen all of the savoy public areas which are beautiful; the lobby is lavish, the restaurant design is fantastic and unusual compared to most other hotel restaurant, i maybe expected better. it was fairly standard claridges style art-deco with an absolutely lovely bathroom and a view into an office across the road. the room i was allocated had also obviously been used by a smoker prior to make stay. there was that stale smoke smell in the bathroom and holes had been burned in the nets. the room i booked was a luxury king and i was down graded at check in to a deluxe room but assured there was no difference. the hotel blamed amoma, by now i was thinking if the electricity went off the hotel would probably blame amoma. they were probably also responsible for the vacuum cleaner that lived everyday outside my room. | on the other hand the food was excellent, both from room service and in the restaurant and not especially expensive. i stayed for 5 nights and ate at least once per day at the hotel and my bill was not excessive. the coffee and eclairs from melba (thrown at you by the most unpleasant waitress you have ever met) are delicious. the door men remember your name and are also happy and very friendly, intact they stand out as probably the best hotel staff i have met. one of the waiter from portugal, i forget his name, was also very friendly and efficient. but other than that staff were generally standard. | on check out i was given my bill and returned my room card. this time at a reception; i was asked how my stay was and if i needed any assistance with transfer to the airport or the station. sorry - i should have been asked how my stay was and if i needed any assistance with transfer to the airport or the station. instead the lady took my invoice and started doing something with it and i left. the door man said goodbye. following this i received a generic (copy and paste) apology following my survey. not a good experience at all when there are so many excellent hotels in london.'''",0
Hartley Hotel,"'''as we arrived there were dodgy looking characters at the front door, made us uneasy. we asked politely if our heavy case could be taken to our room, but we were told no. | when we actually got to the room there was a disgusting stench of stale smoke along with visible cracks/holes/burn marks sllover the room. the chairs were unclean and the toilet was broken, also the bathroom stank of urine. | this was a last minute booking, off the cuff, we decided to look at reviews on here when we arrived. and to top it off it confirmed our suspicions that this ""hotel"" was in fact being used by prostitutes. we heard sex noises in the morning before we left and genuinely feared for our safety. | do not stay here!!!'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''the website is extremely misleading. i booked a london trip through a company and they booked this hotel for me and my husband. where do i start--there was black mold in the ceiling of the bathroom and on the wall by the windows. the windows did not lock either. very scary being in a shady neighborhood. it is a 20-25 minute walk just to the metro and bus station. it is not the closest to the center city. the wall sockets stuck out to where i had to hold in my phone charger until it stayed and held the charge. the tv remote did not work and the replacement i was given did not either. also, i cut myself the night prior and a little blood was on the sheet. the next night when we went to bed the spot was still there!! they did not change them, just made the bed! disgusting! you can hear everything going on--outside and above floors--so we woke up quite a bit. all furniture was scuffed in some way or another. no shampoo was given, just a bar of soap--about the size of two quarters! no floor mat, or washcloths, just two towels. not even a phone in the room to make local calls. i asked to use the office phone (to book a tour) and they told me to use the pay phone outside. the cleanliness was the worst for me and my husband.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''we thought we would treat ourselves to a stop over following a shopping trip. great check in experience. we could not get a table at the grill for dinner till 9.30pm. not great so we decided to have room service. this was okay. good steak! no mini bar price list, no complimentary tea/coffee on offer or facilities. air con not heating in room. tv not working. technician came to fix but could not. no offer to change rooms. we had no tv for the stay! breakfast good. we had been told there would be a 200 reserve on credit card as the room and breakfast had been paid for. instead over a thousand was reserved on my credit card. the receptionist was very unhelpful snd said it was a mistake and she cannot explain it. she shrugged her shoulders and said we could change rooms for the last 45 minutes of our stay! we asked to see a manager and she said she was the manager!! we insisted on someone else. she eventually removed the room service charge which was 116! offered us an upgrade at our next stay and promised a tv! we wasted a lot of time being dragged through a horrible experience at reception. what a shame!'''",0

Newham Hotel,'''room looked ok but on entering the room an almighty smell hit us in room 4 a very strong smell of mould it was that bad it was making me choke. i reported it and asked for some air fresher expecting them to leave us with a can but no a squirter will do which lasted all of 5 minutes and then the horrendous smell was back. we ended up walking to a shop to buy some. the fresher took the smell of temporarily but was soon at the back of you are throat again and up you are nose. we tried to open the windows which clearly has not been opened for years because they appeared glued. with help from a staff member we managed to get a windows open. the shower not the best a trickle of water was all you got and the shower tray leant backwards so struggled to stay upright. 3 in a room and only 1 twin socket which is not hood when tv is plugged in and we all want to charge a phone. good points wifi great breakfast and easy to find.''',0
The Dorchester,"'''my husband pre- booked and payed for myself, mum &amp; mother in law as a surprise for a 'me time spa day' via treatwell | when calling the hotel they booked our treatments (the package included lunch and a facial and use of the facilities) and took a credit card to secure the treatments which i thought was a little odd but did not question. | today we have been to the spa and could not fault the whole experience - from checking in, to our bento box lunch, to an amazing rose facial with tatianna and the relaxing facilities this wonderful hotel has to offer. | when we were leaving the staff on reception asked how our spa day was and we were all very complimentary until one of the ladies ran after me and asked if i had payed. walking back into the spa reception i said yes of course everything had been pre booked and paid by my husband. she then continually said nothing had been paid, so out of horror i found my phone and the confirmation email that my husband has forwarded on and showed it. it clearly said it was booked via treatwell and paid upfront. it was all getting very embarrassing, there were other people in the reception and i went from being very relaxed to very irritated (the whole point of the spa day was to unwind!). after five minutes of back and forward and the lady still staying that the card was not charged and that i needed to pay (450!!!) another lady on reception came over and took over. she asked my name again and then looked on the system and apologised and said that they have only started using treatwell bookings and not sure how to check the confirmation. | the other lady (i did not get her name but she was english, short with a hair parted in the middle) did not apologise and just said ok all done??!! | what a shame - i left feeling embarrassed and have an extremely annoyed husband too when i told him what had happened - a disappointing ending to what was a lovely afternoon. | do not book via treatwell unless you want to be accused of walking out and not paying with no apologies!!!! i suggest you get your staff trained on these systems - or at least some customer service skills. i have only rated this poor due to this, otherwise i would have given excellent five stars.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''after travelling to london on saturday 20th april, my family and i arrived at the mandarin hotel at roughly 4pm, to see if we were able to book a room to stay for the night. upon arrival i walked inside the hotel and was met by an eastern european gentleman in a top hat who asked if he could help me. i said i was looking for reception and for the toilet so i could get a couple of tissues for my young child who was incredibly hot and bothered. upon hearing this the gentleman told me that the hotel does not have any toilets. i said that this must be a lie. he then said that the toilets were for guests only. i informed him i was trying to book a room for the night, upon this the man stated that he would walk me to reception, i could then book a room and then i could get some tissues for my child. | never in my life have i been so disrespected at a supposed 5 star hotel. the man must of thought i was below him to stay at this establishment. i immediately left in a taxi with my family and we went and got a room at the savoy. will never entertain a mandarin oriental ever again after this experience. shocking,'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''hotels can be like people, in that their beauty is sometimes only skin-deep. | yes, this is a beautiful classic hotel in an incredible location. however, when a hotel is one of the most expensive in london, and by extension, the world, you expect them to provide hospitality, not just the appearance of such. the staff and management at this hotel were adeptly trained at going through the motions of a 5 star hotel. they were incredibly good of putting on the appearance of the staff from ""upstairs/downstairs"" or some other classic period piece with constant greeting of ""good evening, sir. how are you sir? are you enjoying your stay, sir?"" | they made the effort so often, i actually got tired of it by the 2nd day and started doing my best to avoid them. | however, when we actually engaged them in any request that was not exactly to the script, they could not respond, or did so with a smugness that bordered on contempt. we were so bristled by the repsonses of the hotel staff that we moved out halfway through our stay. | when we asked the concierge to make a reservation at a new restaurant recommended by a friend, he responded with a haughty tone that implied that as he was not aware of it, it must not be that good. (yes, it was.) | the next morning, at breakfast, my wife ordered for herself and my son, but i asked the server to return in a minute, as i had not had a chance to look at the menu. the server not only did not return, but brought my wife and son their food and left again with my plate completely empty and my order not taken. when i called the manager over to inform him that no one took my order, he said he would have eggs brought for me right away. the only problem was that i do not eat eggs and never ordered any. the manager just assumed i did rather than asking me. | when my wife requested the cleaning staff to make up our beds in the late afternoon after my son had a nap, the woman who came did so with a thinly veiled comment that implied that it was an inconvenience for her to do so. | there are more examples i can tell to illustrate that these were symptomatic of a greater problem, not just isolated incidents. we finally felt the need to check out and move to the halkin, a gem of a hotel with a michelin-starred restaurant and staff that truly understands service and attention. the mandarin's staff only understood putting on airs rather than following through with real care.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''the quality of service spoilt our stay here. the room was not ready by the evening, and my boyfriend was irritated that the champagne and birthday cake he had ordered in advance were also not in the room when he was finally able to check in. there was no answer from the reception desk despite ringing them a few times, so he had to return to the reception desk to make his enquiry. the corridors smelt of stale tobacco smoke. the room was comfortable as you would expect, but the experience was quite disappointing. he complained the following morning and received a discount on the room.'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we stayed one night at this hotel. well, actually it was down the street and around the corner from the rhodes hotel at another owned hotel, the argos. it was also four flights up, in a narrow stairway to the top floor. neither of these items were disclosed in advance, for us to make an informed decision on the room. had we known the location of the room and that fact that is was not actually at the rhodes, we would have not booked it. service was fine. the person who checked us in was very nice to have carried our luggage up the four flights. the next morning we purchased a meal, which was fine. i do not think we would stay at this hotel, or wherever we would be shuttled when we got there, again.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''this is not a good hotel, not even up to 3 star. on arrival we, a couple, were allocated a smoking room with 2 single beds although we had specified double on booking and non-smoking. the re-allocated room was below travelodge standard and in need of upgrade with broken bed frame and depressing colour scheme. | we tried the bar meal and chose the steak. the wrong order was delivered and i had to send mine back as not cooked to request. the food was awful and service poor. the breakfast was also cold. | we hastily re-arranged our 2nd night in london to stay elsehwre, it was that bad.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''my friend and i decided to treat ourselves and were really looking forward to our champagne afternoon tea at the savoy during our weekend trip to london. whilst we enjoyed it, it could certainly have been better and we cannot help feeling disappointed. the staff were very friendly and helpful and we had two of them looking after us initially. unfortunately it seemed as though we had hit staff break time as they both disappeared one after another, leaving us with no tea and not being looked. after a while they returned and we were able to get our tea replenished. we also needed to get new cups as the tea left at the bottom of each cup had gone completely cold. we each ate 2 pastries and asked for the pieces of cake to be packed up so we could take them away. we were told that we could not do this due to health and safety!!! we then saw 2 boxes being taken to another table so when we were paying our bill i asked again, and also why some tables were able to get a takeaway. i was told that they had paid for additional pastries from the shop and that we could do that but we were unable to take the ones with us that were on our table. again it was explained to us that this is due to health and safety and the cakes in the shop containing more preservatives. the waiter also admitted that this made no sense but it was down to the decision of the chef. so our cakes just went to waste. we also saw that residents were treated differently to us being none residents. the residents were told that they could have the cakes taken to their room and also some additional sandwiches for their children!!! how is this possible with the lack of preservatives in the cakes i wonder!!! at a cost of 140 (inc service) i cannot believe that the savoy is not able to provide guests that cannot eat all their afternoon tea with the option of taking some home and would rather let food go to waste and be thrown away!! health and safety gone mad!!! maybe the chef should review his menu!!!!'''",0
London Guest House,"'''had the worst night in a hotel ever in my experience. small, uncomfortable bed. very noisy neighbouring room had tv on loud all night and did not turn it down until well after 03:00! complained to reception, who i heard ask someone if their tv was on - as if it was a friend / co-worker / family members room! also phones ringing in rooms and mobiles ringing loudly and repeatedly all night. doors slamming and creaking. far too noisy. terrible experience. not worth the reduced rate of 60 i paid for about 2 hours sleep! | shower was scalding and would not adjust temperature, and bathroom was tiny. had a noisy box refridgerator in the middle of the bedroom floor - at least i was pleased when the compressor kicked in as it downed out the noise of the neighbours! | the best thing about the whole experience was that the 266 bus route stops right outside and the flat screen freeview tv.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''never in my entire life have i walked out of a hotel until today. i did not even make it to the room. i hate writing negative reviews for hotels which are clearly capable of world class service as witnessed by the many other positive reviews but in this instance they failed. | on arrival the doorman welcomed us, took our bags and showed us into the room where check in was supposed to take place. there were three desks, only one of which was manned by a member of staff who was on the phone. we stood around embarrassed for a while and were ignored by a few members of staff so were made to feel very uncomfortable. eventually a male staff member invited us to take a seat at a desk and promptly disappeared. when he returned to start the check in process he had to check that our room was ready as the system was showing there was someone in it. it was now 18:00. unbelievable! | eventually he found our room keys and offered to take us there but first he gave us a show round. he pointed out what he called 'the american bar - the most famous bar in london!' fiona indicated that she needed a soft drink as we had been travelling all day. so we headed off to the american bar. another member of staff stood in our way and told us that the bar was busy and there was no place for us. he insisted we try the other bar called the beaufort bar. we had read about the american bar and really wanted to go there. so off we went to the beaufort bar. another disaster! we ordered two soft drinks and some bottled water. we got the drinks but no water. | next we headed off to our room but found a large queue of people waiting for the lift. a very brusque member of staff literally shooed them off up the stairs to what he called the blue lift. fiona asked him, very politely, if the blue lift was where we should also go. he was incredibly rude as he exasperated tutted at her and barked 'of course you should . you are on the 4th floor any old lift will do for you.' | the final straw! i had had enough! | never have i been made to feel more unwelcome in any hotel in the world. in about 30 minutes before even getting to my room the catalogue of rudeness, ignorance, disorganisation and downright poor customer service was just too much to take. | i handed back the room keys and walked out. i felt angry, embarrassed and humiliated. | i am sure this is not the norm. i would be horrified if it were. | however, savoy - you let us down very badly. shame on you for providing such a thoroughly unpleasant experience which so easily could have been avoided.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''we have stayed at the rembrandt hotel several times and although it has been updated (and it really needed to be), the rooms are quite small and the service is not great. the breakfast was poor and the servers were either overwhelmed with the number of people, or not great.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i have eaten at the grill many times but never stayed in the hotel before, so my partner bought us a weekend stay in a deluxe room as a present. when i rang to book the room i asked for a particular date and was informed it was unavailable, i pointed out that i was booking months in advance and had looked on websites showing the same rooms available to reserve. i was told that date 'was not available with a voucher' i was offered another date which i accepted at the inconvenience of cancelling another engagement. it seems obvious that once your loved one has purchased a voucher then they have your money and you are something of a captive audience, leaving them free to offer as much availability to new business as possible. this was not some cut price groupon or similar, this was a full price voucher purchased from the hotel itself. be warned, you may not get what you hope for. | having said all that, the hotel richly deserves its reputation. the public areas are wonderful and the service is second to none. breakfast was superb and the entertainment at the bars in the evening was lovely. the fixtures and fittings in the room were fine, though i have had much better in boutique hotels that cost a third of the price. the food in the grill was excellent but for the second time running i had to go and get the maitre'd after being left for a quarter of an hour, after that it was fine but you should not have to ask. overall it was a good experience but there are things that need ironing out.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''we travel a lot, and have stayed in many hotels, most nicer than this one, but this was a spur of the moment trip we took because of british air's great price for flights from washington to london. the hotel was paid for five nights through british air and we chose it because of its location, having stayed at the millennium gloucester hotel, which is close by. | we had several issues, such as the constant noise from traffic, a window being left open by the cleaning staff not discovered until we woke up to a very cold room, a panel in the ceiling falling open at one end, and lumpy beds, but only reported the panel, as it was a safety issue. | on the fourth night, a note was slipped under the door of our room, stating that our account had reached the hotel's limit, and the front office reception would appreciate it if we would settle the enclosed interim bill at our earliest convenience. mind you, our credit card had been swiped when we checked in and we have a rather good relationship with the bank, so i was sure that this was an error on their part, plus there was no bill included for us to know how much they were talking about. | the very next day, i spoke to the cashier who indicated that she was in charge, and discovered that they had not charged any fees to my credit card, and that i owed the princely sum of 253.56 pounds! thank god we did not eat all our meals there, or they would have been dunning me by day three. things got rather heated, and the cashier was causing eyebrows to raise, so we paid the bill in cash on the spot, and promised not to eat any more meals in the hotel, so as not to go over what ever limit they have. this spoiled the whole experience at this hotel, and we will never stay there again or recommend it to any one.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''we booked to stay at this hotel for a trip to london and the o2 arena, on arrival we were placed into an adjoining building which contained 4 flats, we stayed in flat 2, the place was absolutley disgusting and if you given this as your room i would avoid at all costs! | there was 1 bath towel per couple, 1 tea cup per room, 2 tv's but no remote, the bathrooms had an overpowering smell of sewage and was generally very unpleasant, it wad dirty, the decorating had not been finished, tiles were missing from the shower unit. | if you want a nice relaxing night this is not the place to stay, the sirens from the emergency vehicels went on all night, police, ambulance etc etc did not stop until 5am and then it only stopped for 10 minutes!! no sleep at all!! | to top it off after having no sleep i thought a quick shower to freshen me up........but no hot water, so we left. | i would avoid this hotel at all costs, it may be cheap but for the sake of an extra 20 i would definitely stay elsewhere!!'''",0
The Rembrandt,'''have fancied staying at the rembrandt for many years - perfect location after all. what a disappointment our room was probably the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in - there was not even anywhere to put our case so it had to stay on the floor and we fell over it several times and could not sit at the desk/dressing table without moving it. the bed was comfortable but that is about the best i can say. the room was really basic and unimaginative. the bathroom was two star at best. unhygenic shower curtain - my pet hate in supposedly four star hotels and a really cheap white plastic toilet seat. no toilet brush either! i had checked and was aware there was no parking available but for what it cost to park my fab jag for two days we could have stayed another night in many four star hotels in the city. breakfast was ok but nothing special and not much chioce - coffee was luke warm both mornings and on the second day we had to wait for a table - total disorganisation. the swimming pool and spa were quite nice but needed a good bleaching in places and again were at an extra costt although this is not clear on the website - or was not when i booked. i really wonder what other hotels some of the other reviewers have stayed in. i will not be returning to the rembrandt''',0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''walking past the hotel, i noted the magnificent old and stately building and took some pictures. then i decided to go in for a quick lunch. big mistake. i was sent to the bar where i ordered a simple sandwich. 40 minutes later after asking the waitress three times why the delay, i got up to walk out. the waitress said she would give it to me free if i waited. i did. even getting tea was forever, like ten minutes. the sandwich was very average, though i may have lost appetite. also, the decor was tacky, when i went downstairs for men's room the whole building seemed very badly designed. after four months in the flagship hotel in hongkong 25 years ago, an idyllic experience, this was catastrophic.'''",0
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",'''poor overall poor customer service. misleading regarding the rooms and we ended up paying for a js while staying in a very small size room. only interested in charging guests on arrival something i have never experienced with any hotel. very rude manager. did not understand the breakfast drama with a la carte. unacceptable. | will never stay there again. avoid them''',0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''hotel is resting on the laurels of the mandarin oriental's reputation. was in room 215. old, poorly decorated room that smelled of cigarette smoke. carpet was stained in multiple places. window looked out to a stairwell with construction equipment. workers arrived around 4am and their noise woke me up. had to call the front desk to get him to stop the noise. after all this, when i reported these issues at checkout the next morning, the only thing the manager offered was a discount on my next stay. needless to say, i will never use that discount.'''",0
Hartley Hotel,"'''the fact this was a budget room was ok with me i thought, as long as the bed was clean and it was but i have to say never ever again would i stay at this hell hole, we were only staying the one night thank god, i did not sleep all night, people banging doors, stomping up and down the corridor, shouting to one another and at one point it sounded like someone was trying to break a door down while shouting his head off, by four in the morning i was sat at the foot of the bed crying i was so tired, we left at seven did not even stay for breakfast, could not wait to get out. this is the first time i have ever written a review but i really feel the need to warn others.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''this really is a disappointing hotel. | i can see how it might be impressive to someone who is used to staying at travelodge and if i had paid 50 a night to stay at the mandarin i might have been impressed too. however, i do not think it is unreasonable to expect value for money. that does not mean i am not prepared to spend money on a decent room, it means guests should get what they pay for. | i suspect that some guests feel they are getting their 500 worth simply because they have been permitted to stay in a 'posh hotel' but if you pay ten times what you would pay at a travelodge you should expect ten times the value. | when i stay in a budget hotel i accept that i should only expect basic facilities, decor and services. the standard of accommodation at this particular mandarin is no better than an average 3-4 star hotel. the rooms are tired, grubby and old fashioned. the staff is poorly trained (or poorly motivated) and the facilities are not what are generally considered to be 5 star. | if you are not used to staying in 5 star accommodation you may think the mandarin hyde park is impressive. trust me, its not 5 star. i would advise anyone who is thinking of staying here to either save their money and stay in a budget hotel or spend the same amount on a different 5 star hotel. you may not be used to staying in 5 star accommodation but that is no reason to accept less than 5 star service - one persons money is as good as the next. if you do not require that extra special something that should be provided in all 5 star hotels you may as well stay at one of the many 4 star hotels in central london. and if you do require that extra special something that should be provided in all 5 star hotels you will be disappointed by the mandarin hyde park.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''perhaps it was too much expeced - my nona always talked about the savoy like it was a very special place. when we planned to visit london we of corse booked this hotel. we found a good price on the internet and really looked forward to this weekend. we had not a to happy time. the room looked into roofs and the people working here was nice but not all. going to the american bar before going for out dinner we as guest of hotel had no table and have to wait for more than half hour. the drinks we get served were just normal drinks and very expensive and the service slow. on breakfast we had to wait again and was very normal and expensive again. the next day we walked to the restaurante on the main road and had breakfast there. i was sad as i had not the dreams of my nona fulfiled. london was very nice, so much to see and to do but we have to go back to do it again sad not at savoy but another hotel.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here for two nights during a business trip in room 453. room ok - tattered carpeting, beat up woodwork and frayed bathrobe aside, once i called the general manager's office (after three calls with no response to hotel front desk) to get the tv and in room safe fixed. also front desk gave me a key that never worked in the first place. request to have contents removed from mini bar was never responded to. | towels were brand new (never washed) so ended up covered with white lint for two days - thankfully my business associates had a sense of humor. meals - buffet breakfast competent, but lounge area meals were dull and service was appalling. eastern european waiter's reply was a soviet-surly ""i have no idea"" regarding availability of wines, cider and how the fish and chips dish was. the bar man stood in plain view of guests picking his nose and his teeth - gross. requests for towels that had been washed and extra toilet paper were met with rolls placed on bathroom counter (i had to install them myself, and towels placed on side of tub, with dirty towels on floor left there in place. | only bright spot were concierge team members who were harried but at least helpful regarding maps, directions, etc. | to sum it up - even the location cannot overcome sullen, uncaring staff to justify the prices. stay over at the thistle charring cross instead and take the bus/tube where you are going (three tube lines underneath). | f&amp;b - the moti mahal has good and reasonable indian a few blocks away toward the south kensington tube stop on glendowner place. great lamb bhuna, rice, poppa dums and a lager for under 20 pounds for dinner.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''service, service, service! that is something the elegant, prestigious, famed savoy knows nothing about. it truly is a beautiful historic hotel, but it is too bad that the people think they are doing you a favour by letting you stay there. from the very beginning, they do not tell you what their address is. because if you do not know where the ""strand"" is in london, you just are not good enough to be there. i got lost finding it because even a londoner gave me the wrong directions. | the bathrooms are moderm but of old-world design. it is great to simply soak in the big tubs after a long day. | but customer service leaves much to be desired. i was charged a higher rate than what my travel agent had booked. i was given someone else's bill for express check-out. i was billed for a paper that i did not want. and then they have the nerve to add on a ""discretionary service charge"" - a tip - without my asking. the staff that i encountered was snotty when i pointed out a mistake in my bill. they are so sure of their righteousness. they are living in the past.'''",0
City View Hotel,"'''rooms are nasty and poorly maintained. staff it negligent. tenants are sketchy. i actually got locked out at night in the middle of winter while the door man was away, then was woken up in the morning by a fire alarm. staff could not have cared less. stay anywhere else.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we visited the hotel for two nights on both nights we where not allowed in the bars and could sit outside and get room service only, to add insult to injury after not getting two girls walked straight in from outside clearly friends of the guy who stopped us. | after one coffee at breakfast we where told we would have to pay 4.00 for a second one just felt like every opportunity to take money off guests. | very disappointing would not stay again or recommend to friends.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''cannot tell you how disappointed we were with the room we stayed in on 1st november. superior double - i do not think so. having voiced our concerns we were offered a room of similar dimensions. the room was so small with the bed tucked against the wall it felt like staying in a caravan. it took brute force to pull out the duvet from the side against the wall. room service had the tiniest table to set down our order and there was only one chair to sit at so my partner had to sit on the bed. the general manager told us he had no other rooms available but did not offer an form of compensation. on checking out the receptionist asked if we had slept well, when i told her we had not she said they may offer us a complimentary upgrade next time we visited. we had looked forward to this special evening and were thoroughly disappointed.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed for 3 days in the week before the olympics. after weeks of wet cold weather it happened to be sunny with the temperature in the high 20s - and this hotel really could not cope! | my room (530) was stiffling and unpleasant to return to. the window opened on to a smelly dirty stairwell (photo uploaded) and was useless for providing ventilation. there was an old secondary air conditioning unit which helped very little. i guess by putting my face 15cm directly over it i could detect some cold air but that was it. | the room was laughingly called ""executive"" - there was nothing ""executive"" about it apart from the fact it was somewhat bigger than the non-executive rooms; unfortunately bigger also meant the aircon was less likely to help. | i did not think these out of date dinosaurs of a hotel still existed. excessive carpets, now showing wear. general air of shabbiness. no need to use the spa next door: if you want a sauna just ride the lifts. | the only positive points were the location and the breakfast down stairs. also this hotel was available with substantial discount via late rooms - even so i still felt i was paying too much. | all in all an ordeal.'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''the room was fine the first night but when i tried to extend the following day, the receptionist rudely rejected my friends a room then whilst showing me a single room, tried to insist i take a shower and have sex with him!!! if that was not bad enough, when you tried to leave he locked my luggage in a cupboard, so i made my way to leave and he kept following me the whole time asking questions of a sexual nature, all the way across the next street! he made me feel so afraid and disgusted. id warn any woman thinking of staying here, be careful!

Newham Hotel,"'''booked a double room, however when i turned up and the receptionist noticed there would be two girls in one bed he then asked if we wanted a twin room. this was understandable to an extent, but we politely asked if we could keep what we booked. he then looked down and said 'actually we have a shortage of double rooms'. after asking why we could book that room, we were then told the booking did not reach them ?? this was a blatant lie as he got our details straight away. next he said his preferance was two girls and two boys go in twin rooms. we said okay, we will have the twin. this was then retracted and the excuse was the shortage of double beds again. we were put into a twin, and as we left to go out we were asked if the room was okay, and would we want a double ??? after much deliberation, it was clear that this was the fact that two girls were sharing the room. | the room was freezing, and even after asking someone to check our radiators nothing was done, the bathroom smelled of sewers, and the shower constantly bubbled.

The Savoy,"'''i am a member of fairmont hotels and i have always regarded the savoy, mostly due to my love for oscar wilde, as the hotel to be in london. last november i was eager to see how the restoration had turned out so we went for tea with some friends. we found it ok but somehow lacking in charm. what we found really disappointing was the very poor service (it took us half an hour to convince the waiter to bring vegetarian sandwiches!) and the mediocre quality of food and tea. | i thought that it might be because they had just opened and i decided to give it a second chance so we went back for lunch during our recent stay in london. | on monday april 11 at twelve of the clock we walked into the hotel really, really hoping they would change my opinion. | we walked in the american bar and i was told to leave as i was wearing trainers! | my prada shoes!!!! trainers???? | would oscar wlde and aubrey beardsley be refused entrance as well for being too eccentrically dressed? | more amused than angry - their loss not ours!- we went back to our favorite bar at the claridge's where we had a great lunch, excellent service and atmosphere, surrounded by top executives in sneakers! | the bar there was fully booked, the american bar at the savoy was empty but for a table. you do the math! | is the savoy there for business or retro attitude? what a pity!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed 6 days in the hotel, and the a/c broke down in day 2 and never was repaired. the staff got inside my room at 9 of the clock on the day i was supposed to check out when i was sleeping for no reason. also when i put up the do not disturb note on the door, they call my room because the housekeeping wants to finish off their work as soon as possible which i do not understand why?!?!? after all i spoke to the duty manager and she just offered me a drink which i refused. then when i was checking out they said they gave me 31 discount!!!!!! and by the way i paid over 1200 for the stay! then i asked to speak to the head manager who refused to talk to me saying that she is in a ""meeting""! | my advice, avoid this hotel and never accept little compensations because you will not be able to complain to the authorities in uk who can get you what you really deserve from any hotel in the country. |'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''lobby - underwhelming. no grand entrance or wow factor. it felt very dated and lacked any charm. | food - we dined in the grill one night, the ambiance was good but the food was poor. f&amp;b manager informed &amp; apologised. did not seem sincere. | service - varied. front desk staff were very attentive but on checkout was not asked how my stay was which was surprising. | spa - treatment very good. relaxation room was decorated nicely but all the chairs were so uncomfortable. | if you do not want to hear cars roaring all night, please ask for a room that does not face onto the park.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''booked a two night stay as a treat for my elderly mum and me so splashed out a bit on the hotel. i have stayed in much nicer hotels for far less money before. the hotel itself is nice enough and the location is lovely, however, the staff did not go out of their way to make our stay pleasant at all. concierge/porter did not help us out of the taxi when we arrived and we were never greeted by staff in the foyer during our stay. we were not offered help to take our luggage at all. the staff seemed to be very preoccupied with wealthy guest with oddles of luggage and completely ignored me and mum. this was also the case in the pool area - i was not shown around at all, however, a guest who arrived 10 minutes after me got a guided tour. you pay extra to use the pool and gym. breakfast was mediocre - bacon and sausages were hard and cold both days. i felt there were double standards from many of the staff not what i expected from a 4 star hotel. i would not stay here again.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''had an amazing dinner here tonight in the savoy grill (which is not actually part of the savoy). service in the american bar was shocking though. the bar was half empty, no need to pack people in like sardines! not a special experience. even worse, doorman put us in a taxi (and he clearly knew the driver). we were charged 4 before even leaving the building, then dumped on the opposite side of our hotel and subjected to a tirade of verbal abuse for not paying a tip! disgraceful! will stick to ritz next time. sort yourself out savoy!'''",0
Hartley Hotel,"'''extremely basic shared facilities. the accommodation also provides sleeping arrangements for those who are homeless and other such sorts. the rooms stink of smoke. the double beds were small doubles although the room was cleaned it still stunk. the cleaned the corridors at 7am on a saturday morning and people are constantly arguing and walking up and down and hovering in doors ways all night. this place is not nice, the area is not safe unless you like cars pulling over shouting at you i would avoid this hotel especially at 60 plus per night when others are clearly staying there on the council for free.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i arranged for my high profile guest to stay here because of our estate's history with the establishment. unfortunately, a company called sarova has taken it over and has become difficult in customer service. my guest had difficulty ordering a car or having charges put on the account, and even though my credit card was paying it, they refused to give me a copy of the charges for the privacy of my guest, which made no sense! at one point they tried to charge my guest and she had to call me which is outrageous! the suite was clean, spacious and beautiful, and the location is ideal. however, after a very public event, we retired to my guest's room to order tea service for 6 people. much of the staff is foreign, had some difficulty communicating, and had no clue what my guest was ordering. i had to take over the phone call downstairs and place the order. this is not the level of service i expected for a hotel of their caliber. i do hope it was a fluke and would give this place another chance, but for the money being paid, it should have been a hassle-free experience. | pros: great location, great accommodations. | cons: difficult communication.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''just returned from a long weekend break at the rembrandt. we chose the hotel for it is location, it is great to be so close to the museums, and it is easy transfer fromkings cross via the picadilly line underground. i would suggest using the knightsbridge stop rather than south kensington, the walk underground at south kensington feels as if you have almost walked as far as harrods and there are more stairs there too | having received an email two days before arriving to upgrade from executive to club room at a special offer of just 10 per night extra, i agreed to the offer, and also emailed the hotel asking for information about having a bottle of wine and chocolates in the room on arrival as it was an anniversary weekend. | well, the email regarding wine was replied to while we were on the train that morning, far too late for me to do anything about, and having not had a reply had made my own arrangements. | on arrival we were told it was not 30 extra in total but 30 per night for the upgrade and i was too embarrassed to argue in a busy reception. i did check when i reached the room though, and the email confirmed i was right. we returned to reception and was only greeted with a request for 'evidence' and then 'i have put it right' which constituted for an apology i assume, as no apology was given, despite the fact i was nearly ripped of by 60. | i know most people staying here are not on a budget, but be aware they will take 50 refundable deposit on your card, i have not experienced that in four star hotels in london before | the room was fine, decent size but nothing special, the cleaning ladies were very good and really pleasant. double glazing was very effective though, as were the thick curtains so experienced a good nights sleep | reception staff on the whole could be split, the men (jean louis for example) were very polite, the women much less so. | breakfast is a standard buffet affair, nice quality and staff in the main attentive | we paid extra for passes to the spa. the staff there were really friendly and helpful, however, be aware that swimming lessons are held sat &amp; sun til 2pm, so only part of the pool is available, and parents are sat (with shoes on) by the poolside so was not the greatest environment to relax. also, we had not realised the sauna and steam room are single sex, again, no use if you want to chat to your partner. | overall while decent standard accommodation, i have had better treatment at cheaper establishments such as travelodge at covent garden (and bigger rooms) and we will probably not return'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''upon spending 300 for a night here, i was expecting a wonderfully relaxing stay. | i knew that was not going to happen when a letchy check-in boy from eastern europe showed us to our room and showed us a bedroom, a bathroom and er, is there anything else sir? urr, no, why, should there be? okay, it is a bedroom and er, yes, so it is, it is a bathroom. | of course, he was hanging around like a bad smell for his ahem, tip and he was not half brazen about it. | the tip culture really ruined this hotel for me and my wife. it was really in your face and blatent. you could not break wind without someone hinting heavily for a tip. | the porter came to take our bags and pointed loudely to the number of bags, repeating the number of bags that were on his trolley. i would not mind but i put most of them on his trolley in the first place! | to get out of the hotel cost me 30 in tips! 10 for the porter, 10 for the maids (who i insist on tipping because they do all the work and get the least credit whilst the mini-bar letchers are rolling in it), and 10 for the guy who got my car (the car parking having cost me 50 for parking there for about 12 hours!). | we went to the restaurant early because we had a baby with us. that was fine until the stuffy clientele made us feel like we were sat there with two heads. the helpful manager having sat us down in the corner and then despite a large empty restaurant, put a romancing couple directly next to us. | the food was from the chinese place, tiger something maybe? food was at best, below average and the atmosphere very stuffy. would not recommend it. | i would love this place if it were more child friendly, staff who are friendly because they are actually pleasant people rather than fighting to please you for a big tip (most of whom looked scared to loosen up a bit in case of ""the frown"". | my best advice would be stay here, enjoy it and do not give them letches tips.'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''we had tea on sunday afternoon at the dorchester. it was embarassingly bad, really, truly, appalling. basil faulty could not have done better! | i was especially upset as it had been my idea. i have stayed many times at the dorchester's sister hotels for business, mainly the principe, in milan. i have always found it a delight. a respite from mindless business travel with a wonderful friendly staff. it has gorgeous big old fashioned rooms and a truly awesome spa and pool on the top floor. however, even with the fabulous surrondings, it is, to my mind, the staff that make the difference between a good and a great hotel. | the dorchester obviously does not believe this. | the staff are arrogant, unpleasant and unhelpful. a previous reviewer put it very well when he said, that the staff regard the guests as a bother. i would concur with this completely. | at tea, we were treated as a bunch of annoying idiots. who were bothering the staff. imagine, we were so spoilt, we wanted our tea to be served! at nearly 40+ per person for tea, you would have hoped they might make a small effort... do not count on it. you are upsetting their afternoon by being there. that is how they make you feel. | after a few glasses of champagne, we asked for our tea to be served. we would have liked our sandwiches to be brought to the table at roughly the same time as the tea, not when the tea was cold. that did not happen. when we asked for hot tea we were told it was on its way. by the third time of trying to get some more tea we had to get up and ask the gentleman/manager at the service stand to bring it. | we ordered water, again it never appeared. i had to get up, physically stand infront of a waiter and ask for it. guess what? yup, it never appeared. the trick is to ask for everything three times, and then it arrives. but actually the really clever bit is finding someone to ask three times! elusive is obviously a word they learn quickly! | when we asked for scones they arrived. we had only asked once! hurray, it was a blip in the service. it was all going to be fine. well....no. the scones arrived warm and wrapped in a lovely white linen napkin. sadly by the time the butter, cream and jam arrived, the scones were cold. | the finaly insult was when we tried to pay. the bill arrived very very promptly. i duly handed over my switch card to pay. the man came back and informed everyone at the table, that my card was not acceptable - they do not take solo cards. i pointed out it was a switch card. he went away. he then came back in a loud voice informed us all that it had not been authorised. (i got home and checked my balance online, i had not been wippped out overnight!) so very unlikely, but i am too old and have stayed in too many hotels, to be bothered by this stuff. technology cannot always be relied on. | so i handed over my visa card. he swiped it, returned the slip for signing. then he returned, again, he said my card had not been authorised. deja vu! even though the slip i had in my hand had an authorisation code on it, he said it was not authorised. | i just wanted to leave at this point. he became a bit belligerent and annoying and just keep repeating loudly that my card had not been authorised. i asked for my signed slip back, and gave him cash. they would not give me a cash receipt, i even asked him to sign a piece of paper saying he had said received 50 in cash. he would not. | guess what? yup. i had paid twice, i paid cash, and my visa card has indeed been charged. at the time of writing, i cannot be 100% sure they have not charged my switch card as well, as my bank inform me it can take up to 3/4 days for debits to go through. | i have spend a whole morning sorting out a payment for a small amount of money. i have eventually contacted the hotel, g.m., (general manager) and he assures me they are sorting it out. he has, in their defence, been charming, and as good as his word. he has phoned me back, and assures me not only that my card has been credited, but they are crediting me with the cash i paid. so i may, have ended up not paying at all. | however, i still feel, it should not have happened in the first place. and when i called yesterday to sort it out, the food and beverage manager should have taken care of it. they did not. hence i bounced it up the gm. (go to the top if there is a problem!) | my advice. go somewhere else. claridge's is fabulous for tea. the staff are friendly, courteous and charming. sadly the dorchester, even with a charming gm, does not deserve our hard earned cash.'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''i arrived and was checked into the dorchester with great service. everything after that was poor. when i put a ""do not disturb"" sign out, i was surprised to see an employee knocking on the door. that would never happen elsewhere. then the front desk called my room and hung up at night. i called back and they knew nothing of what i was saying. when i explained the phone said where the call was from and that i was not making this up, they were flippant. when my breakfast was delivered to my room on the second day of a four day stay he actually had the guts to call me out and complain that i did not answer the door when he knocked. i then explained i had the ""do not disturb"" sign out because i took and bath and needed a nap after the long flight and no sleep. all of which i had already explained to the front desk. | i had to leave very early in the morning so i left a comment card at the front desk, which i doubt made it to the general manager. so i wrote a letter, not an email but an actual letter. | the other thing that bothered me was the staff kept referring to me as mr. &amp; mrs. when i made my reservations i filled out as ms. i had to remind them time and time again i am not a mrs. or a mr. for that fact. i am a single female traveler. i think the only way you will get stellar treatment is be a movie star and not just an ordinary girl. the only good thing was the location. i did get a call after they got my letter. they left a message for ""either mr. or mrs....."" | at this point i give up.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''the savoy let themselves down badly | we chose the savoy because we enjoyed staying at claridges during our last family trip to london and hoped that with the benefit of the extensive refurbishment, the savoy might be even better. | nevertheless, as a regular traveller - uk and abroad - staying in a variety of hotels, i believe that over the years i have developed realistic expectations. | i appreciate that the savoy is supposed to be a premium 5 star hotel but a large london hotel is still a large london hotel and with so many guests there are bound to be the odd occasions when things go wrong. | unfortunately for myself and my family, during our recent stay, the savoy got pretty well everything they could, wrong. | the trip started well enough when my family and i arrived late tuesday morning to drop off our bags before taking my son sightseeing. the doorman took charge of the bags with minimal fuss and escorted us through to a very helpful young lady in reception who gave us a brief overview of the hotel. | it had been some years since my last visit to the savoy but i could tell immediately that the communal areas had really benefited from the refurbishment. the restrooms were a joy to use with courteous attendants. | the young lady offered to check if the two adjoining rooms i had booked were already available but i declined saying that would return around 2pm - the official check-in time. | when we returned it was more like 3pm and we were astonished to be informed that neither room was ready. after about 10 minutes of embarrassed apologies a young man on reception said one of the rooms was now available and we were escorted up to the 4th floor. | we were promised our bags would be brought straight up but after a quarter of an hour wait a porter arrived with the wrong bags. 10 minutes later another member of staff turned up with the correct bags and proceeded to ask if we had everything we wanted. i pointed out that we were still waiting for the second room to be available. i was further disappointed when i realised they had not even started to service it. | as it had now gone 3.30pm and we needed to go out, i stressed that the room must be ready for our return and pointed out that the connecting door needed to be unlocked and opened so that we could have access to my sons room, once they had finished preparing it. | returning well after 5pm it was annoying to find that we were still unable to access the adjoining room and i reported this immediately to reception by telephone. within 10 minutes two members off staff came up and let themselves in to the adjoining room and shouted through the closed connecting door that it was now unlocked. it was not and i had to leave my room and chase after them down the corridor and fetch them back. after a few minutes wrestling on both sides of the connecting door they managed to open it and agreed it was defective the solution being that we wedge the door open all night to make sure it did not get stuck. this was certainly not ideal given that the occupant was a child. at this point i suggested it might be an idea to have a key card for the main entrance door of the adjoining room in case we needed to gain access to our child that way. why they did not provide key cards for both rooms initially i do not know but to be fair, one of the members of staff did return after a few minutes with a key for the adjoining room. | so, just before 6pm we finally had access to the rooms we had booked. if we had a schedule to stick to, such as show tickets or dinner reservations, then these extensive delays in making our rooms available would have caused even greater inconvenience. | after all the problems, my wife and i felt like a glass of wine while we washed and changed. unfortunately the robes provided are far from generous. whilst just suitable for my averaged sized wife, the robe was simply inadequate for me. if you are either over 6 feet tall as i am or i guess 15 stone, you will need to bring your own. consequently, room service was out, unless one of us was going to delay getting ready so as to be suitably dressed to answer the door. | as an alternative i tried the mini bar. this had two half bottles of white wine. we had the chablis, which was ok. the alternative was an unappealing sauvignon blanc. so we drank our one small glass of wine each while we got ready and decided that, as it was still early evening we would go for a pre-dinner drink. | the american bar promotes a range of non-alcoholic cocktails which looked ideal for our son, so we decided to give this a try. | if there is a dress code the majority of other guests, who admittedly appeared to be from the us or far east (where they sensibly take a more practical view) were clearly not aware of it, so we assumed it would be no problem for our son, who looked smart and appeared to be a quiet and well behaved 13 year old, to accompany us. unfortunately, i was informed by a member of staff in the thames foyer that we could not have a pre-dinner drink as under18s are not permitted in any of the bar areas of the hotel! i cannot believe that a hotel of this standard is so unwelcoming to families. the hotel information booklets and website clearly state opening times, etc of restaurants and bars, but there is no mention of this key issue of age restrictions. | we could have gone directly into dinner at the river restaurant, i guess, but it really was too early and the fact that, after everything else that had happened and the savoy now apparently having no provision for under 18s being able to join their parents for a pre-dinner drink, just made me want to leave as soon as possible. as it turns out we had a most enjoyable evening away from the savoy, stopping off at covent garden before heading further afield to a very nice japanese restaurant i know. | back in the room the next morning, we realised that although pleasantly furnished with a vestibule and good sized bathrooms, the rooms themselves are small and lacking in the little touches you would expect wi fi internet is chargeable and you have to keep signing in every time you go back to the room. also: no tissues in bedroom; no clock visible from the bed; no comfortable chair(s) etc. | certainly there is nowhere for two guests to take breakfast comfortably, so we were left with no real choice other than to get up earlier than planned and head down to the river restaurant. | i must say the room was lovely and the service was attentive. the breakfast on the other hand was lacking- not at all what it once was. for some reason there were black bits on all the crust edges of the toast and the mushrooms and tomato were watery and unpleasant tasting. the bacon and sausage were fine and the eggs came pretty much as ordered though. the tea was fine too. | so in summary, there are a few things missing in terms of guest comfort and convenience which really is unfortunate in a premium 5 star (we paid 700 per night) establishment. | the inability to make rooms available on time and to make simple things like connecting doors open or even the correct luggage appear, are frankly unforgivable. | and, being unable to provide a family of guests with the means to have a pre-dinner drink is simply uncivilised!'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''i thought i must give a review about this hotel as it was so disgusting . we booked a night here in july as my son and friend were going to see mumford and sons at olympic park. the location for this hotel was excellent.when we checked in the guy behind the counter took us to a building next door to the hotel ( must be part of it ) and led us up some steps to the room. it was very small, a multi bulb light on the ceiling with only one bulb working and exposed electrical wiring , wallpaper pealing off from both walls and ceiling , no wordrobe , no tv remote , and it stank of cigarettes . | we stayed for 30 minutes and checked out.'''",0

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''with the price they charged, is way-overvalued, over-rated.. | i stay in deluxe for 4 consecutive nights just the past week, the only 2 good i could highlight is room make-up staff and the f&amp;b restaurant's staff. | but their concierge, do not expect you can call them once you are outside the hotel, 2 occasions when i was outside trying to call concierge to amend restaurant reservation time. no one @ concierge picked my call. one time i tried calling 4 times no one picked, and hotel operator tried to connect twice also not successful. i am a traveler from asia and wasted my roaming charges on my phone. another case was when i was in room, asked them to make a reservation of a restaurant, they said will call back, but half hour after i called them back, the concierge said no one had my instruction, i was astonished what kind of service is this when you are being charged with a palace service rating price per night at corinthia but they provide you service worst than what you could think of. what is wrong????? before i went london, i was at paris, staying with le royal monceau, their consierge service is like heaven (true palace rating), while corinthia.... vice versa. because of this, i dare not to ask any shops i visited in london to send merchandises to corinthia, i am not even sure if anyone will take care of my stuff. | restaurant, nicely decorated with most part of the hotel, staff as mentioned great, but the breakfast buffet disappointing because is not providing a full english breakfast.... even you have nice waffles / berries does not help at all.... big buffet table but makes me felt use ""less""... | security, perhaps the hotel has high hope on its hidden camera or no ones dare to commit any bad things in the building, but no staff or anyone attending at the other side of the door facing charing cross station. one night when myself and my wife came back taking elevator at the r level which is the lowest level on the concierge floor. 2 suspicious men were in the elevator claiming the elevator was going down, they do not look like hotel guests to me due to their unfamiliarity to the elevator. i felt a bit unsafe given the complex is so big. fortunate my room is near the elevators, but if you live farther away the corridor and if you know non-hotel guests could walk around the premises this feeling is not good. | in all, even the hotel sales tell me how much the owner of the group spent hundred millions pounds on renovating this. with such service, i doubt how far can this business model maintains. perhaps over-pricing us the customers helped them to survive another day. i am not sure if they provide corporate rate for its corporate customers, but personal stay, i say ""beware"" &amp; ""stay away""!'''",0

The Rembrandt,'''there are so many good hotels in london that there is really no reason to stay at a hotel that so blatantly cares nothing for its guests. the worst customer service you could wish for plus dated and unattractive dcor and a poor breakfast is what you will get for your money. not only would i never stay here again i really regret ever making the reservation. don`t make the same mistake!''',0
The Lanesborough,'''yes its a grand building and central and yet for all the money spent on it there is something lacking. | its as though the only stylish areas are the lobby and the library bar. everything else looks false but for sure the service is good and the staff are lovely. it should be an oasis being a stones throw from hyde park but its not and it feels more clinically business oriented than for a stay | it looks expensive and is expensive and its hard to feel you can relax and its way better to eat out and enjoy london | given as you walk out of the entrance you are possibly walking into one of the most congested road junctions in london its hard not to notice the pollution. could you do better for less? unfortunately yes and also feel a lot mre comfortable''',0

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my friend took the private room here last night for twenty people spending multiple thousands as a treat for his husbands 50th. he is and was incredibly polite, chose superb wines yet was treated poorly throughout the night by supercilious and rude staff. open and offhand patronising comments littered the evening. he did not complain as he is too nice and did not want to spoil his husbands night but the evening was capped off by him not being allowed to take us to the half empty bar at 11pm as we were too big a party and we had to wait in the lobby. never going back.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''it is so sad when you visit an old rich, aristocratic friend who is now struggling to keep the air of class and dignity. the hotel is packed with russians and middle eastern and is for those kind of new money bearers that the staff is focused to render their services. that explains why everything is over offered and over rated as well. for instance: i was appalled when keeping a non disturb sign hanging at my door a cleaning lady knocked to see if everything was fine. when i lived in london, many years ago, i always dreamed in staying by the dorchester, for its class, location and atmosphere. the dream turned to be a nightmare. never have i felt so bad treated in my life. more than that, i felt like woody woodpecker when any predator look at him like roasted chicken turning over the fire. the young men of the concierge are a case apart. they were quite rude, impolite, useless and not at all attentive, since everything they could offer seemed to be a form to take the highest value from the hotel guests pockets. for instance, transportation to heathrow airport was 148 pounds!! and they said that as the best value for money. if you dare to say transportation could range from 45 (in mini-cabs) to 70 (in londons black taxis) they would give you that kind of look that a seller of a shop in rodeo drive once gave to julia roberts in the movie lady in red. nevertheless they are probably from low english working class or from eastern countries drowning in the lack of employment of the european crisis, they behave like they are better than their guests. perhaps because the big tips comes from russians and middle eastern as mentioned, people from other nationalities and countries were completely ignored. you pay much and get low. there are many other hotels in that area. do not be fooled, your old aristocratic rich friend is now running a different kind of job, not pleasant, not classy, but expensive.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed for several days last summer. the property was fine, and the location great, but we were intensely dissatisfied with the service. on checking out, we found a charge of over 33 pounds (!) for a 13 minute call to a local mobile phone. the hotel manager told us that the card in our room warned us calls to mobiles might be very expensive, and would go no farther than to reduce the charge by half-- still around $30 for a short local call!! as it turned out, the card in the room said 1 pound is typical for a 3 minute local call, and said nothing about higher rates for calls to mobile phones. | the moral: even in these days of nearly free phone calls, hotel calls can still be unbelievably expensive, and if you are staying at the rembrandt, do not expect to be treated honestly or fairly about the charges!'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''turned up after booking online . were told by gite the manager that he had tried to contact us saying that the two en suite rooms we had booked were now only one lying b****r ,the other was a room only with shared facilities .bedroom small ,bathroom flooded . breakfast poor eastern european waitress,s grumpy. avoid unless nothing else available'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i recently returned to the savoy to stay the night and have dinner the next evening in the grill room. the bedroom was tiny for 650 per night, the bathroom very old fashioned, not what i expected after a multi million pound refurb. the room was very noisy throughout the night. i had to check out the next morning and was then out for most of the day. i had to change for dinner in the ladies loo, most hotels offer slightly better facility for changing in if you have already had to check out of the room. dinner was no better, the grill room was so cramped, it was ridiculous, because the staff could not get to the tables easily, a lady on the table next to us had her drink spelled all over her. my food was so disappointing i could not believe it. table had been booked for 6pm and i had a car collecting us at 9pm. at 8pm we were asked to leave the table as they needed it back for another booking. had i been told about this when i booked, i would not have minded but i was not told so we ordered another drink and sat there for another hour. breakfast was also a huge disappointment. i used to go to the savoy, for dinner/lunch/to stay the night/parties very regularly but i will not be returning any time soon, it was incredibly disappointing.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''went to the american bar for pre-theatre cocktails with friends and very disappointed with the service. the cocktails were fab but it was a struggle to get anyone to serve, more than once i was reduced to waving, in order to get a member of staff to the table. it is a great shame that my first time back after the re-opening was such a let down. i will not be going back as the are too many other great places that are interested in providing a true 5 star service.'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''this hotel has the possibility to be excellent and 3 star except for the infestation of mice it appears to have currently (feb 2016), which is a real shame. stayed for 3 nights. staff friendly and helpful, cooked breakfast and buffet is help-yourself and beautifully cooked. could not fault the food. family rooms are a good size and bathrooms good, both have nice decor, clean beds/bedding, good mattresses and bathrooms clean and well appointed. | frankly the hotel decor is significantly let down by a diy approach to repairs and decorating e.g. nice wallpaper in rooms but poorly put up with cuts in the wrong places/patches and someone went crazy in the shower with a mastic gun! frankly this seriously detracts from nice fixture and fittings choices/room designs. room 20 had such a poorly fitted double glazed window the awful wind sounded like a demented owl who-wooing all one stormy night! kept us up most of the night. as i said, there was mice in room 20 and room 13, which they would moved us to! if you can ignore that, the hotel is on a main road around the corner from a tube station and on a bus route. mcdonalds almost opposite and plenty of shops/places to eat around locally. road can be a bit noisy but not exactly a country-side location so expected!'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed at the mandarin for one night because wonderful the lanesbourough (where i stayed for 5 nights, see my review) | was completely oversold for the add'l night i requested.. | the mandarin was ""created"" from the old, doudy hyde park hotel, and it shows.... the executive room booked was of decent size, good lighting, but had no enclosed shower (but great water pressure!) and came with paper fax, internet outlets, good stereo/cd and excellent wide-screen tv (with the most terrible remote i have ever seen - you really need a guide to figure out, no matter if you are a true techie like me). room overall was ok, but not up to mandarin's quality standards in other properties, and during the night a light blew out that also shut down the entire rooms power, taking about 45 mins for a staff electrician to fix in the middle of the night. | the real reason i would *never* return to this hotel is the dressed-down, ""thug like"" street rappers with their horribly dressed entourages hanging/partying constantly in the hallways and lobby throughout the hotel - i thought this might be a freak thing, but after talking to both the doorman and the limo driver, apparently the hotel is marketing itself to the london ""music"" crowd, and this type of crowd is the standard now, not the exception - and it really shows - the only refuge from this less than desirable crowd was in the popular ""mandarin bar"", which i think most of the hotel's elite was hanging out in an attempt to separate themselves from the rest of these folks.... | all on all, when i travel to london, and stay with a top hotel chain with the reputation of the mandarin group, i except to dress well and enjoy the good life, and not hang out with the partied-out ""p. diddy"" crowd.. | advise: avoid at all costs unless you are into hanging with the rap and hip-hop crowd 24/7.'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''plus: the main advantage is the cheap price hotel, omething hard to find in london. good for ""only sleeping hotel"". close to the train station (acton town). some shops nearby, pretty small but with plenty of food. friendly staff. | minus: small room, very small bathroom. breakfast too light. you can easily hear other people in the next room (damn sure they can hear you). very few sockets.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''we booked this hotel for an overnight stay in london. when we checked in we were asked to pay for our room straight away, which we found very strange. normally hotels take your credit card and record it for payment and the bill is then settled when you check out. we stayed in room 347 the noise from other guests walking and talking in the corridor could be clearly heard in our room, lots of slamming doors added to this made for an uncomfortable stay. the sound proofing within the hotel is obviously not adequate. on sunday morning room service knocked on the door to clean the room at 9.30am!! breakfast on the sunday morning was horrendous, the dining area is set up with tables so close together you are almost sat shoulder to shoulder with other guests staying in the hotel. all in all a horrible experience.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''considering the rembrandt is in the ""royal borough"" of chelsea and kensington, which is a beautiful and convinent location, there was absolutely nothing royal about my stay. my room which i was sharing with a friend was small and distastefully appointed. the staff were not welcoming, unhelpful and out-rightly rude. i felt like i was being ""watched"". the breakfast buffet is lovely there so drowned my sorrows in a bucket of hash browns and tea.'''",0

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''was not an enormous fan of the ridgemount ... rooms are small and dated. i tend not to spend a lot of time in my room, but even just to collapse in, i felt a bit wedged in. sheets, mattresses and furnishings worn and questionably clean (holes and thread-bare). for the same price, you can get larger more comfortable rooms further out from the centre. | while very close to the british museum (and around), you are taking the tube or the bus nearly anywhere else ... if you are doing that, stay further out of the city where there is more quiet and better value. | breakfast is acceptable. if nothing else it takes the guessing games out of your morning. | staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful.'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''very disappointed after number of very pleasant stays at bangkok mandarin, to find london mandarin so poor. junior suite was small, a complimentary upgrade to 'presidential suite' is making very poor joke of word 'presidential'. | staff failed to follow clear instructions on arrival with bags. the guest relations manager julia w , fobbed complaints off to william the duty manger, who thinks an apology in person is ok service, but i should come find him to get it in reception. (nb 'presidential suite' has a rain soaked terrace which william pointed out as an amenity, that i should appreciate. maybe william is too used to cold and wet oct weather.) the hotel facilities signage is really poor, actually room service is fast and efficient, a small oasis of quality within rest of problems.... i could go on, but why bother, i will go back to lanesbrough or berkeley in a heart beat, (both hotels much superior, close in knightsbridge) the one night costs 1000 plus on a small studio suite room, (presidential or not!) and one gets taken for granted. very poor experience, if i could have arranged it, i should have checked out rather than spend night here... avoid... do not bother talking to management team, next to useless... gives mandarin group a bad name... what an unpleasant experience, thank god it was only 24hrs...'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i had read the reviews before i booked this hotel so definitely expecting a lot more. unfortunately we got the basement room. the toilet smelt like a sewer, the room was dusty and the traffic noise made sleeping difficult. we told reception about the smell, when we were in the lounge the manager went to our room without our permission to check it out. he then stormed into the lounge almost accusing us of lying ranting about how clean the shower was. it was not the shower that was the problem. we also asked if it was possible to move rooms due to the noise but nothing came of that. i would not recommend this hotel.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''a very disappointing experience. i am a huge fan of the mandarin oriental in asia but the london property is rubbish compared to the rest of their properties. | the location is very convenient but its on a major road with all the noise issues that come with it. that said i would be most happy to stay there again if there service was half decent. the rooms are very pleasant but the room service is slow, the front desk is amateurish and it just gets worse from there. they could not even get my reservation dates right let alone check me into a non smoking room despite my reservation asking for one. the staff have all been trained to be very polite but that just makes their lack of follow through, knowledge and attention to detail even more infuriating. dreadful and disappointing and probably turned me from a mandarin oriental ambassador into someone who will never stay with the brand ever again - sad to say.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''currently staying in this hotel. booked to stay for 5 nights and thought the hotel looked good. arrived today, visiting london with mum. the room we have been allocated is so tiny and very unsuitable for a 5 night stay! we booked this hotel thinking it would be lovely but it is not! when we asked to move rooms we were shown a room with a double bed! then told we could upgrade and pay another 40 per night! we have already spent a considerable amount of money coming here and had we known how terrible the room sizes were we would have saved our money and stayed at a premier inn. staff are not really helpful, it really is not a 4 star. my advice is if you are looking to stay in london book somewhere else and do not waste your money on this hotel'''",0

A To Z Hotel,"'''was not expecting much at this price. the single room was small and filthy, i only managed to sleep due to the effects of a christmas night out. woke at 6a.m. the room was freezing, the tiny radiator was stone cold. cannot comment on the breakfast as i left immediately, to go home for a disinfectant bath. i will put up with the walk and stick with travelodge next time.'''",0
The Rembrandt,'''shockingly terrible customer relations. i would strongly advise finding another hotel- after all london has many and the rembrandt does not deserve the business. our flights were cancelled due to the snow but no question of a refund or even expression of concern. not good at all.''',0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my wife and i have stayed at several luxury hotels in london for special occasions but she had always wanted to stay at the corinthia. as a treat i booked for us and our friends to stay in 4 rooms for a group celebration for her 40th birthday. when we arrived my first surprise compared with other high end hotels that i have stayed in was that our bags were not taken from us at the door and our names taken, rather we took them with us to reception to check in. we arrived at 11:30 am which of course was too early for rooms to be available (as we expected) but the front desk took our bags and we were told they would be waiting for us in our room when we returned later which was good. this pre check in was functional and procedural but lacked customer engagement and rapport compared with other similar hotels. i felt even at this stage of the day that front desk were stressed. | we went off to explore london and whilst i was out front desk called me to ask did all of our rooms need to be on the same floor. i replied that they did not need to be, and that we would not be back at the hotel until 3pm so no rush. i was told that the rooms would be definitely be ready for us at that time and to come by and pick up our keys. | a couple in our group arrived separately at the hotel at 2:30pm and the were given a room that someone was already occupying. when they came back down and were allocated a new room they found they had been given an accessible room which was not suitable for bathing etc. the 3rd room they were given had no cups provided but the room it self was at last good. | on our return after 3pm i went to get my key for my wife and i. i was asked 3 times if i had definitely checked in already in the morning as i was not showing on the system. by now 2 people were querying the system whilst my friend's room keys were already ready prepared for them with no fuss. i was then asked my first name and with no comment acknowledgement was handed a key that she had made up there and then with a very cold attitude. no eye contact or well wishing words. when we got to the room our bags were not there leading us to deduce that our room had been missed off the prepared group of keys. my wife called down and asked for our bags and eventually after 25 minutes she went in person to reception to demand her cases be brought up. she was told the the hotel was very busy and concierge had a bag backlog but that our cases would be prioritised. the bags then arrived 10 minutes later. these are small things that in the hilton or marriott i would not even mention in a review, but at this price point and class of hotel i found these behaviours and excuses out of place. at other hotels of this class i am impressed when front desk staff who checked you in the morning, recognise you and address you by name or wish your wife happy birthday. i was pretty upset and stressed by this point that this expensive treat was being tarnished in the eyes of my wife and my friends who had 3 tries at getting a room allocated. | when we arrived at our room it was beautifully decorated and was apparently an upgraded room. we only found out this point out after we visited our friends rooms by comparison. surely when we picked our key up front desk would have been pleased to tell us we had been upgraded for my wife's birthday to highlight this kindness so we knew. | we had evening cocktails in bassoon bar. the service in here was friendly, attentive and prompt and we thoroughly enjoyed our drink in here. all of the staff in this bar deserve recognition as they delivered and exceeded on the their service. the cocktails were beautifully presented and well executed and the host was warm and friendly. | i went for a run in the morning and when i returned the door staff recognised me and offered to get me some water which was a lovely touch and one that deserves recognition of their attention. | we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant. all of the staff here seemed unhappy and did not want to be there. one of our party asked if she could have 2 fried eggs as she did not want the scrambled eggs on the buffet line. she was told that she would be charged additionally for these so she declined. this was a very expensive breakfast if it had been at walk in rates to find it was buffet. perhaps there were other options available (al a carte), but our waiter just directed us to the buffet. | when i checked out i was just told i had nothing to pay and my account was settled. i was not asked if i had had a nice stay, wished a safe journey or asked if i needed help with my bags or help arranging onward transport as would be customary. at check out my friend was presented his receipt on headed paper in an envelope, i received no receipt. as i say at a holiday inn this kind of service is functional and expected and maybe this is where the corinthia place themselves? | in summary i was very disappointed with our stay at the corinthia and very sad that this big event had been a let down on my wife's birthday. as stay at a nice hotel is about the experience but this hotel appears to be all about the building and the rooms and not service that delights. | mr moran'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''i stayed here with my friend and her 2 teenage daughters. we had a family room. we were greeted by a lovely receptionist who was so helpful with directions to the city, bus and train information and wished us a pleasant stay. the room was certainly big enough for us and clean but did smell a bit. i poured some pop into one of the coffee cups only to discover it was dirty. although right next to a busy road, we barely heard the traffic from our room. unfortunately we could hear pretty much everything else from inside the hotel. lots of banging, walking up and down corridors and doors opening and closing all through the night. the shower was nice and hot but no floor mat, so tiles became slippery when wet. we woke at 7.30am and went for breakfast around 8.30, it was very disappointing! all that was left were a few sausages, beans and tomatoes. when asked if more meat would be brought out, we were told ""no!"" now its a buffet breakfast and they knew how many guests were staying, why were we not all accommodated for?? i had a fried egg, a slice of toast, tomatoes and beans. not my idea of a buffet breakfast. the breakfast staff barely spoke english, so asking for extra butter proved quite a task. there are definitely better hotels available at the same price, do not waste your money here.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''positioned as this contemporary chic art deco hotel, the mondrian london feels a bit cheap boutiquey, at best bourgeois. design is only as good as its usefullness, especially in the context of living spaces and nothing about the interiors of the rooms at mondrian lend themselves to utility. at least not for families. the tiny spaces may be suited for single business travellers who want to entertain at the popular in-house bar and use the room only for the bed. everything feels a bit over the top and pretentious but nothing is lasting or memorable about the mondrian. at least nothing good. | did i already mention that the room is tiny?yet somehow, there seems to be enough space to squeeze in a huge lounge chair with a foot rest but not enough space for storage when traveling with families. | the branding is excruciatingly loud and over the top. they have self branded perfumes and candles (for sale) in the room. even self branded liquor as part of the mini bar (also for sale). again, valuable real estate in the tiny room used as window display for their wares that i could have utilised to plant the baby's toys and avoid having to stumble across on the floor. | by the way, we checked in yesterday for three nights for the missus' business trip. with a baby on stroller, another on the way and two large suitcases. her business partner - the white guy travelling with us with a cabin bag got a free upgrade to a room twice our size with a patio. so we asked for one as well and were told ""that will be 205 quid a night more madam"".'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''was there last week (aug 2014) on a one night business trip. while paying more than 625 pounds for one night, i was assigned a very small room on the first floor with literally no day light and a small window that could not open. when i called to convey my dissatisfaction, i was offered to move to a new room, but to my surprise the generosity was at price of additional 200 pound to which i refused. at the end, i was given the same room on a higher floor so at least i could see so,e day light through the window. the room itself is very old, equipped with sink that hardly drains and furniture that have seen better days some 30 years ago. asking about wifi the answer was ""sure available but again at cost"". ""are you sure ?"", i asked ""as the price is already 625 pounds a night"". ""yes. paid wifi"", was the answer - ""management directive"". breakfast was ""ok"", but the staff attitude continued to be unpleasant. why ? i do not know and have no clue.'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''room 16 was very small and tired. my daughter was in the ucl hospital and the hotel was brilliant for the hospital location but one night in the room was enough. the bed was comfortable but small and under a window. tea &amp; coffee facilities are from a vending machine in the community lounge. breakfast was adequate but the brown bread was a cheap brand. the staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. | i would use this hotel again if i were in the same situation'''",0
The Savoy,"'''my wife and myself have just returned from a stay at the savoy, to celebrate our tenth weddin anniversary. | we were staying in a one bedroom suite, | to start with we had a chauffeur driver arranged to pick us up and take us to the hotel, | the driver was not there at the arranged time so not a good start, | after calling the hotel a few times and getting told the driver was on his way from he is 10 mins away to i will call the driver and get him to call you back, still waiting on driver to call, | after waiting for around 45 mins a car did arrive and we where taken to the hotel, | i would not wait 45 mins on a pick up but had to wait as did not know any local taxi numbers or the area as this was first visit to london, or would have got a taxi and sent the savoy the bill, | on arriving at the hotel and having no time for welcome tea or coffee my wife and myself went out shopping, the savoy provided a car to make up for previous disappointment, which was appreciated, but only to return to another disappointment in service, after returning from shops my wife called for a coffee only to get charged for this very good welcome by the savoy, | so beware your only allowed one complimentary coffee per day , at restricted time, | no one asked us if we wanted to book the river boat that is part of your savoy welcome, | we were not told how to connect to wifi, so had to ask, instruction reception gave did not work, | not told what package included with our suite welcome, embarrassing having to ask! | dined at kaspars, not faultless either, have done separate review. | breakfast the next morning we got room service at a charge of 35 each, | my wife's breakfast came on a plate that you could split in two just about, the plate had a big crack down the middle that you could pull one side away from the other do not know how no one did not see this, | i called the butler to let them know about this, | to first get told i can buy the plates in the shop, very good need to buy plates for my breakfast and i am getting charged 35 each, | then the butler eventually understands that my wife's plate with her breakfast on it is cracked, | he says i will get you an other one up right away. | when we get the new plate with the breakfast i was told there would be no charge for this plate, | i did not think he meant the plate of food he had just brought up i would have though he meant my wife's original breakfast and return the 35 for breakfast, i was wrong he meant the new plate of food, what a cheek! | at check out we got some of it sorted, | but i left feeling like, really the savoy did not want us here, i felt that the savoy think my wife and i are not good enough to be there, | i do not know, it was just not what i would have expected from a hotel as the savoy, | maybe they do not like my accent, i do not know. | maybe they do not like customers that say when some thing is not right i do not know, | wish someone would tell me. | if my wife and myself did consider returning to the savoy, as room was lovely and bed comfy, | the savoy would have to change as we cannot, we will still be scottish and if something is not right then we will say something is not right. | such a shame as my wife thought i am going to the savoy, it is going to be perfect but perfect it was not.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''i was entertaining clients at this hotel recently and upon finishing our afternoon tea i asked a member of staff to arrange a taxi for my two guests. the concierge asked where they were going and upon hearing the destination of heathrow airport he said that would be 120. when they were shown to the taxi i was very embarrassed to see a saloon car waiting for us and not a taxi at all. i asked the doorman to signal for a taxi off the rank and apologised to my clients. upon further communication i discovered their proper taxi had cost them only 76. i cannot believe a hotel of this standing would attempt to rip of their quests, i shall be looking elsewhere in future to take my clients.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''tiny room, high price and noisy works from 8:30 am which did not let me sleep...light in entrance did not work, too much stuff crammed into such a room no bathrobe, ice cold bathroom despite switching the towel heater. no floor heating. cold room no heating other than through air con which was noisy so had to switch it off. | really a disappointing experience. | in addition: poor breakfast service, uncharismatic spanish waitress who was looking at herself in the mirror behind me while talking to me. unpleasant greeting of my guests at breakfast (they complained to me). one night coming back late, doorman, man in red, 2 limo drivers talking to each other leaning on hand rails of the small entrance staircase barely moved to let us through, no greeting either. inside it was better. the staff greeted us. one morning saw the managers doing their review in the morning in lift lobby, trying to avoid eye contact with guests instead of coming out to them. finally a letter from the manager in the room informing about works (no such information at reservation) and a phrase i never saw in a 5 star hotel, ""if any problems do not contact me contact my staff""... | the location of the hotel is great for the knightsbridge/sloane street/harrods shopping area. if you do not plan to spend much time there just choose another location.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we decided to stay here instead of another very well known hotel left me feeling quite deflated and very disappointed. we checked in but had to wait for our room to be prepared. after finally being shown to our room, it reeked of what reminded me of embalming fluid. a very pungent odour that almost made me sick. we was hurriedly hushered back out and given a free cocktail until another room could be found. the room turned out to be a one bedroomed suite with a river view which i must admit was a really nice room especially the views. the only problems i found was trying to make the staff understand what i wanted. my soft eggs at breakfast turned up like rubber, things appeared in our suite that we never asked for and things we asked for disappeared. the highlight was supposed to be afternoon tea and i expected it to reflect the same quality as another very well known afternoon tea establishment that we have visited many times.again very disappointing, and after having the finger sandwiches that tasted so cold as if they had just been taken out of a freezer, you could hardly taste the fillings. the small cakes were next and although they looked amazing they too tasted soggy and the choux pastry was like shoe leather again extremely cold. the final two cakes again was a very big let down. the fudge cake was so dry and very gritty, and the other was panettone, which to me is a sweet bread and not cake as we was told. if i had known i would have spent the 120 for two of us at ""balthazar "" or ""laduree"" across the road. | although it is a very grand establishment and still retains its charm, i do think the staff need to listen more to what the customer wants instead of what they think they need.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''as a birthday treat for my chosen life partner, we tried that veritable institution that is the savoy. i have to tell you that i was sorely disappointed with the fare...it was dull and unimaginative, and as old-fashioned and fusty as the hotel itself. even the piano accompaniment was annoying,as the pianist was clearly a frustrated jazz musician who destroyed the classics she was playing.the connaught still reigns supreme for classic afternoon tea.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''booked the grand room ( expensive) we got an old room when we asked to change to a renovated room they said they could do nothing about that. while checking out we informed them that we will be back in few days (and have a reservation -for that return) and need a renovated room, the reception confirmed that. on our return we were given an old room where you could hear neighboring rooms and also hear their toilet flushing. the only acceptable thing about this hotel is its location. i cannot recommend this hotel to anyone.'''",0
The Rembrandt,'''the staff provided no assistance and were very offhanded.we were not given the type of room we were guaranteed even though i personally visited the hotel 2 weeks before to confirm our reservation.four times the check in staff provided wrong advice and we were put in the smallest room that we have ever stayed in-anywhere.definitely not 4 star.would not stay there again.''',0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we stayed at the mohp for one night for my 30th birthday. it was a lovely looking hotel in the centre of knightsbridge, just opposite harvey nic's and a few minutes from harrods. we had booked the hotel online on the hotel's own website and in order to secure the booking we had to give our credit card number as normal. when we arrived at the hotel we checked in at the reception and then were shown to our room by a member of staff....the man comes into the room with us and tells my husband to take a seat whereby he presents us with our booking details to ""check over"". he then asks to see my husbands credit card and takes down the details - we found this awfully strange as we had already given c/card at time of booking and were made to feel as though they wanted to make double sure we were'nt going to leave without paying or something. also, having just arrived we wanted to change, wash etc so we could have time for a bit of shopping but instead had to wait for this strange man to leave our room!! | eventually we were left in peace and the room was lovely and very well equipped with the exception of no tea/coffee making facilities which i thought was a bit of a shame. also in the morning there was no hot water for a shower - something you kind of expect in any hotel let alone like this. | on the plus side we had an exceptional meal in the folige - which really was faultless in every respect. after our meal we went to the mandarin bar for few drinks and were pleasantly surprised that they had a live jazz band and the place had a great atmosphere and great service. | when we checked out of the hotel the next morning again we were made to feel uncomfortable. the receptionist asked if everything was ok and i said yes and commented on how lovely our meal was in foliage. she then procceeded re-checked our bill and said ""oh i just want to check something with foliage and dialled throgh to speak to someone. i pointed out that we had paid for the meal at the end of the meal and not charged to the room wondering if that is what she was checking. and she still continued to phone through and ""double check"" this was actually true. she was obviously having dufficulty getting to speak to someone as we were made to wait for quite a few minutes before she eventually gave up and decided to take our word for it. overall we spent about 700 on a meal and 1 nights accomodation at thiis hotel and yet we left feeling uncomfortable and embarassed about being made to stand there while the receptionist was basically checking we were not criminals. it was a nice hotel in a great location but honestly i would not stay there again nor recommend it to friends after our experiences.'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''i am writing this review with the most honesty and integrity and it is extremely tricky putting it in the correct words to describe the newham hotel. it is a nightmare on elm street. newham hotel may be cheap but it is just not worth the time, effort money etc. at all!!! | let me put it to you in a more descriptive manner. me and my partner decided to go ahead and book the newham hotel for the night as we had some business in london. we live in leeds. this was my life's biggest mistake as the hotel lobby area was more like a 70s darts room. dreadful. the staff there do not greet you at all and act like as if you are taking their blood. disgusting customer service. anyway when going to the room which was like a maze as everything is on one floor. the carpets had puke and other stains on them. the smell was absolutely unbearable and i stated this to as soon as i walked in to which the man at the desk replied "" sir it is not a bad smell"" in his broken english accent. so immediately he has better judgement than my own nose. okay i smiled and we got checked in and made way to the room, which by the way he did not direct us, he pretty much gave us the key and said go find it, its down there. i was shocked that this organistation is still standing. | when approaching the room: there was damp and green mould around the walls on the outside of the room. (this was the case throught the whole of the hotels corridors) i thought this does not look too good. so as we walked in me and my partner took a deep breath as the smell almost hit you really hard in the face. it absolutely stunk!!! the damp and rot smell was something that my collection of collognes would not extinguish. i still get flashbacks of the dissapointing look in my partners eyes as to what i had done. she trusted me with booking the hotel and i thought cheaper option was better but boy was i wrong. none the less, we were there and it got worse!! you would not believe how worse. | so as we had travelled from leeds and it was a tiring journey by car we were feeling restless and my partner decided to have a soak. on the advert it stated has bath tubs. to our surprise.. nothing just a shower. i still thought hmm ok at least there is a shower. my partner was adamant for the bath tub so i went to the lobby and relayed info to the arrogant and very unproffesional man. he stated "" you read it wrong on advert sir, your bad"" i was like "" huh?"" that is possible i may have but how dare you? so i said ""fine my bad, thanks"" and went back to room. i was getting worked up now and to cool my anger i sat on bed and switched some telly on. the tv remote by the way was handed to us on arrival which made me think ""who pinches remotes"" then it all made sense. the area had many yobs and hustler looking people about but i did not want to be judgemental and thought maybe this is the style or trend around these areas. so as i was watching telly my partner shouts at me from the bathroom and states that the water is cold. i said nah she is imagining that. so i went in and had a check. she was right the water was unbarable. i asked if it came out warm forst she said yes for 3-5 minutes. i went and complained to the man. he said "" sorry we will look at this, i will check the boiler"" i respoonded with an okay. after another 5 odd minutes of waiting, no difference. again we waited a further 10, no difference. i had lost it at this point. got on my phone checked for hotels and found a cheaper one on edgware road.. this was paradise compared to the hellbound newham hotel. even though it was last minute the rates were still good. i told her to get changed we are leaving this [--] because the very thought of further torturing my loved one in this way made me feel nowhere near like the man of morals that i am. i went to the man and unleashed on him. i am from a customer service related background so i know that no matter what customer is right but with in reasonable means. i expected a polit-ish response or atleast to try and console me as my wife was feeling ill and i had informed him of this. he replied "" oh so you use my hotel for 2 hours and now you wan tyour money back?"" i was reluctant to hit him and said "" you what? how dare you say such a thing?"" come with me now and check the water, what kind of a hotel does not provide a necessity as such? "" he stated no i will send my staff i am a manger here"" i laughed and said ""ok, whatever does not warrant you to act this way with anyone"". his staff member came and checked. he said ""yes it is very cold"" (in an indian accent) respectively as i am of asian background myself. my partner is dual heritage (white / asian). when this man came back with me to the lobby he said to the man ""it is coming out a little bit warm only"". i said "" mate, you were saying it is sub zero temperature in there and now its a little warm is it?"" i laughed hiding my anger and said "" you guys are running this place illegal are not you?"" the arrogant manager responded in a nervy manner and said ""no, no we are allowed"" beats me what he meant by that. further to this i said ""are you going to refund me or not pal? cut the bull"" he stated "" no there is nothign wrong with this place, i will change your room why are you leaving why do not you want another room? huh huh? is it because you are finished with your business?"" at this point i threw my bag down, told my missus to sit in car and i ran towards the desk, i hit my palm on the desk and said "" how dare you say that? what are you insinuating?"" he acted like a victim and said ""so why are you shouting if it is not true?"" i said "" becuase you are insulting us and classing me amongst the regulars you have visit here. ( i know this becuase there were two teen boys with some teen girls calling them in to the hotel which he overlooked) i further asked him how changing rooms would help? i said to him ""the boiler is one for the whole building, each room does not have a seperate boiler so how will changing a room help us? "". he had nothing to say accept. i am not giving money back. i said not a problem. i will tell people about this place not to defame you but to stop honest people coming to this brothel you run here. | the choice is yours fine people but i promise you that you will wish you had taken this eperience of mine that i had just earlier this month very very seriously as it will ruin your trip and your morale immensly. | the managers style was so backwads it was not even an autocratic style it was just.. something else. he had a face you would walk into with a hammer. a very smug disgusting smile and look. | thank you for reading. happy hunting. trivago is a good site that is where i got the lifeline from when i was in the dump. ;)'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''disgusting service from this hotel! they have held the deposit for over 2 weeks now, despite 6 phone calls! daylight robbery, be warned! never staying here again or any others in the chain!! | really put a downer on our stay and ruined my birthday by holding funds for so long! still not heard a thing! | plenty of better hotels in london which release the deposit when you leave! no idea if we will even see ours back, no sign of it being returned and shockingly useless unhelpful staff!'''",0
London Guest House,"'''we booked this guest house following great reviews on trip advisor. when we got to the , guest house we found that it was in a built up area on exceptionally busy main road, sadly the guest house and area in which it is situated seemed run down and my sister was unwilling to initially get out of the car as she felt, unsafe we went in to reception and were unhappy and so went elsewhere.losing a night s money, we did not go past reception area and so cannot comment on inside of the guest house etc,'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''the dorchester is not horrible, but there are so many better luxury hotels in london now. | most of the hotels by firmdale group (like the soho hotel and the ham yard hotel), the rosewood hotel, and the corinthia hotel are all on a completely different level of modern luxury. | i stayed one night in a studio suite at the dorchester and left. it is simply not my taste (which is to say that i have taste). i love great design, including modern interpretations of class concepts and many contemporary hotel. i do not like to see decades of makeovers, like layering more and more veneer, no matter how nice, on top of what is fundamentally a hotel designed for another era. | in simple terms, hotel design has changed (rapidly over the past decade), and it has left this hotel (like its cousins living off their legacy reputation) in a structurally impossible position. there is simply no way to change the room layouts or the design of common amenities for modern times. | for example, bathrooms in luxury hotels today typically have a separate toilet room, and bathrooms tend to be much larger than they were long ago. but that is not the case at the dorchester, where even the studio suite had a toilet and bidet lined up between the tub and the sinks. | another example is spa allocated to a gym. if you are looking for a great gym at a hotel, do not look to the dorchester. the ""fitness center"" is a tiny little hole of a room in the deepest recess of the basement of the hotel. i guess people of the age of their target customers do not work out. | and lastly, i will comment about a tiny little detail that tells you just how old this property is. when walking down the hallways, every floorboard squeaks. and in my room, it was same squeak squeak.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''this is really like two hotels in one. there are the expensive rooms, which are on the small side with really tiny bathrooms. the one we were in looked a bit worn. then there are the really expensive rooms which are a good size have a lovely bathroom with a jet tub and look recently renovated. the location is good, and the rooms are quiet. but i think there are better values to be had.'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''my husband and i were won over by the rave reviews for this place on tripadvisor and so booked for six nights. | pros: it is very, very clean and the location is fantastic; there is access to multiple tube stations and plenty of shops and restaurants. several of the main tourist attractions are within a twenty-minute walk. | cons: i have traveled extensively in the uk and europe before, so was prepared for lots of steps, no lift, tiny rooms, some noise in a lively city, etc. our room was on the top floor (room 32), which meant a climb of sixty steps every time, which got pretty wearing after awhile. once in the room for the night, sleep is close to impossible. the beds are old and rock hard, the pillows like bags of wet sand. our room faced onto the street, and the traffic noise was just unbearable: periods of silence broken by eardrum-shattering engine revving and wailing sirens racing down the block, all night, every night. we could have closed the window, but that brings us to another issue: the room was stiflingly hot and yet it never got above 65f the entire time we were there! we were covered in sweat just sitting still. there was no air movement whatsoever, and i cannot imagine staying this this place in full summer. my husband asked if they had a small fan and was told no. | i agree with other reviews that the male owner, mr. rees, is cantankerous, rude, and disagreeable (had no issue with his wife). there is wifi and a computer, but it is very old and slow, like everything else there. there is a machine for tea and coffee in the lounge, and an old soda machine that stole a bunch of our change. staff was moderately friendly, but nothing above and beyond the norm. | bottom line: budget accomodation has its place, i have no issue paying for a room that is essentially just a place to sleep and shower, and have done so many times, but it is another matter entirely to be so uncomfortable that you are completely unable to sleep. i will never stay here again.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i had arrnaged for a group of friends to spend the day here having treatments and relaxing. unfortunately the day was not as relaxing as a spa day should be. | i arrived around 915, and the lady on reception did not seem to be expecting us although the first treatment was booked in for 10am and you are advised to arrive early. in the pool there were childrens swimming lessons going on, which we learnt were to go on until 2pm which was the majority of our day there. although the smallprint in the booking terms it does mention this, its not very obvious until you read through and the pool is completely taken over by the lessons and it was quite loud and stressful! during the treatments the families were up and down the corridor outside the rooms, which are right next to reception it was loud and distracting while the treatment should be calm and relaxing it was not. | | we were also told that for lunch which is included in our booked package, we would need to get changed from the robes and go for lunch, and then get changed again on return to use the spa again. if we had known this we would probably not have gone with the package it seemed like a lot of hassle to do so as you wasted time on the day faffing around! | the facilities were not really equipped to cater to our party of 7 with just two bed loungers in the pool area there was a quiet room with a few loungers but there was another group in there also and it was quite a way away from the pool.the changing areas are small and awkward when busy there. | | when our party was changing and getting ready to leave, we noticed that all of our swimwear had been bleached. completely ruined. i took this to reception, and the manager took a note and said he would come back to me regarding this once levels in the pool were checked. it took a couple of weeks to hear back from him and only with my own persistant chasing. he has said he is satisfied that the levels were correct so cannot replace our costumes - and that no other complaints were made. i would have thought seven complaints of ruined swimwear in one day was sufficient enough. all of them were ruined, turning brown or purple all over with the bleach. one of the ladies had a bracelet on which looks tarnished and dull from the water also and i overheard another lady in a separate group mention her hair dye was running after the shower which was most unusual - probably from the same reason our costumes were ruined!! | i appreciate these may sound like minor issues (apart from the bleaching of the costumes) but the idea of a spa day is one where you are relaxed and free from any aggravation. we did not leave the spa as relaxed and pampered as we had planned. i was irritated about the costumes - and now that i have complained several times they have offered me the use fo the facilities again but i do not want to return to have another costume ruined in the water!!! i am appalled my the response of them not being able to replace the swimwear - i have never seen anything like this from any spa day or swimming pool. the response is not something you would expect from a supposed 4 star hotel spa in this part of london. | do not waste your money!!'''",0
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''the rooms and interior is very inspirational and classy, as you would expect for the prize you pay. most fantastic is the pool and spa area, not crowded and great for a swim in fantastic surroundings, very attentive staff if you want a drink between the laps. i also tried the massage that was very good, even if it was expensive. | it as really only one negative thing and unfortunately this is sticking to my memory. since we had plans for the evening the restaurant was not open yet so we thought we will have something quick in the bar - bad mistake. we both choose the ny beef and a glass of red wine. the first surprise was the red wine glass for around 15 pounds, the smallest serving i have gotten in my entire life. i told the bartender and she replied that she ""really appreciated my feedback but there was nothing in the power of the hotel to solve this issue.."" am i on candid camera? then came the beef - so chewy that it was impossible to cut with the fork that was provided - reminding of a fork you had when camping as a student. after a while they managed to find one new fork, which as a gentleman i gave to my partner.. horrible bad service rip-off feeling. having said that it may be unfair of me to downgrade the whole stay for this one bad experience.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''firstly you cannot beat the location. that is probably the best you can say. | this is not a bad hotel but it is not a great hotel which it should be with its location and rates charged. | check in was formal and not one bit friendly or welcoming.i had booked two rooms for a five night stay and in the comment section requested that the rooms be close to one another, a very simple request and one that has been fulfilled in many hotels of higher and lower expense in the past.it fell on deaf ears. i was given the standard line of '' hotel is very busy and we cannot fulfil all requests'' in monotone. great thanks for that, after i had a 50 cash deposit taken despite my credit details being on file our party separated and made our way to our bedrooms. | spotlessly clean and the most boring and dreary rooms, ours was in what must have been the basement, for the rate payed a real disappointment. our friends rooms had a beautiful view and v&amp;a museum , the rate paid was exactly the same. very hard to swallow the disparity especially at these rates. | evening dining is something to be avoided but breakfast is good and the staff more upbeat. | checkout was quick and uneventful and did not included any inquiry about our stay. | in summary, location is fantastic , staff very hit and miss as are the rooms.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''through a ba deal, stayed here for two nights free. the hotel was worth what we paid for it. rooms are rather small, though not tiny, but badly in need of renovation. carpet looked like it had not been replaced in 40 years, very dirty at the base of the walls where a vacuum cleaner could not reach, and the furniture was battered by similar decades of use. the room was airless -- no a/c and a window that could be opened a couple of inches kept the room unpleasantly hot at night even when the outside temperature was in the 60's. the breakfast was poor to mediocre. most people staying at the hotel appeared to be young or with small children, tourists looking for relatively inexpensive accomodations. on the plus side, the hotel offers free internet which worked very well, and it is well located directly across the street from the victoria &amp; albert museum and only a couple of blocks from the south kensington tube stop. to be fair, we probably got a bad room because of the ba deal but i have to assume that many other rooms are in similarly poor condition. would not stay again even for free.'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''i do not know why this place is called a hotel it should be called a hostel.. | it is not central and is a long walk to and from the underground. | the rooms are tiny and they smell musky. we had dirty towels, very cheap toilet paper. | the shower flooded badly. | the pillow cases were stained as was the carpet. there was dirt marks on the wall and a child had drawn all over the dressing table. | the staff did not speak good english and just sat watching films! | i would not stay here again and i do not recommend it at all. | my advice is pay the extra and stay in a travel lodge....'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we were glad to leave! | we had hoped to grab an hours sleep and have shower before going out in the evening but deafening and intolerable building noise - drilling and hammering - made this impossible. the manager said we could sit in the bar if we wanted peace and quiet. what we wanted was sleep and a shower - we could not do that in the bar! | he offered us a change of room but by the time we could have re-packed and moved, after he had found which rooms were available, 'the building noise will have stopped as the contractors finish at 5.00pm'. | he promised us that the building noise would not start the following morning until after 11.00am so we stayed in the allocated room. we were woken at 8.30am on the following morning, a saturday, by the unbearable noise permeating the bedroom and bathroom. we left as soon as we were dressed. | we were unable to use the room from 3.00pm - 5.00pm the day we checked in and at any time the following day. | neither the hotel web site nor the hotel staff/management had the integrity to warn us about the noise (which they knew all about). we were lied to over the start of the building work in the morning. | we were promised a partial refund covering the period the room was affected by noise but were told the booking system will take around 10 days to process the refund! a full refund would have been more appropriate as our stay was totally ruined.'''",0

The Rembrandt,"'''my family and l booked this hotel for 2 weeks and we all found it to be such a disappointing experience. apart from the location and the impressive facade, when we entered, our first impression was negative. the staff ignored us for about 15 minutes before we were acknowledged that we were waiting to check in. we were not greeted or welcomed at all. the staff member was rude and arrogant in her tone and manner. it felt like we were a burden. it was a very noisy hotel with lots of renovations happening. the builders were using the same lifts as the guests which was causing huge delays. the lifts were also used to bring up their ladders and building materials. on numerous occasions we witnessed hotel managers speaking rudely to their staff and embarrassing them. the hotel promised deals with their facilities on their website and did not follow through with them, even after they acknowledged it was their mistake. they also open their facilities to the public and therefore we as the hotel guests are restricted in using certain areas of the gym.the breakfast was very disappointing. even though it was included in our stay, we refused to eat their again and went next door. what is really sad about this hotel is so much effort and cost has been placed on renovating, but nothing on staff training and development.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed at the rembrandt for four nights last month. i was travelling on business and wanted to choose a hotel that was close to kensington. in terms of the location of this hotel, it is excellent. you are close to harrods, kensington and knightsbridge, and victoria is only a short taxi ride or a couple of tube stops away. as such, i was perfectly located for business and could walk to all meetings. | the room itself was on the small side, but it was perfectly comfortable. there was a good internet/communications package in the room, and it was decorated quite tastefully and had the usual features you would expect from a corporate hotel. while there was no ""wow"" factor about the place, it was perfectly fine. | the aspect which let us this hotel down is the restaurant. while breakfasts were excellent, the restaurant only puts on basic pub grub at lunch and in the evening. this is expensive for what it is and should really be avoided. | i arrived late on my first evening and did not want to venture out as it was nearly 10pm. dinner was served until 10, but i was the only person in the dining room. the staff were surly and unhelpful as if by ordering close to finishing time i was giving them too much work....i ordered a simple pasta dish which came back cold, mushy and worse than i ever cooked as a student. one glass of wine took 15 minutes to arrive, and that too was tasteless and expensive. suffice it to say that i never went back to the restaurant, and nor did anyone else by the look of the place on subsequent nights. | would i return to this hotel? possibly, but only if i needed to be around kensington and everywhere else was full.....'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i am writing this review in addition to a review previously left by my wife. on a recent stay my family had money taken from our room. my wife has a fairly complicated purse with a number of pockets and we had split our money between these. we had money taken from two different pockets (one of which was hidden on the inside of the purse) and to suggest that on a 30 minute (at most) journey someone had opened my wife's bag, which was pressed against her body, taken out her purse, looked through it and taken only a few notes from each putting the rest back then returning her purse is laughable. at no point has the police intimated to us that they feel the money was taken outside of the hotel. | the cleaner seen entering our room on two separate occasions did no cleaning on either occasion. they did not move or clean anything in fact. when asked about this in front of me, the duty manager even said it was 'unusual' and he did not know why they had returned or entered the room on the first occasion. | it does not take much searching on the internet to find reviews from as far back as five years stating 'my mom &amp; i visited this hotel in sept. 2008 we noticed our luggage was rifled/gone-thru on a daily basis when we were out &amp; about &amp; the management did not seem upset/enraged when we informed them of this,&amp; this distressed us immensly'. this has been cut and pasted so please excuse the spelling but this shows that previous behaviour of this nature has been reported. | the response from your customer services manager to my wife's review has been very upsetting to my wife who at no point suggested that people should stay away from the hotel as the actions of one should not affect your entire staff. however your attempt to discredit her and make her seem a liar has added to the distress caused by the theft. we are out of pocket and the majority of the money taken was given to me for my birthday the day before as a donation to a charity very close to our hearts so they have also lost out. | i hope people will find both my review helpful when checking their belongings before departure as it is likely when it occurs, small amounts will be taken from departing guests in the hope they will not notice or will be gone before they are able to complain. i also hope they find your previous response helpful in showing the level of support they should expect should they encounter a problem in your facility.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''on our recent trip to london my sister booked sunday lunch for 4 at the hotels restaurant on my behalf. | we arrived early and sat in the lounge and had a drink while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. all good so far | my sister and friend arrived more pre-lunch drinks, still going well | now for lunch. settled on the 2 course carvery, starter and main. | starter- excellent. very fresh, loads of choice. 1st class. | main- very poor. lamb very fatty. (i know to expect a little fat but this particular cut very poor) and only 1 choice of meat (website stated choice of 2). choice of veg limited and all luke warm as was the meat and no yorkshire puddings! and to cap it off limited amount of gravy...asked for more but fell on deaf ears....we managed to eek it out amongst the 4 of us. | drinks- ordered prosecco (2 bottles in total) to have with lunch. arrived at the table un-opened and no ice bucket. i should have mentioned it at the time but could not be bothered with the hassle. | in summary for 220 (including 10% included gratuity) for food and drinks the overall experience fell way short of expectation. staff friendly enough however serving un-opened wine at a table with no ice bucket is reprehensible in the restaurant business,(especially a 4 knightsbridge hotel!!!) coupled with luke warm main course- not good practice. | i left the tip on the bill as i believe the concerns were not due to bad service (apart from the un-opened wine-training required?) but to poor attention by the restaurant manager to allow the food to drop below temperature during a lunch service. | i will not be returning or recommending.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''would not go back here again, only to use the spa. the bar is average, the breakfast woeful. i wanted fried eggs, without the top being snotty. sent the eggs back 4 times, the last time - the fifth- they turned up burn't around the edges. the bacon was like cardboard. something you would expect in a motorway cafe, that had left the bacon under a heater all day. and i had to pay for the breakfast. the front door staff, were excellent. my wife &amp; i, were sitting at a stool table &amp; a member of staff asked us if we could move to accommodate a newly arrived party. unreal. i had so many complaints, about poor service i could write a book. but, there are much better hotels available. there are good things about the hotel, but i would not go back. i would use the spa, as i think it is one of the best for treatments. espa, is the best for facilities.'''",0

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''on the positive side, the location is good, the reception staff very polite and professional, and the hotel seems to have been renovated relatively recently to a very good standard. | i was a single occupant, travelling with a small overnight case, staying in what is allegedly a double room (rate 170 per night without breakfast). the room was small, so small that i could not put my carry-on case on the floor to open it, and still be able to walk from one end of the room to the other. wi-fi is available and included in the price of the room, but in my room on the 5th floor the signal was weak and intermittent. | yes, there is a samsung tablet available in the room and this is a nice touch, but let us face it - anyone booking into a hotel in this part of london will be travelling with one. l'occitane toiletries may have been considered a height of sophistication in hotels some years ago, but these days they are hardly a selling point. | in short, xenia is ok. there are some nice details. however, put together and placed in an extremely small room with half-working internet, they simply do not justify 170/night.'''",0

The Savoy,"'''a 5 star luxury hotel like the savoy is not the sort of hotel that i get the opportunity to stay in often, so on a recent visit there i was so shocked and fed up with the lack of attention and sloppy service offered that i thought i should share my personal experience before you fork out hundreds to stay there. i thought i was going to be impressed with everything from the moment i got there, but it was quite the opposite. the man behind the reception kept us waiting while he chatted and laughed for a number of minutes with the people in front of us who he was checking in. that would have been fine if he had shown the same level of friendliness and attention to us, but he was bordering on rude when it was our turn. he suddenly turned totally cold and just wanted to get rid of us i think. maybe i was not carrying the right designer handbag to impress, but all i know is that he made me feel unwelcome if anything, so not a good start. the room was nicely decorated but small, and as we were close to the lifts all you could hear throughout the night and from early on in the morning were people going in or coming out of the lifts. somebody even thought it was funny to bang on our door at 3 am. after a late night on the town. if you are going make sure you ask for a room well away from the lifts otherwise it will ruin your sleep. the worst thing about the room was the smell coming from the drains in the bathroom. it wreaked! my husband asked if we could change rooms but they told us it was not possible and they had never had anyone mention the smell before, as though we were making it up. we obviously closed the door but even with the window open it stunk. although it sounds crazy to be saying this about such an iconic hotel, we were ""fortunately"" only staying the one night, so we just put up with it. in the morning on our departure we stopped and mentioned our grievances to the front desk, but in true form the woman was uninterested and barely could bring herself to apologise for anything. we left with a real sour taste in our mouths and after spending so much money i think it was a disgrace the way the staff treated us. not impressed.com!'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''the room had two twin beds, a sink, a small wardrobe and a desk, and barely enough room to walk between the two beds. even though the carpet that showed between the beds was only a small strip, it had not been vacuumed. also, it was an usually warm night in early october in london, and the room was hot. we finally resorted to opening the window, and the street was very noisy - lots of traffic, the occasional police siren, etc. it was within walking distance from euston station and was relatively cheap, but i wished while still awake at 2:00 am that i had taken a metro to a hotel in a quieter neighborhood. the breakfast was good, though, and the waitstaff were excellent.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''while some aspects of the stay were as you would expect for such a famous hotel, other aspects of the hotel fell very short indeed. | firstly, our afternoon tea was awful. not only did our food not arrive at the same time, but our foods - even though we had ordered the exact same things - were vastly different. three people ordered finger sandwiches, one person got ten, the second got eight, and the third got four! furthermore one person ordered scones and got four massive ones. two people ordered a portion of scones each and received smaller and less than the individual portion. the service was sloppy and lacking in cheer and not what one would expect. in the hotel's defence, after i complained we were apologised to and sent chocolates. | the food was inconsistent, as was the standards of the hotel. while the reception area was nice, so was the room the spa and pool were awful! the pool looks like something from the 90s, and is far too small. they also do not have a jacuzzi or any or the more relaxing things that you would find in 'lesser' hotels. | the hotel was very good in some areas and terrible in others. what finally turned me against the savoy however, was the way in which they treated my luggage. my suitcase is a very rare type and while it is a pull along, it must be treated carefully! the porters at this hotel loaded everyone else's - far cheaper and much hardier - luggage on top of my 2,500 suitcase, which incidentally is not very large, and proceeded to pull my case through a puddle. needless to say, i was not impressed.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i have stayed at a number of 5-star hotels in a number of cities recently, but had never stayed at a mandarin oriental until this trip and was really looking forward to the experience. | we flew in from boston on tuesday and checked into the hotel wednesday morning. the hotel and location were gorgeous, check-in was friendly and quick and we were given a room even though we would arrived early. the room was spacious and clean - no complaints there. the tub was very narrow, but i have come to expect that in europe. the view was abysmal: what appeared to be a narrow, filthy utility/service area with neighbors' windows right outside our own. i was fine with that as i had not planned to spend too much time in the room looking out the window anyway and did not request a room change. the bedding was about the most comfortable i have experienced in any hotel and we slept fantastically the first two nights. | then came friday. after a long day walking more than 16 miles around london, we returned to the hotel to have a cocktail in the trendy and cozy bar before retiring to room for the night. unfortunately it seemed some guests had checked into the suite across the hall from us and were throwing a party of some sort. getting off the elevator, the smell of cigarettes immediately shocked me although i was on a smoke-free floor. we could hear thumping bass coming from down the hall that sounded like a nightclub, and as we approached our room realized with dismay that both were coming from the room across the hall from ours. we called the front desk who sent security up to speak with them. i heard the agent tell the guests that it was the third time they would been called up there already. things quieted down, security left, and within a matter of minutes, the thumping and laughing started up again. now, i am not normally one to rain on someone is parade or begrudge a good time, but this was around 3 in the morning. we sat sleeplessly in our rooms until about 5:00 when we finally called the front desk again: same routine as before. i emailed the hotel's management contact at that point describing my experience and disappointment, giving them the chance to respond before posting a public review (which i would regard as unfair). we finally got to sleep at about 5:30 in the morning and slept restlessly until just past noon, losing half a day in the city we would come to visit and awaking tired and drained. | i spoke to nicole who was the manage on duty, and she was very friendly and sympathetic. she apologized and offered us a suite for our final night. unfortunately, we were not going to be returning to the hotel until late that night and would need to check-out at 6:00 to get to the airport, and it hardly seemed worth the effort so i declined. she then offered to take 50% off our room rate for the last night and promised that security would be posted on our floor to make sure there was not a repeat of the previous night's craziness. | i was therefore extremely surprised and disappointed when i returned to the hotel around 11:00, exhausted, to find that very scene once again unfolding in full effect. the smell of cigarettes was once again staggering and had seeped into our own room by then, and the music and partying was, if anything, louder than the night before. i saw no security on the floor. long story short, after a couple more calls we gave up and left the room at 5:00 without sleeping at all and called for a ride to the airport where we were able to sleep a bit at one of the lounges. before leaving we spoke to martin (manager on duty) who agreed to take the remaining 50% of our last night's stay off the bill and once again apologized for the inconvenience and offered to move us to a different room for the remaining 90 minutes of our stay. | now, i am more generous than a lot of people when it comes to situations like this and completely understand that a hotel cannot and should not control all the actions of its guests at all times. i was willing to forgive the first night of hell as an aberration and take them at their word. but after a second sleepless night it became clear that the hotel was either incapable or unwilling of handling the situation. i suspect that the folks staying in the suite across from us were paying a much higher rate per night than i was and management did not want to lose that money; it was much more cost effective for them to refund us one night than it would have been to move or evict the folks in the mandarin suite. so the bottom line is that we slept a total of about 6 hours between friday night and sunday morning, this after having already lost a day of sleep flying in from boston two days prior. and the time we spent awake, we were exhausted from lack of sleep, impairing our ability to even enjoy the city i would come to explore. | again, i am not holding holding the hotel responsible for the behavior of its guests, but for its reaction to and handling of the situation. if you check into a 5-star hotel like the mandarin, you expect, at a minimum, that you will be able to sleep. i could not. additionally the smell of cigarettes followed me back home so that when i opened my suitcase the memory of those sleepless nights came rushing back. i wanted to love this hotel, but given their inability to rectify this situation after two nights i simply cannot recommend them to anyone looking for a peaceful, relaxing stay in the middle of a large bustling city. we had a much better experience at the horseguards in august, although the location is not as good. i have had more relaxing stays at the holiday inn.'''",0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''went for super expensive lunch, having handed over my car to the valet for parking; have done so many occasions before, never paid for parking before, and always handed the valet a generous tip upon return of my car. | on this occasion, upon return from lunch (150 for 3 people!), i was asked to pay 45 for 75 minutes worth of parking. i had not been informed of the fact that a charge would be levied, with the valet claiming that he had told me (this is part of the scam, he had not). | queried this with a whole raft of people at the hotel of ascending seniority, only to be told that the valet department had nothing to do with them (????) and that they would refuse to return the keys to my expensive car if i refused to pay up. | had my wife and son with me and therefore decided to settle; had i been on my own, i would have asked them to call the police. paid the bizarre sum of 25.90 and left, to never give these thieves any business again. | the irony is that this review alone will cost them thousands of pounds in lost revenue with those readers who decide to give the hotel a miss based on what i wrote. | the thing to do of course, as any manager of a 5 star hotel would not know (but not ""inga"" apparently) was to let me go on my way with their compliments.'''",0
The Savoy,'''went for afternoon tea for my birthday. we were early and were promised a table earlier than booked - but were then forgotten about. waited 15 minutes at table to be served by our waiter. tea was luke warm. the sandwiches and pastries were lovely as one would expect (chicken and lemongrass finger sandwhich in particular was delicious). service was not so good - one of the group described it as being on the wrong side of relaxed. we had to ask for more tea a couple of times when ours had gone cold or they forgot to re-charge one of the group's pot; our waiter disappeared for an hour and we were left with someone else who seemed to want to chat and joke with customers rather than serve them. the tea room is lovely and light and the piano music was excellent. worth doing but we were just left with empty plates and cold tea for too long too many times - which was annoying and therefore made it not a wholly enjoyable experience.''',0
The Savoy,"'''my husband and i have stayed at the savoy once before our two children were born and loved every minute of the stay, it was luxurious and the service was impeccible. however this was not the case when we revisited the savoy after the reopening with the children whilst visitng family in london. the hotel is not child friendly and does not allow children in the bar at any hour of the day, this was forgiven at first but we later found that other areas of the hotel were also not suitable for children. another quick point to make is that although the service was impeccible at our first stay this unfortunatly can not be said for our last stay! perfect for those who do not have children, if you raise your concerns about the standard of service they are very accomodating, this however was not needed before the reopening.'''",0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''yes this is a trendy hotel in an excellent location with great cocktails ( that come at a huge price ) and some great staff but what good is a hotel when you cannot get any sleep!! the hotel is an old building that has been modernised, but they still have major issues with their pipes in any given room at any given time . trouble is they do not know which room and what time !!. it literally sounded like a ships horn tooting in my room from 5 am onwards . when i checked at the desk that am , i was told they d never heard of this issue before, so i left it at that . the next morning ( after getting to bed at 2 am) i was woken again with a repeat performance! i have had 3 children in 3 years so i am used to noise, but i paid a phenomenal amount of money to escape noise and 5 am starts. again i addressed this at the desk and was given an unsatisfactory answer . finally sam ( manager of front of house ) came out and said this is an ongoing issue and i should have been moved the first night. as an apology he took the drinks off my bar bill from the night before and said get intouch with future dates for me and my family and we would be put up in a suit over looking the thames! was so impressed with his acceptance of fault and make up suggestions that i decided not to write a review. however this was all lip service. i ve now tried to get in touch on several occasions and of course no response. very very disappointing especially as i did not ask for this future stay, it was offered. shame on you. | finally the day after i came home i got an email saying that upon change over, they had found a suitcase in my room and what would they like me to do with it. i did not leave a suitcase in the room, which kind of means the room was not cleaned properly before i checked in. no one noticed someone elses left suitcase in my room when getting it ready for a new guest, interesting...... | other low points, too trendy to provide toothbrushes and even a toilet brush ( lol) ring house keeping for a tooth brush and you may wait up to 8 hours like me and several repeat calls. finally rooms on level 4 at the back are dark and need the lights on all day even if bright and sunny outside, you are completely in the shade. | highs, excellent location, some friendly and efficient staff, great drinks and a bar with a good vibe, cinema on site. | my advice, if you stay and have the pipes playing you a tune , request a new room immediately and a refund for the night / am that was ruined, i am sorry i did not.'''",0

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''stayed at the corinthia for 4 nights for a combination of business and holiday. visually, the hotel is stunning - absolutely worth the 5 star rating. sadly, the service is not up to that level. maybe this is a factor of being relatively new. | the first issue came when my 7 year old son and i arrived. the person at check in invited us to go view the pool and fitness center. we did so (these are accessible, or rather relatively inaccessible) through the spa. when we went to the spa and said we would like to look at the pool and fitness facilities as per reception's suggestion we got passed off to 4 different people, having to explain to each why we were there. it was terrible, they made us feel like we should not be there, with their comments such as ""we do not give tours"" nd acting like they were doing us a special favour letting us in. finally we got lead down a very opulent but warren-like spa to ""near"" the pool. they refused to let us actually see the pool. then they said my son could only swim in the pool during two off-time 1 1/2 hour slots. way to make your guests feel unwelcome! | next we tried the restaurants. again they look lovely, but i was concerned to find something my son would like. after some time looking at the menu, i asked if perhaps there was a children's menu. wow! turns out there was, unfortunately even if you are with a child they do not think to show that to you unless you specifically ask for it. | the third strike was in getting the room made up. they have these lovely little buttons in the room, one of which says ""make up room"", so we left at 9:30am having pressed the ""make up room"" button. we came back briefly at 2pm, light still on, room not made up. we came back at 5:30pm - room still not made up. we phoned down, they asked if we had called down int he morning to ask for the room to be made up. really? would not having your room made up at some point in the day be a relatively regular occurrence in a hotel? especially a supposed 5 star one, especially if you had this crazy idea that lighting the ""make up room"" button actually alerted them to make the room up? | last little jem - their wireless is hopelessly slow. reminded me of the good old days of dial-up. | there are lots of great hotels in london - next time i will choose another one!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i had stayed at the rembrandt some years ago and though i did not find the hotel superb, i found it nice and with a good location. that is why i decided to book it again in my recent trip to london. i had booked a standard double room for 130 gbp with breakfast. | when i arrived at the hotel i was told there was no smoking room available in rude and unfriendly manners by the girl at the front desk whose name was juliane. i told here i had booked a smoking room but she returned i had requsted one, it did not mean i would get one. after much conversation and no help from her to attend my request i told her i would pay for an executive room if she had one. there was one available which would be more 40 gpb, that is 170 gbp. i accepted to pay it convinced i would get a great room. | in the meantime no one came to collect my luggage, 2 large suitcases, so me and my daughter took them to the room. | the executive room was tiny, dated and was no different from the standard room i had stayed some years before. i was also told we had wireless conection but the internet was not wireless, we had to ask the concierge for a cable and leave a deposit of 10gbp for it! anyway we were not able to get conection and no one made any effort to help us! every time i went to the concierge or the front desk i was treated with ice cold unfriendly manners, as if they were doing me a favour. | the buffet breakfast was dull, the choices were not plenty and the quality was bad, the croissants were dry, they seemed to have a few days already. the only good thing about the hotel was its location but i will never stay in this place again nor do i recommend it to anyone. it is expensive, dated and unfriendly with the worst service you can get in london. stay away from here!'''",0

A To Z Hotel,"'''it is far from the centre, it takes between fourty and fifty minutes to reach picadilly circus and oxford street. the tube is far, a half-hour walk, but there is a 24 h bus near at the door that leaves you in hammersmith, where you can take another metro or bus to the centre. the room was very dirty: the carpet with hairs and dirt, the walls and the old bedspreads with unidentified stains. only sheets and towels was good. broken and insecure door. views were blocked by the bright sign of the hostel. under our window, a shelf with garbage and used underwear. a lot of noises at the street, we had to buy earplugs to be able to sleep. the small bathroom was horrible, to take a simple shower was an odyssey. showerhead was fixed and very high, the watter keep falling far and to be under the watter i had to go beside the toilet. service was not very good, two days they gave us clean towels and only one day of seven they made our beds. our garbage cube was not cleaned any day. breakfast was in a kebab communicated with the hostel by a backdoor. to arrive, you have to go by one corridor with a full of towels and dirty sheets on the floor. breakfast was served on the same kebab with the removed shutters. was not juice, but it was water with taste of orange, cofee or tea, two toasted per person, a bit of marmelade and a misery of butter. if you want more butter, they said no. definitely, a to z was a deception.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''wow, it is the savoy london and we were so looking forward to stay with this historical hotel on the 26th feb | however to our rude shock this hotel has the worse welcome as compared to those 3* or 4* hotels we have stayed. | 1) unprepared room upon check in. this was the first time that we check into a top 5* hotel and was told that our room was not ready. this itself was a rude shock as we have never been asked to wait till 2pm in a top 5* hotel in any other parts of the world so for this it was already a boo boo | 2) all the host were robotics and have no passion in their job. the smile is not warm or sincere and they do not care about the guest staying with them. 3 fine examples below: | a) our host - i shall not mention her name offered to assist us to reserve a table with the grill restaurant at 1pm. upon arriving into the restaurant we were told that our table was right in front of the meet and greet counter which the restaurant host told us that they have asked the hotel concierge if we were alright with the table and you know what she- the hotel host made a decision for us without checking with us. which completely destroy our long desired lunch at the grill by gordon ramsay. | b) we were transferred to kaspar which the food was alright, nothing fantastic service was alright. but when i say she has no idea of what is customer service because she the same hotel host meet us again to bring us to our room, she did not even ask us how was our lunch. it came as a second rude shock again as this is definitely not the service from a 5* hotel | it was a awkward 1 minute in the lift to our room and when she realize what that we did not had lunch at the grill she did not apologize and all she said was ""they only have that table"" | if we knew, we would not have rush back from our shopping and having to go through a rough time to have lunch. | c) when we are in our room, we waited for 10 minutes for our luggage and we have to all reception to ask for our luggage. when the porter brought us our luggage they apologize profusely as they said there was a confusion with out luggage by the reception. we really wonder what is going on with the savoy! | 3) robotic service again when she tries to appease us by checking with us if we prefer red or white wine. when we told we usually do not drink so early in the day and white wine is preferred for us. | guess what? in 10 minutes the wine was brought to us while we were unpacking. i really wonder if she was deaf or simply cannot be bothered. if she would have asked us what we would like to drink like tea or coffee that would have made a difference and not insisting to send the wine up! | overall my experience of savoy. i should have stayed with the shard which at least i get a better view of the city and it was no coincidence that the kind taxi driver wishes us good luck for our stay with the savoy! | my notes - all the staffs needs to know what is a great client experience and attention to details. | otherwise it is such a waste of space and money with great history but lousy experience.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''we did not stay in the hotel and after our restaurant experience may feel reluctant to do so. upon arriving in london we decided to have coffee in the lounge at the rembrandt hotel. the service was excellent, the lounge comfortable and well appointed so we decided we would return for lunch - big mistake!!!! although, again service excellent, lunch delicious and beautifully presented (congratulations to the chef), the lunch was spoiled by some of the most unruly, noisy children that i have encountered. i have young nephews and nieces and although their parents are professional people they would not allow such behaviour in their workplace. | i can only assume that the children had some connection to the hotel owners as i cannot imagine that their behaviour would be tolerated under any other circumstances. they ran, continually screaming, around the tables, the dining and lounge area, with little or no intervention from the parents. on times we could barely hear each other speak. this behaviour continued for the whole lunch period and ruined, what would otherwise have been an enjoyable lunch. | the hotel owners should be made aware of this, as we were not the only people who were commenting on their behavior.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''the dorchester is a classic example of what a hotel should not be. the level of service here is very poor. first, upon checking in, i was lectured about why my room was not ready (it is not yet check-in time) though i have not only requested an early check-in, but also called from the heathrow pick-up arranged by the hotel to let them know that i was on the way (during the conversation they confirmed that my room was ready and waiting for me). | security is horrible. a drunken hotel guest was wandering my floor for over an hour, ringing the very loud doorbells (further enhancing my jet lag). when i called the frint desk to let then know that i had been awoken four times (and asked if they had security or a camera) i was not given a simple apology. | okay, on to the room. at around $900 us dollars per night, the room is 0 out of 10 on value. the bed is not comfortable, the sheets and pillowcases are starched to the point that they can almost stand on their own. the bathroom is very nice and the honor bar well-stocked. the tv is horrible with two volumes, it seemed: no sound or really loud. | back to the service. though my inquiries were very few and i am not at all rude (i travel all the time and genuinely like people who work at hotels) the attitude at the dorchester is that guests are an unwanted bother. | location is good, but not great. there are many better-situated hotels to the city center. | the fitness room is fair at best. very small, poor tvs, aging equipment. | finally, the hotel has a smell. it smells...old...like your grandmother's house when she is either too infirm to tend to it or getting too old to care. | this is not a good hotel. take the huge sack of money required to stay here and go elsewhere.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i was booked to this hotel by my travel agent. i would say i was impressed with the ambiance and the facility of the hotel. very classy and the location next to the river has an absolutely amazing view. | however, i have the worst check in and check out experience from the front deak staff. | he misinformed me about my different room booking reference &amp; rate to swap my room in the middle of my stay. in fact, everything was a miscommunication to me that none of the front desk staff informed me that i could continue staying in the same room, until i went to the front desk. | to make things worst, i have to check out early morning, and unfortunately the same guy had to process my check out. hes the most inexperience, slow and inefficient front desk staff i have ever had to deal with. in fact, there was no porter who could help with transferring my luggages to the taxi. | this is upsetting especially knowing this is supposed to be a 4-5 star hotel. to ask if i would stay here again, i doubt it. its convenient that its close by to my office.. but the front desk experience is not something i had rather recommend to any business travelers.'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''my mother and i went to the mandarin oriental for breakfast for my birthday in early march 2016. we were absolutely disgusted with the treatment following the severe food poisoning that i suffered from for the following 48 hours. the food poisoning was without doubt from the smoked salmon that i was served that morning; and i spent the rest of the day and night violently ill. needless to say, my birthday was completely ruined and the hotel did nothing but try to shift the blame whilst refusing to take any responsibility for the contaminated food they served me/ the lack of hygiene on the part of their kitchen staff. there was no compensation, and not even an apology was offered. was appalled by the whole experience and the way management dealt with this. will never return to this hotel and will be sure to spread the word so that my friends can avoid 48hours of horrific sickness in addition to the most vile and dishonest management.'''",0

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''given the very good reviews, i was expecting a much better experience than it turned out to be. the biggest problem -- in fact, really, the only problem -- was the size of the room. it was simply not manageable for 2 people. mind you, i lived in nyc for 5 years in a tiny apartment and go there several times for business per year. in other words, i know what small (hotel) rooms are like. however, even when comparing to nyc standards, this hotel was tiny and it simply was not comfortable for 2 people. there was too little space to put away clothes, etc. for 2 people, no drawers in the closet (just hangers), and no space to put the luggage without it being in the way and constantly bumping into it (mind you, we only had 1 luggage for the 2 of us). likewise, the bathroom was tiny, and i constantly bumped into things (no, i am not a particularly clumsy person!). this hotel room might perhaps be o.k. for 1 person only who is staying for a short period, with hand luggage only. also, offering instant coffee for a hotel at this level is kind of embarrassing. on the upside: all the staff was extremely nice and professional. again, they were really excellent. and, the lobby and bar look sleek and modern -- but none of this offsets the lack of space, which really took away from the comfort and pleasure of our stay.'''",0

Newham Hotel,"'''this hotel is worse i have ever stayed, suppose to book in 11am i turned up 1pm two hours late so room should of been ready, when i booked in to family room with wife 3 children could not believe, there was at least 6 painters painting the hall ways myself and my daughter both got paint on clothes and shoes the paint was on carpet dadoe rails everywhere and the fumes where horrendous, we went out returned at 10pm the painters had gone but smell of paint was still strong we stayed in hotel until 2am left and drove home my wife left her wedding rings on the side i called first thing in the morning to be told the cleaner had cleaned the room at 2'30am and was asleep nothing was handed in but they would speak to him when he got up, i said your not suppose to clean bedroom until 11am as we had room booked till then, but was told they cleaned it 2.30 when we left not not sure if they did but if you had room booked next door would you want cleaners banging and hoovering at 2,30am while your trying to sleep. little to say the rings as of yet have not turned up i am calling to speak to manager tomorrow as been told he does not work weekends,and ill be contacting the police as the hotel know the night cleaner cleaned room i will never stop in this hotel again everyone of the staff and painters where not english speaking so ill be contacting immigrants too book this hotel at your own expence but be carefull'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here with a group of couples. paid a large tariff for very basic small rooms. the best part of this hotel is the location. the rooms are just alright and am sure you can do better for similar prices or less. the staff need service lessons and need to learn to smile and interact with their guests. from the front desk to the concierge to the restaurant staff, everybody look and act as though they do not want to be there. really lacking in genuine human warmth. i would shop round a bit next time.'''",0
The Dorchester,"'''went here for afternoon tea. pleasant surroundings, but ... cold tea? how difficult can it be to get the most simple things right? astonishing. even when the refills came, the water was not properly hot. ultimately the grandeur and pomp are lost when a place falls down on the basics. with standards having slipped like this, the impression remains that this is a place living on its past. just another overpriced london 'experience', unfortunately.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we received an email offer from book a table for a three course dinner and a glass of champagne at kaspars seafood bar and grill at the savoy for 39 so we booked a table for 12 of us for a birthday celebration. we were aware that the offer expired on 20th april so booked on this date via book a table. we were then asked to phone the savoy directly to pay a deposit of 20pp, which we did. | on arrival at kaspars, we were shown to our table, but told the offer we had booked was not available to us as we had to eat between 4.30pm-6.30pm or after 9pm. as our table had been booked for 7pm we were told we would have to choose from the a la carte menu instead. we queried this with the waiter and were somewhat surprised given that our booking had been accepted at 7pm and we were not advised of any time restrictions at the time of booking. had we known this, we would of course have booked an earlier table. | when the waiter was unable to assist us, we asked to speak to the manager who was very unhelpful, bordering on being patronising, insisting there was nothing he could do to help us and blaming book a table for the mistake. | after much discussion and believing he was doing us a favour, the manager eventually allowed us to choose from the pre theatre set menu instead of the a la carte menu. this was however, the same menu that finished earlier, without the complimentary champagne and at full price!! the vast majority of the ingredients were on the menu on the offer and it was quite insulting that it was assumed we would not notice this. indeed he actually told us that the chef packs away the ingredients on the deal menu and as we were 30 minutes too late, there was nothing that could be done! | we were all extremely disappointed with the service we received. whilst the mistake was potentially due to book a table and not the savoy directly, our experience was spoilt by the lack of empathy and assistance in honouring our booking which we made in good faith. the manager could have helped us out and perhaps offered us all a glass of wine as a gesture of good will which would have pacified our table. instead, and in his short sightedness, he missed an opportunity to ensure we had a good experience, which we would share with our friends and on social media, and which would have undoubtedly resulted in us spending more on wine/cocktails as a result. this was a far cry from the world class service you would expect from the savoy! | in contrast, we went to the ritz on a similar offer a couple of weeks ago (also booked through book a table) and the service, food and ambiance was wonderful. | we will not be going back to kaspars!'''",0

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we stayed one night for waterloo fireworks. it is so astonished to see a hotel who charged you gbp 800 a night with such a bad service. | 1. hotel sent a pass to get through the restricted area for 31dec, it did not work and you have to wait till someone from the hotel to pick you up. it took me half an hour to get to the hotel and when i mentioned this at check-in counter, a man kept saying it is not their fault and start to raise his voice. i did not want to ruin my night for this stupid argument and mentioned there were still 2 guests outside waiting. guess what, this guy said again ""it is not our fault"". how come it is not your fault when you sent a pass to your customer and your hotel fail at communication with local authority, not to mention you charge 800 for a night and kept your guest waiting in the cold? ""of course it is your bloody fault"" | 2. after the fireworks a disable woman with her family waiting for lift. they had been waiting for like 3 or 4 lifts but could not get on, it is not my business but i still mentioned this to the staff at concierge (concierge is just right at the lift area). ""it will be nice if you can arrange something for them"" the end of conversion was ""are you saying this is my fault? thank you for bring this to me."" of course it is not your fault, but it simply explained how excellent is your service is. at this point i decided not to talk to any staff in this hotel again. | 3. my fault, i had to ring the housekeeping and talk to the staff again for 2 missing toothbrush, no one answered and i had to call the reception desk. after another call and 40 minutes waiting, it finally arrived. this time i told myself that i defiantly not going to say anything again. | overall, i will rate minus 1 if this option exists. this is the best place you can stay for the fireworks, crazy price but wroth your money. you can enjoy the event without any hassle if you get drunk enough to ignore all the things they call service :p'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i do not think i have ever been more compelled to write a review after the humiliating and disgraceful behaviour from the rembrandt hotel. | myself and a friend stayed for one night last week (this was a present for her 18th birthday and we were so looking forward to a weekend in london). | having experienced a wonderful couple of days, we were due to return home on the sunday evening. | when we went to collect our luggage from the hotel, we were told that it had been confiscated and that we would not be getting it back unless we paid the duty manager 50 in cash!!! when we asked why this was so, we were told that we had got some make-up on the bath robes and that this was unacceptable. | i have stayed in numerous hotels all over the world and i have never been faced with such a situation. | the management team refused to give our belongings back (still after 1 hour of discussion) and subsequently we missed the pre-booked train from euston back to birmingham. not only have the hotel completely overstepped the mark by withholding personal property but also put both myself and my friend in a compromising situation where our welfare was in question. | after complaining to both the duty manager and subsequently, my mother, to the general manager, we were given a very short shrift explanation which was not only rude but racially discriminatory. | am i totally misguided in assuming that bathrobes are meant to be worn and that there is a possibility that a few marks may appear on them!!! is not that what washing products are for or am i missing something. | in today's market, when customer service is paramount, the rembrandt falls short in just about every category. | i do not wish to be cynical and assume that perhaps they thought they could get away with taking 50 off two young girls, however, i am pretty confident that had it have been my mother leaving the hotel this would not have happened!!!!!'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''firstly let me say i am proud to be british and love london, but i am the first to admit that twenty years ago england had somewhat of an image problem with its cuisine, wine and hotels. since then there has been a revolution, with some of the finest restaurants and chefs in the world now in the uk and south coast starting to produce wine of a quality to rival some of the best. | hotels in london have undergone a similar transformation. gone are the days where price was no guarantee of quality or cleanliness and more often than not a london hotel could feel like a student dorm room. now the new hotels in every price range have made london one of the best places to stay. | | unfortunately, the mandarin oriental seems to have missed this trend. from the moment you enter the hotel you can tell it has not changed much in a long time, with dcor is that is old, tired and slightly grubby. the staff do their best, and to be honest are exceptional, but that does not take away from the overall feel of the place. where areas have been updated they look great, but this is restricted to the bars and restaurant areas. while on that subject, the mandarin oriental is a great place for a drink and the food is very good, but that is probably where my recommendation would end. | when you get to the room the overall trend continues. i was on the 7th floor and my room was straight out of the 1980s. there were stains on all the chairs and the carpet, the bathroom was in poor condition and there were at least 30 coats of gloss paint on all the window frames, which was chipping off just to add to the overall look. the shower was too low to stand up in and the wardrobes, which at some time in history had obviously been dark wood, were shabbily painted in varying shades of white. on the plus side the bed was clean and comfortable and the hotel was quiet. | so, in summary, the mandarin oriental is not an awful hotel and was at one time probably fantastic. it is in a fabulous location and the staff are great. however, if you are coming to london take the time to see what its hotels really have to offer, its a lot more than this and you will not be disappointed.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''had afternoon tea yesterday with friends. the sandwiches were not traditional and the 'experimentation' combinations were not good. several types had an overpowering quantity of cumin. the other varieties were equally gross. any sandwich from the cafe chain paul would have been infinitely better. the waiter did not seem to know anything about tea either. he poured tea that was under-steeped, over-steeped, and cold. once when pouring piping hot (under-steeped) tea, the pot leaked onto my friend's lap and when it was brought to the waiter's attention he did not even ask if the person was alright. the desserts were disorderly and did not look anything like the photographs shown on the website. food-wise and service-wise the experience was poor. please train the staff better and get a chef in the kitchen who actually knows how to prepare good-tasting sandwiches. apart from being with friends, the only enjoyable part was listening to the pianist.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''my husband and i vacationed here for a week. it is a nice looking hotel in a good location near harrods and lots of other shops. what made the experience not so pleasant was some of the staff members. first of all, we decided to ""upgrade"" our rooms before our arrival. once we checked in we compared our ""upgraded"" room to our other friends' rooms who had also upgraded their rooms and found out we had been lied to. our room in fact was not an upgraded room like we had been told it was. throughout the week we ran into similar ""miscommunications"" with the staff. the final straw was at check out when we asked if we could stay half an hour past check out time for our car to the airport to arrive. the receptionist said it was fine and we again confirmed and double confirmed with her. so at 12:30 when we went to get our luggage from the room, the other receptionist (heather) said that we were late checking out and would be required to pay for another night. our keys to the elevator and room were deactivated. it took another 30 min to straighten things out and we were finally able to get out of there! if the staff was trained on proper communication and better customer service, this could actually be a good hotel.'''",0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we decided to stay at the mandarin oriental in london because we had heard good things about it. | what a disappointment. | it has a thin veneer which appears luxurious and welcoming but our experience there was no better than that we might receive at a motel, in fact it was worse. | our room was run-down and faced onto a building site which had pneumatic drills going all day, our towels were not changed and the furniture was very badly damaged. | some of the staff were very friendly and professional but, in general, they were ignorant and rude. | we were constantly interrogated as to whether or not we were guests of the hotel if we dared to use any of the public areas and random charges were applied to use facilities that we had already paid for. charges, i might add, that were sporadic and illogical. | within minutes of entering the bar, just after we first arrived, we faced a public grilling from the 'security' staff. this made us decide not to use any of the facilities at the hotel if we could possibly avoid it (having already unpacked and being on a tight schedule we were unable to simply change hotels). we even went out for breakfast rather than be embarrassed by the behaviour of the hotel staff. | on our last night we decided to meet some other (more regular) guests in the bar (the hotel does not have a lounge) but were told the bar was full and we could not go in. an acceptable reason you might think but we were then told that we could go in if we paid a cover charge. | obviously this is a new meaning of the word full that i was not previously aware of. | this charge clearly did not apply to all customers so we called the manager of the hotel to complain. | he confirmed our suspicion that the charge applied to non-residents, as is common practice on busy evenings. | having stayed in high quality hotels before, i would have expected this misunderstanding to be dealt with swiftly and discreetly. unfortunately, we had to suffer the spectacle of a heated debate between the manager of the hotel and the bar manager and we were still told that there was a cover charge. | i did not begrudge the nominal fee they were demanding but i did begrudge the fact that the fee was applied so randomly. | i will point out that i was asked three more times if i was prepared to pay the charge, once in front of our friends who, as regular guests, seemed to be even more embarrassed than us. | i am still at a loss as what these random charges and impertinent outbursts are designed to achieve. the hotel certainly was not making much of a profit out of them and they did not seem to prevent anyone from entering the bar which was full. if they were attempting to appear exclusive they overestimate the standard of their bar. although the bar staff themselves were clearly hard working and conscientious, we had to wait far too long to be served. | on each occasion that we were treated in such an appalling manner, we remained polite and composed but the staff seemed to take pleasure in resenting their guests and disregarding our concerns. | the pathetic excuses they gave us beggar belief. we have stayed in numerous luxury hotels around the world and have never before been told, we have to keep asking if you are guests because the wrong people can damage the reputation of the hotel. the outrageous nature of that comment aside, i could not give two hoots about the commercial interests of a hotel that i am paying 400 a night to stay in. apparently, guests are expected to provide free training on customer relations too. as i informed the 'security' staff on numerous occasions during our stay, any complaint can damage the reputation of a hotel. | i might have been able to stomach the constant suspicion if i was not staying at a hotel that uses the words opulent, chic and superb to describe itself. the service certainly does have a style of its own though. | we were bewildered by the whole experience until we discovered that several celebrities were staying at the hotel while we were there. | apparently, because my personal wealth and success is not regularly publicised in the tabloids, my custom was not worth retaining. incredible when i consider that the amount of money we gave to their competitors was almost 3 times what we paid for the room. | but money is not the issue. it would be shallow to just bemoan the fact that i was treated badly even though i am wealthy. i make a point of never beginning a complaint with the phrase ""do not you know who i am?"" because that is simply not relevant. the truth is that every guest should be treated with courtesy and respect no matter how often they appear on the television. the fact that i should even have to point out this basic principle of hospitality takes my breath away. the hotel's choice to make non-celebrity guests feel unwelcome was at best a commercial blunder, at worst ugly discrimination. | needless to say we will not be staying at this poor imitation of a luxury hotel again. i only wish i had packed my bags before staying one night.'''",0

The Dorchester,"'''we popped in here on spec after seeing cirque du soleil nearby at the royal albert hall as we had a few hours spare prior to our train, and were all hungry, and interested to see how the dorchester's tea would differ from the champagne afternoon tea we had the evening before at the savoy. | to our surprise, we were lucky and advised that we could have a table, but not for half an hour. the lady advised us that if we went for a drink in the bar, she would come and get us once our table was ready. | so, we all trapsed to 'the bar at the dorchester' for a stiff drink prior to our cucumber sandwiches, or so we thought . . . | even though there was 1 person mixing cocktails behind the bar, another filling up the nuts or whatever on tables, plus one other bar staff doing not much at all, we were completely ignored when we sat down at a table, and nobody came to take our drinks order. | this went on for 30 mins - we were waiting to see how long it would take before we were acknowledged. just as we were about to walk out in disgust, the nice lady from the promenade came in and advised us our table was ready, so we left, without being served any drink. | i am glad to say that once in the promenade, the whole experience changed, and we enjoyed a delightful afternoon tea consisting of various finger sandwiches on brown and white bread, the infamous jam and cream rain scones, followed by a selection of cakes. | 10 out of 10 to the waiter who even went out of his way to bring us a special selection of vegetarian sandwiches for one of our group. | everything was constantly topped up by the waiter, until we had to ask him to stop as we were full. | the selection of varied teas grown all over the world was too hard to choose from, so i opted for coffee, which i prefer. | in summary, bar service very poor, service in the promenade great. | comparing the two, i think the savoy won, in terms of surroundings, service, quality and choice of food, but not on price. | the service rating is purely due to the lack-lustre performance experienced from the bar staff.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''my husband and i do not seek luxury, and love to save money and do everything cheaply and cheerfully. hostels are not a problem to us. but this ""hotel"" is well beneath the standard of any hostel i have seen. it is a grubby, stained, stale smelling hovel. the room we were given was supposed to be a double, spacious and elegant their website said. it was slightly bigger than the double bed they had in it. there was so much air freshener sprayed in it to mask the stale smell that you could taste it in your mouth. the windows hardly opened. there was no air con. the bathroom was filthy and smelly. 15 minutes we endured in there and most of that was on the mobile trying to book alternative accommodation. they refunded us only 1 night !!!!!!! they have a sign in their entrance room stating that they will not refund, and now i know why. if they refunded everyone who found it impossible to endure they would probably go bust.'''",0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i booked this hotel for a weekend stay i london with my fianc. we stayed in one of the superior rooms which had running water. that is the good points. the water was tepid at best. had it been red wine it would have been the perfect temperature. on the plus side the iron was the same temperature as a dwarf star, regardless of the setting so it all evens out. my shirt is now hipster chic too with a progressive burn mark on the back. maybe they will feature me in vogue? it had plug sockets but i think they were decorative as they certainly were not all functional. the daytime ambiance was that of a jet engine (air con) and a swarm of mosquitos trapped in a megaphone (lights and lamps - this is because your dimmer switches are operating at/over capacity. just remove some lights...i did not want the welcome wagon helicopter from independence day). poor insulation on the doors means you get to hear everything. which is great at 2am when their 12th floor bar empties and people are screaming in the corridor and banging on doors (i cannot blame the hotel for that though). breakfast is also treat with the helpful staff (genuinely) who may need a little help. our waiter, who i shall call manuel for the purposes of the review, kept serving the table next to us with our order. that was when he got what we wanted. ""i would like the lean green cold presse please""...5 mins later, ""sorry we do not have that cold presse, we only have the lean green available""....""great i will have that one then shall i"". i will skip to the end...it never arrived! so in summary if you want to pay top money for a hotel in the area go to the shangri-la down the road!'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i stayed at the mandarin oriental with some family back a few weeks ago from hk. i was hoping to be impressed but things went wrong from the very beginning; to summarise it seems they have poor management/communications with various departments on their end. | my cousin, had made the bookings through american express , whom of which were the ones to make the bookings with the hotel. | we arrived at kings cross hotel, and american express had booked a car from the hotel to pick up the party of 7 people. however after waiting for 15 mins, there was no one there to pick us up. my cousin had contacted ae and they had confirmed thre booking as well as the email confirmation of this all being sent. we had then contacted the hotel to see where the booking was and the hotel staff said no booking was made despite having an email confirmation stating this from ae. whether this was a technical glitch , we will never know but from the offset things were not looking good. my cousin got very irate and admittedly used a rude word to the hotel in his anger but was then greeted back with the same word and the staff hung up the telephone which was pretty shocking too. | upon arrival with our luggage, one suitcase went missing in the hotel (delivered to a wrong room) and upon enquiry of this item we were then told that it was our partys mistake and that it had been left at the taxi rank at kings cross station. according to the hotels pr contact they had accessed cctv camera footage of this happening. highly doubtful due to nature of the circumstance and with data protection laws , this would not have been possible, so some fabricated story was sent our way. none the less, the luggage was found in the end by them.a private room was requested by us to be booked in a neighbouring hotel for a dinner that evening, upon arrival at the neighbouring hotel, no such booking was made, despite a letter confirming this at the time of the booking to our room. | secondly a taxi was booked which was two hours late for a family member. which at the time, the hotel had contacted the recipient to inform them the driver would be 15 mins late due to traffic/road closures which surely this would have been checked/prepared for in advance ( hotel car was ordered 6 hours in advance) no follow up and a further 45 mins passed and no taxi. we had contacted the hotel to check on the whereabouts of the driver and found that he had gone to a different area in london! no follow up apology from the concierge when we arrived either indicating that they were not informed/kept up to date. it is clear that different departments deal with bookings /request and the hotel have no internal communications. | room service various sauces forgotten upon receipt of food in the room perhaps an oversight fine. | a hotel car was booked for the return journey for the family member and we had pushed the car back and room check out by an hour which was accommodated. when the taxi had arrived the hotel concierge contacted our room to inform us of the car as well as to take our time (we had just finished room service meals ) and that it was not a problem , the car would be waiting. 8 minutes past and the family member was called directly by the driver waiting outside, asking how long we would be as he was not able to wait long outside the hotel. not to mention they had also messed up timings for a car to return another family member home with my car! once again, a serious lack of communication somewhere within the hotel. | admittedly staff were friendly when we had arrived and the drinks were complimentary throughout the stay due to the shockingly poor service we had all encountered, quite frankly i would have been happy to pay for the drinks and received a* service ; especially when we had around 6 rooms booked as a party for 5 nights!! | hotel rooms were ok, although i do know the main room/most expensive room booked within the party was old and shower pressure etc seemed like it was on its last legs. | if there are big bookings made within a group /party and various help needed on requests/reservations ( actually a standard requirement which most hotels ought to be able to do ) i do not recommend this hotel at all. very disappointed with this one, annoyingly as its counterparts in other parts of the world seem better!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''this is the third hotel i have stayed at in london in the past few months. this was the least favorite. | good points: we were able to get an early check-in and the front desk attendant was friendly. the concierge was very helpful. the room was immaculate, probably the cleanest hotel room i have been in for years. the location is good. | negatives: we asked three days in a row for our refrigerator to be fixed with no luck. the hotel is so hot we had to have the a/c on constantly. it was incredibly noisy and very ineffectual. the breakfast was awful. the first day the eggs were so hard that they could not be pierced with a fork. all remaining days, the eggs were raw on top. the sausage had some sort of mystery substance in it, the fruit was nasty etc. etc. in five days we were offered coffee only once. we had a room with a 'garden view'. anyone who has been in one of these rooms can attest that the 'garden' is like something out of a monty python skit. we howled.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''this is my first review for tripadvisor but i feel rather strongly about this so have decided to share my viewpoint. i was booked to visit this hotel and unfortunately due to an extremely serious (the most serious) family emergency, i had to change my plans at the last minute, i.e. 10am on the day i was due to arrive. i called the hotel as soon as i knew that i was no longer going to be able to make it and explained that i would not be able to make the booking but that i would gladly rearrange the stay for another time (i am frequently in london). the person i spoke to was friendly but when he asked his manager the reply was utterly ruthless. i would be charged the full night's accomodation as a cancellation fee. | i think it is a shame that the manager does not seem to understand that 5 star service means exceptional service, i.e. treating your customers as exceptions and being accommodating to their needs, especially under difficult circumstances. the funny thing was after informing me that they would have to charge me the full whack as a cancellation fee they then tried to book me in for my next stay!! i politely declined and have just made a booking at another 5 star hotel in london for my new stay. | this is a hotel that is seriously let down by the greed and small-mindedness of the management.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''if you like a cold, sterile, ultra modern hotel then maybe you will like the mondrian more than i did. there was nothing really wrong with anything (except for the bathroom which i will get to in a minute!) i just found it far from welcoming. the bed was very comfy, loved the giant bath sheets and big screen tv. and now the bathroom .... in my opinion it was downright dangerous, way to high and with a very wide ledge, impossible for me to climb into. if my sister and brother in law had not been in the room opposite mine and were happy for me to use their walk in shower which, by the way was super slippy but we solved that by putting the bathmat inside the cubicle to stand on safely while in the shower, i would have had to ask for a room change. i have not mentioned the staff, i guess they were okay ... really did not have anything to do with them once i would checked in so did not form an opinion. oh, one last thing ... i hated the black and pink splot on the wall, maybe it is just my imagination but, it kind of looked like a rather rude anatomical shape!'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the hotel is in a lovely area, very clean. the room was ok, clean and functional. the ensuite is small but as expected in a building of this age. check in went smoothly, we were even able to check in a bit early. lots of stairs as peope have said, but not too taxing (i have lower limb injuries). when we went to leave on the first day the lock on our door was broken but by the time we return it was fixed. bed was ok, but the pillows were like rocks. room was cleaned while we were out for the day and was sparkling clean when we returned, with the beds made and everything topped up. silly little thing but there were 3 spare toilet rolls in the bathroom cupboard which makes a nice change from having just 1 for 3 people. breakfast room is very cramped, but there is a nice choice for continental breakfast included and as much toast, tea and coffee as you can consume. the staff were very attentive and friendly. my only real critisism is that on the sunday morning we recieved a phone call from reception at 8.30am saying that the room below had complained about the noise coming from our room. i was in the shower and my husband was in the bedroom with our little girl. she had seen something she loved on tv and had jumped about in excitement. after the phone call she was very very upset and was scared to move around incase she was 'told off'. if this had happened at 5am or around that time then yes, i would accept this was early, but not at 8.30, especially when the breakfast service starts at 7.30. i was woken during the night by people talking loudly as they went upstairs, but i did not phone and complain as it is all part and parcel of staying in a hotel.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''just attempted to check into my 2000 pre-paid suite while i wait for my husband to arrive. because i do not carry a credit card and because my name is not on the booking i have been turned away. i am now looking forward to a three/four hour wait and quite frankly would rather sleep in a bin. | rating would be zero if it was an option.''',0
The Savoy,"'''having brought along my confirmation and showed them at check-out, they tried to put the price up and add another 20% to the price. they did not say sorry about moving the price up - and insisted against my wishes- on adding 20% to the agreed price. lucky to be in the top 100 in london. i will not stay there again and i will not stay at the fairmont chain of hotels either. i have never ever experienced this before and i have visited 120 countries. this is only hotel review. you have been warned. the manager could not have been less interested. go back to school young man and learn some manners.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''me and my friends wanted to celebrate our friends birthday by treating her to a spa day. after researching on spa websites we chose the rembrandt, as knitsbridge is a lovely part of london and the pictures on the website looked great. we were expecting a relaxing spa day in a quality spa. me and my friends were highly disappointed with the quality of the rembrandt 'spa'. the website makes the pool area look lovely however it does not show you that you have to walk past the gym which is right next to the pool and that there are children have swimming lessons. | so half the pool is un available. we were told that jacuzzi jets were not working and when i dipped my foot in the water, it was luke warm and not very inviting. the 'relaxation area' was shocking, it consisted of two beds where you cannot relax when it is not quiet. we were then shown to the sauna and steam room which where in the gym changing rooms, they were extremely small. cleanliness was not great, the robes and slippers given to us were itchy and uncomfortable. the safe within the lockers did not work either. the lady that showed us around was friendly but not that helpful, we did not know what times our treatments were and where we had to go. after being shown around me and my friends discussed about the quality of the spa and that the service we were given did not make a good first impression. we agreed we would like a refund as we did not want to use any of the facilities, as they were not appealing. i was very upset as it was my friends birthday treat which turned out to be a big disappointment! | i did speak to the manager to ask for a refund, i explained that after looking around and discovering it was really only just a gym and not a spa day at all. and how we had travelled for more than a hour, expecting a relaxing day. he said that there is a no refund policy and the best he could do is offer a free day pass to come back(which did not include any treatments) when the jets on the jaccuzi works, we did not take this! i feel that they should not be advertised on a spa website. i would not recommend the rembrandt if you are looking for a spa day out. we left feeling strongly disappointed and mislead.'''",0
London Guest House,"'''when i arrived, i was greeted by a very nice and friendly gentleman. that was my only positive experience at this dumpy place. ok, the location is reasonable. it is about a 10-15 minute walk from acton main line (overground station - zone 3) which is the first stop and 6 minutes from paddington station. it is also about a mile from acton town underground station which is on the piccadilly line to heathrow. these are the distressful things about this place: (1) the ""hotel"" is in one of those typically tiny row houses in a london suburb. it is old and dumpy looking. (2) the room is very small. i was in a single with a double bed which occupied almost the whole room. if there are two of you, you would have to take turns moving about while one of you sits or lies on the bed. if you are more than average size, you may be stuck between the foot of the bed and the wall. you step out of your bed and you are a stumble away from the bathroom. (3) the bathroom can induce a severe bout of claustrophobia. the shower curtain is one of those cheap plastic contraptions that tend to get grungy in a few days. and it was, because it looks as though it has been in use for a while but never cleaned. unfortunately, the shower stall is so small, it was a challenge trying to avoid being wrapped in the shower curtain while taking a shower. (4) the size of the sink is one that would traumatize a pygmy chihuahua into a claustrophobic fit. it is barely functional. (5) you get a little sachet of shampoo and soap. i did not finish my soap and left the unfinished sachet on the sink top. the cleaner removed it the next day and did not replace it. it was late when i returned that night and i was already in the shower so i could not be bothered toweling my self and going out to reception to ask for soap. so i used the remaining shampoo instead. (6) the noise. from inside and outside. the busy road is only a few steps away and you can hear traffic all night. walls and ceilings are paper thin. you hear all kinds of sounds including voices, tv, and people closing doors and walking upstairs. (7) the warm miniature fridge. the web site specifically mentioned the rooms have fridges so i had bought some cheese. i had also intended to get other things to put in the fridge. unfortunately, it was not working. the light was on but it was not cooling and there were no knobs or controls anywhere. i brought this up to the person on duty at the reception at that time. this guy seems to be genetically incapable of smiling (i had seen him earlier in the breakfast room when he replenished the food and drinks and interacted with some of the guests - no smiles!). his demeanor is more suitable for a position in a funeral parlour. anyway, he promised to have it looked into. when i returned at night, it had not been fixed. so i asked him about it. he told me someone had come to fix it. if that is true, he obviously did not bother to check. funeral parlour apologized profusely but that did not help my cheese and other stuff that i had bought. (8) somewhat minor, but it betrays a poor work attitude - my bed was sloppily made the next day. half of the sheet was tucked in and the other half was sticking out loosely. presumably, this was the work of the same person who did not replace the soap. (9) at best, the wifi is only average in terms of speed and reliability (sometimes fast, sometimes quite slow; sometimes have to try a couple of times to get connection). i understand that reviews are subjective but for this place to have been awarded a certificate of excellence is absolutely mind boggling and extremely disturbing to say the least.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''5 of us went for a treat to the cocktail bar to celebrate my wife's birthday. we were told to wait in the american bar until a table become available. i bought a bottle of wine to share while we waited - 45.00 plus 5.75 compulsory tip for just drawing the cork!! i could have bought the same wine from any supermarket for 4.99!! | 30 minutes later we were shown to a cramped table. 2 of us were sitting just facing a blank wall. the music was so loud that we could hardly hear ourselves speak. the room was so dark that we had trouble reading the cocktail menu. the basic cocktail price was 15.00 plus tip, so a round of 5 cost 86.25. the drinks looked very pretty, but were basically just glasses full of ice cubes with a few sips of liquor. the cocktail waitress did not give a single smile and her service was very abrupt. | this place is just living on a very old reputation. the entrance is undoubtedly beautiful, but their pricing is ripping off tourists and out of town visitors and not doing any good for london's reputation.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''here is a bit about why i only give it 2 stars. the price is high and these things were poor. it took hours and hours to simply get 4 bottle of waters delivered to the room. when they came to clean they took one of the robes and never brought a fresh one, the concierge could not get even one dinner reservation for us and it was a tuesday night and we were only looking to pubs. nothing was up to par, the hotel i snot in a good location for being able to enjoy local cafes or bars or shopping either. oh, and the king size bed was maybe a double'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i am a front office manager in a 5 diamond establishment and this hotel is just dreadful. we arrived at 5pm and had to wait for our room which was not ready!! we arrive in the room - standard of cleanliness disgusting. service at breakfast was a joke, we had to ask for tea and coffee (which was tepid in temperature) and toast. the most ridiculous thing of all is that you have to pay to use the leisure facilities!!!!! over all this hotel is the worst that i have ever stayed in and i would not recommend it to anyone...quite shocking really!'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''london was the last leg of our journey on a trip around europe. we had both lived in london before and knew that the location would be great for shopping and catching up with friends. | we arrived late in the afternoon and the check in was perfunctory at best but to be honest i did not really mind that. however from the first morning we had no hot water or internet. i was lied to by the person we talked to about this and told this was a room wide problem. however the myriad of service men that came in and out of our room replacing tap fittings etc in our room only did not seem to make that the case. hot water was fixed but 11am but not a great start to a busy hoilday we had planned. all we were told was sorry, these things happen. | day two i was getting changed in my room and a service man walked into our room without knocking. i could not be bothered even complaining as i felt nothing would have been done about it. | we stayed for a total for 4 nights and every day there was construction in a room opposite us which meant constant banging, sawing and hammering. not exactly relaxing. | the hotel was in an excellent location but 4 star this was definately not. i would not recomend this.'''",0
Newham Hotel,"'''there are some good points to this hotel, the location is great for public transport links. the number 86 bus stops right outside the hotel and runs frequently all day and night. the free parking and breakfast were great as we only paid 32.50 per night, fantastic price for a stay in london. the beds were comfy enough and the room appeared to be clean. the staff all seemed to be friendly and helpful and the vending machine came in handy, although there is a garage and a mcdonald's opposite the hotel too. | however there quite a few downfalls to our stay. firstly we had to ask for more towels and another remote for the tv when we arrived. the light bulbs all went out one by one during our 2 night stay so we had to get the handyman to change them. as soon as he did, one went out again but no big drama. on the friday night we lost water pressure in our bathroom so we could t flush the toilet. it also meant that we had no cold water so could not get a shower (unless you wanted to be scalded) and had to use bottled water to brush our teeth. luckily there was a communal shower room and toilet at the end of the corridor so we used that instead. the water issues only got fixed late on saturday night after another couple of visits from the handyman. | during our stay the weather was very hot and humid. as there was no air con throughout the hotel, our room was extremely uncomfortable. we had the window open all the time but this did not help at all. we felt like we were melting the whole time we were there. | we had a bag of snacks with us (crisps/chocolate bars) which we did not touch whilst we were there. when we got home and emptied it, it seems like we had furry companions in our room with us that had helped themselves to our snacks!! not great and looking at other reviews on here it would seem that the place has a major mouse problem which really needs to be rectified. | our friends were put in the other building which is a converted block of flats. to be completely honest, the block looks like a crack den!! not at all welcoming and the whole place is in dire need of renovations. | all in all, for the price we put up with it but do not think we would return unless we really could not find anywhere else to stay.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''we were very disapointed in our room we booked six months in advanced. our view from the window was a metal building which was so close to the window it practically blocked out any day light. waiter had brought the coffee tray in case we wanted a coffee, we were astonished after we could not find any sight of any coffee maker in the room. we dialled down and was told 'someone will bring it right away' now this is no exaggeration, after two more telephone calls and two hours later they finally brought us a coffee pot. | i began to wonder was it became we had purchased one of those vouchers as we had a bad experience in the kaspers restaurant with very rushed service.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i booked a stay at the rembrandt for one night (12 june) through the british airways website, at the same time as booking my flight. there was a good room rate, comparatively speaking (130 b&amp;b), and the reviews of the hotel seemed good. this was a brief business trip to london. | anyway when i arrived at the hotel around 2.30 pm, the hotel manager told me that they had had problems, apparently of their own making, which had meant the hotel was heavily overbooked and that they did not have a room for me. he had booked me in a hotel close by (""also a 4 star"", he stated) and they would pay for a taxi to take me straight there. given that i had a meeting to attend at 4 pm i did not make a fuss and accepted mistakes can happen. so i was then despatched to the regency hotel close by. it is pretty tired it has to be said, not a four star but rather a three star, and while the basics of my stay were delivered i.e. i managed to get a decent night's sleep in a comfy bed, it was not a four star experience. | so while the hotel manager at the rembrandt was very apologetic and assured me i would get an upgrade if i returned , i do not think i will be going back. if i was to go again, i would certainly make a point of calling a day or two before arriving to receive an assurance there was no problem. the thing which irritated me was the misrepresentation, which i accept may have been innocent, that the hotel i was being offered in substitution was equivalent class or standard . | so this may have been a complete one-off for them, never to be repeated, but be careful........'''",0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this hotel is nothing more that ok. for the price it is not like we were expecting it to be fancy so we were not surprised when we got there and realized that it was not. we had a room with the bathroom en suite. the bathroom was spotless and roomy enough to shower in comfort. | the room was also spacious enough for comfort and despite the old carpets at first glance appeared to be clean. the sheets were clean but when i checked the comforter was filthy...filled with hair and goodness knows what else from previous guests! in fact it was so dirty that i refused to to sllep with it on the bed resulting in a pretty cold night for london in the winter! the matress was like sleeping on a box of rocks and my back truly ached me for the next few days. | the breakfast left a lot to be desired. the location was great for a budget hotel. just a 10 minute walk from covent garden and the start of the high action areas. the houston street tube station is just a 4 minute walk which was also nice. but i will never stay there again! we are never looking for fancy just a clean place and a good night sleep when we get back to the room. the ridgmount was spotless in some senses and flithy in others and there was not one good night of sleep to be had there! if you are brave enough to try it then make sure to ask for a room with the bathroom ""en suite"" otherwise you will be sharing with others in the hall.'''",0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i had booked a night in mondrian london as a surprise getaway for my partner's birthday. given the good reviews and 5* rating, i had high hopes for this hotel but we have left feeling very disappointed. our check in was a long and arduous process, left waiting for 10-15 minutes with the reception understaffed, the card machine was broken and they had run out of key card holders so were just given our hotel keys in a plain envelope. the room was basic, and definitely not 5* luxury. there were no dressing gowns, very poor tea and coffee making facilities, nowhere to sit to do hair/make-up forcing you to sit on the floor in front of the mirror - and generally a bit tatty and budget (like a nice premier inn!) the toilets in the restaurant were also quite unpleasant, dirty and not what you would expect from either a high-end restaurant or hotel. | we did use the dandelyon bar, and had breakfast in the hotel and were impressed with both. the service was very good and, although expensive, food and drinks were delicious. | the check out experience was also difficult, a long wait and a tokenistic offer of a drinks voucher when voicing my dissatisfaction with the stay - even though none of the bars were even open. the hotel was absolutely not worth the 175 a night price tag or the 5* rating, and i have stayed in much nicer hotels with much better service that are 3* and 4*. i wished we had returned to the hilton bankside where we had stayed last year, which was much more luxurious and 100% worth it.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''this was the first stop on a 3 week holiday in europe for my mom's birthday. we stayed for 4 nights and initially booked a superior room but it was too small for my comfort so upgraded to a luxury room which was more spacious. the initial superior room given was ornately decorated in a palatial manner but felt very cramped. i found the luxury room to be more comfortable so if you value space like myself, the superior should be avoided. | check in was rather mechanical though they did allow me to view other available options. i mentioned that we were celebrating my mum's birthday which happens to fall on our third day there but there was absolutely no recognition of it. i am a premier member of the fairmont loyalty program but it made no difference to the stay. i guess there was heightened expectations of my stay here this time round since my first stay was excellent, especially with an upgrade to a luxury double room. the previous stay felt a lot more personalised. | the positives: | hotel is well maintained and location was superb. the rooms are beautifully appointed and i like the separate bath and shower. we took the bus and walked a lot so its proximity to attractions and the bus stop was very convenient. the tube station felt like a quite a walk away given that there seems to be a stop on early every block. | i used the gym which i found to be adequate and there was an indoor pool which was nice, if not small. i enjoyed cocktails at the american bar and we had a delightful server who was very helpful in helping us with the menu. the only other positive encounter i had with staff there was the evening turn down housekeeper, amelia, who had very good attention to detail. the day housekeeping team did not bother to fold my pjs which i had draped over the bench at the front of the bed. neither did they arrange my toiletries on the bathroom sink which i have come to expect of luxury hotels. but amelia noticed this and when we came back in the evening, it was good to notice that she had corrected the above. this happened every day of our stay so suffice to say that the evening housekeeping team is far more competent than the day team. | a major annoyance was that the wifi seem to disconnect after some time (24 hours i think, not too sure) and having to reconnect every time during a 5 day stay was very irritating. they should consider a multi day option connect function so i do not have to keep reconnecting on all my devices. | the biggest crime i find here is that they charge for things that should be complimentary in a hotel that deems itself as a luxury property. during check in, i was asked if i would like any newspaper so i requested for the inyt as well as the the telegraph. upon checkout, i was shocked to find 'newpaper revenue' in the bill. i indicated that i was not made aware that i was going to be charged for newspaper and that the check in staff should have informed us if there was going to be extra. the check out receptionist subsequently waived it off. | it was extremely distasteful that a hotel like the savoy should resort to charging its guests for newspaper, a service i consider standard in a hotel of its stature. worst still, they had the audacity to charge for the telegraph which is a local newspaper! also, if you want to use the business centre, be prepared to pay except to print boarding passes. i cannot imagine why they would charge for internet access if you use their computers and i have never seen anything like this in all my travels except when i was a broke student backpacking in hostels. even so, the better ones provided free use of their computers! i am not sure if this is standard practice in the uk or perhaps i have been spoiled by asian hospitality. | i found the service and facilities to be sorely lacking which made a stay in a luxury 5 star property like this to profoundly disappointing. i know these are all first world problems and it sounds entitled but there are expectations to be met. it is the savoy afterall. i travel extensively for leisure and most of it in 5 star hotels so i left feeling very disenchanted that i did not get to show my mum the best of london. definitely not going to return. i would consider a stay there solely for its historic significance an acceptable reason if you do not mind mediocre service. otherwise, look elsewhere.'''",0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we arrived at the hotel, to be told we would be staying in the annex, this is not a property connected to the main hotel, it is located about five mins walking, up a street &amp; around a corner. | our room, was really cold, this we did not realise until the middle of the night, i got up to switch the heating on to no avail, the air con only blew cold air. | we realised that there was 24 hour reception in the main hotel, who we could connect by telephone, but we were to females, who did not want any body wandering around our bedroom in the middle of the night. | so my daughter slept in a jumper, i used my coat as an extra blanket. | no extra blanket supplied in any of the drawers. | the room was clean, bed comfortable, shower good. | the decor needs updating. | breakfast is served in the main hotel, luckily it was not raining, we arrived to find no tables available, so had a bit of a wait. | the breakfast room is too small to accommodate two hotels, one tiny room. | breakfast was included in the price. | the staff were very helpful. | if you wish a cooked breakfast it is an extra charge. | you could have as much toast as required, cereal, tea, coffee, fruit juice. | would i stay again no, mainly because we were in the annex, it would of been dreadful if it had been raining, the walk for breakfast. | just make sure you do not stay in the annex.'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''i have travelled internationally several times, and like many independant, budget-minded travelers i will gladly sleep in ""questionable"" hostels, hotels, and guesthouses. over time, i have found my tolerance for imperfection to be much higher than most. however, a to z hotel was by far the worst place i have ever stayed in. my husband and i booked one night at a to z hotel online, and when we arrived around 11:00pm, the front door was locked and we had to pound on the glass door to wake up the sleeping person in the lobby area. after letting us in, he called upstairs for another man to check us in. when he finally came downstairs, i got the distinct impression this person had also been asleep. the room was disgusting: the carpet and bed linens smelled musty and dirty, the bathroom was moldy, and the windows were broken. we only stayed the night because it was already so late, and we had no internet access to locate an alternative. also, the walk back to the metro station (and potential wifi hotspot) would have taken another 30 minutes. please do not stay in this hotel!'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the positives are the restaurants. bar boulud is fabulous and having breakfast on the terrace overlooking the park was great. | the negatives are the rooms. they are ridiculously tired. not old and charming. just old. this hotel is coasting on the mandarin oriental name. i have stayed at the mo in sf, barcelona, munich and nyc and they are all much better hotels. | i assume that the london mandarin oriental meets the technical definition of a 5 star hotel, but i never stayed in a 5 star room that was so bad. our room, 725, booked on the amex fine hotels and resorts had a door that when locked you could still see a ton of daylight from the hallway. it did not look substantial or safe even when locked. the bed was the most uncomfortable bed i have slept on. it was solid as a rock with absolutely no give. there was a ""japanese nightingale"" floor outside the door where you could hear the creaking floors of everyone who walked by the room. the carpet and furnishings were worn. the bathroom was uncomfortably minuscule and ugly. it looked like they slapped on some new marble and fixtures and left the old ugly mirror, ceiling fixtures and obscure window. | the gentleman who escorted us to our room claimed that this one of their best courtyard rooms (which are supposed to be quieter than other rooms, but the view is of a light well shaft). | i was excited to stay at this hotel because it is so beautiful from the outside and the location is great. i was not a fan. | in prior stays i have stayed at the berkeley, the savoy and the connaught. they are all much better than the mandarin oriental london.'''",0
The Lanesborough,"'''i was invited to breakfast here by a colleague and had great expectations. however i was very disappointed in the standard of food provided. i had chosen pancakes and bacon with maple syrup which consisted of one lonely pancake in the centre of the plate with some deep fried bacon (hard as a rock) on top. ignoring the price for a moment because it is a beautiful dining room with excellent service, but quality, quantity and presentation was very poor for that standard of hotel. a bit lazy to be honest.'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''i have been to this place before and as you can read on my previous review, the food was ok but there were some issues. | this time i went back for lunch to the lounge bar to see if there were any improvements but there were not any. | the starters were served with the main course (just like in a pub) also without any cutlery (how am i supposed to eat pasta??). the table was so tiny that we had to use the table next to us to fit the plates. it was freezing cold in the bar. no coasters for the drinks. i had to ask for the lemon to put inside my coke. | never give a second chance!'''",0
A To Z Hotel,"'''is this hotel some kind of joke?! believe all the terrible reviews and do not stay here! it is a dump, an utter hole and not worth a cent a night!! | where shall i start........... | - the website for this hotel states ""newly refurbished"" .... i can absolutely guarantee this place has never been refurbished and is literally falling apart! | - my room was so small that the desk and wardrobe literally block 3/4 of the grotty bed so you have to squeeze through the gap between them to get into bed! | - there was not enough room to actually lie my suitcase down to get clothes out, the suitcase had to stand up the whole time making it very difficult to get anything out and then i had to climb over it to get between the bed and the door! even then the door still hit my suitcase and i had to squeeze through the gap to get out! and please note, i am tiny and found the space a struggle!! | - the bed is right up against the heater so you cannot turn it on at a risk of setting the whole building on fire (not sure if that is a bad thing though)!! | - my quilt was covered in stains and was so old it was falling to pieces. | - the walls and carpet were filthy dirty, covered in stains, marks, cracks and peeling paint! | - the ""fan"" is a portable fan mounted to the wall, not a ceiling fan! it is also so full of dust that when turning it on causes the room to fill with dust and grime | - the shower and drains are covered in mould and have not been cleaned in years! the shower curtain is also mouldy and i would advise to wear thongs in the shower! if you dare stay that is!! | - i found black hair throughout the bathroom and my sheets! i am blonde so clearly this had not been removed from the previous person who stayed! | - found spiders in my room, which i killed, however there remains stayed on the carpet as the cleaners failed to vacuum at all! | - the bathroom is so small that my knees were in the shower whilst on the toilet! | - the bathroom exhaust fan was so noisy it was hardly bearable. however as the light above the mirror did not work, i had to have the exhaust fan on whenever using the mirror as its attached to the main light! | - the walls are paper thin, you will be able to hear the people in the next room crying at the terrible state of the hotel! | - breakfast is 2 pieces of plain toast and a home-brand cup of tea or coffee, despite a sign advising of juice and other goodies! and to top it off it is served in the greasy takeaway restaurant next door!? | - the reception is dirty! the stairs are sagging and carpet is filthy! | - cleaners walk in without knocking! always fun when you are standing there in your underwear! privacy, who pays for that?!? | - the closest train station is the national railway and if you want to get to the metro you either need to take the national railway back to earling broadway or take a hike to the metro station, which is not close by! i did not investigate buses so there may be a quicker alternative if you look into it. | - neighbourhood is awful! if you are a girl on your own, be very careful! | my list could go on and on... however i think i have made my point! | photos have been included in this review so you can see the state of the hotel!'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we have been staying at the corinthia a few times, probably 4 or 5 in the past year. our impressions are mixed. large rooms and comfortable beds plus 24 hours check-in policy are the main reason why we return. however, we do not feel welcome at this hotel. i will not go into details of our prior stays, which on some occasions involved complains and, to be honest, in most cases adequate mitigating measures by the hotels management. i would like to share some impressions about our most recent (and current) stay: 1. we arrived at around 6.30am. although our luggage (quite a few suitcases) was handled flawlessly, reception was confused about our reservations (we have another one for next week) and we were not offered to be escorted to the room; we saw in the afternoon the hotels staff escorting other guests, which made us feel like second-class. 2. our main phones were not working when we arrived and despite numerous efforts and pointless visits from specialists (who basically unplugged the phones and plugged them in again the same thing i did myself in the first place) are still not functioning, some 14 hours since we arrived, so we have to go to the toilet (the only place where the phone works) to order room service and make/receive other calls not a normal thing. 3. ac unit was not working properly at a minimum +18c (64.5f) blowing warm air; after we complained about it another specialist came to basically identify that it was blowing air at +25c (77f) and adjust the settings to allow the unit to be set at +15c the lowest instead, which helped somewhat, but has not turned things around (if a bit cooler, the air is still stuffy) we go to bed opening the window a bit to let some fresh air in. 4. not a critical mass, but we had robes, towels and slippers for two people, while the reservation clearly states 4 adults and they knew our estimated arrival time. this happened to us before, and in other hotels also, but i think on at least few occasions the corinthia did it right, so its definitely a deviation from past good practice. | these are all trivial details of our current experience. the main thing is that i went to the reception in person to talk about our main problems with the manager on duty julian, who as i understood was planning to come to our room to discuss the situation instead he opted to call making me to go to the toilet (as that is the only place where the phone works) to tell me that the phone is an external problem and would be fixed eventually and that they blow all available cold air into our room. it was quite surreal to stare at the toilet bowl and hear some meaningless explanations of why things do not work. to that i could only say thank you and write this review.'''",0
Hartley Hotel,"'''upon arrival we realised hotel was abit dingy but we perserved as room was non r efundable, there was a used condom on window sill, dirty stained bed base and a horrible stench in our room but not wanting to create a fuss happily strolled to poundland round the corner to buy air freshners to make it more tolerable....well upon bedding down for the night my husband was itching but i thought he was just being paranoid until he screamed to put the light on as he ft something crawl across his face and saw something moving and yup you guessed it bedbugs so off to reception we go and the man said 'not had reports of bedbugs in that room before', we said we wanted a refund and to leave but was denied as we were offered alternative room less than 10 meters away fron the current one which we politley declined, so our halfterm with 2 small children amd numerous trips booked has been ruined and we had to drive 3 hours home as no other hotel could accomodate us in the small hours, when calling to chase refund this morning the hotel are now denying they have a problem.health hazard which i will be repoting to enviromental health.this place needs torching!!!'''",0

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''after getting back home and realizing we had forgotten my daughter's stuffed toy in a rush to check out of the hotel, i immediately called up the hotel to inquire about my daughter's toy. in other hotel's i have stayed in, they would have immediately posted any lost property back to me, however, in this instance all i had in response was ""we will call you back when we find it"". it really would not be that hard to find as the toy was fairly large and would have been on the bed where we were sleeping. of course, we did not get a callback and so when i called again, all they had to say was ""sorry it is not there"". unless someone in their housekeeping is a thief, it is virtually impossible for an item to magically disappear in under 24 hours. i am immensely disappointed as my daughter has had that toy since the day she was born.'''",0

City View Hotel,"'''i understand this is one of a group of low end hotels, which never fail to disappoint. on arrival i was asked for cash for my stay of several nights, to which i said i did not carry large amounts. then i was directed to their own atm machine in the corner of reception. i pointed out that this charged 1 &amp; they them offered to refund the 1, it then took 10mins for them to ask every member of staff if they had a to give me. | the room was fair &amp; at the back of the building which was quiet, could not ajust the shower head so had to stand about 5ft away to get wet. not a good area, pay a little more as there are far better places around the area.'''",0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''i took my 18 year old daughter for a night stay. the hotel is very tired and in desperate need of repair. we ate out the evening of our stay but we did have a lovely breakfast the next morning. you are paying five start money for a 3 star environment . | to add to a disappointing visit we were woken at 6 am with a adult male beating up two women . when i called reception they sent security who then informed me that it was a family dispute and the girls did not want to press charges . | after that upset all my daughter wanted was to go home ... at reception we had the wi-fi taken off the bill as a good will gesture . all very disappointing we will not return.''',0

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''on arrival we were greeted by friendly staff of this amazingly decorated hotel. we checked in and strangely the receptionist took an extra 150 off my card for ""extras"" i may have! which i found very rude and almost untrusting of their guests who pay a substantial price to stay. | we had a deluxe room on the 7th floor which is stunning. very clean, tidy and impressive with all the usual mod cons. however you would at least expect a complimentary bottle of water ! nope they want you to pay 4. | the windows are a death trap ! if you have got young kids keep them away! ours was unlocked and the restrictors removed. | we booked a food safari ! big big mistake. we started a massimo's where we were put in the corner with one plate of cold meats (still on a sheet of cardboard) with stale bread! service was shocking to say the least. after complaining we were then ushered away to the other restaurant. the service was much better but the food was sub standard. we both had steak which simply is something you would cook on a week night at home. very very poor. | great hotel but do not eat here! | i have been to many top end restaurant and hotels in london. | drinks hugely over priced.'''",0
The Savoy,"'''i never expected anything but a sensational stay at the savoy in london, and could not believe when my husband and i went from one bad experience to another in the hotel. we arrived saturday noon to find that every restaurant in the hotel was fully booked for lunch. ditto for afternoon tea. sunday morning we came down for breakfast at 10 am only to be herded into the black bar to wait for an available breakfast table. while we waited in the dark, we were not even offered free access to the hotel's wi-fi. it took us 1:25 minutes to have breakfast, and my waffle order was only 2 x 2-inch waffles! i thought i was rationed. we left the hotel for some xmas shopping and returned at 3:30 pm to find that our hotel room still had not been done! we went downstairs to the bar (forget having high tea, remember, that is fully booked!) to have tea while we waited for our room to be cleaned, and the barmaid forgot to place our order. 40 minutes later, and an apology, we were served tea. | i would like to end on a good note. the doormen are very nice and efficient. | susie hafner'''",0
The Rembrandt,"'''its an okay hotel, good location, room nice. | i stay in a lot of hotels, and a lot in london. | i have had card impressions etc taken, but here you have to pay the 50 in advance for 'extras' even if your room is paid in full in advance. your cc is then reimbursed when you check out. | means, of course you have to queue to check out and then make sure your card is recredited. it is also a bit cheap if you ask me. | must be a hotel where they get a lot of untrustworthy people. i do not like it.'''",0
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''fantastic location, particularly if you are wanting to visit all the tourist spots in london. we visited for my wifes 50th birthday. hotel were great in organising our visit, the admin team were fantastic. | my wife used the espa spa, which is also stunning and had 2 treatments. kindly they gave us a great upgrade to a lovely room. so why only 2 stars? | dinner was just not good enough, we ate in the northhall, and the food was only ok.....we expected so much more. also my wife became very ill whilst we were at the hotel. whilst i am sure they were not to blame and helped as much as they could, i was felt really let down with how they dealt with elements of her illness. in particular really surprised that despite writing a letter to the general manager, we have still not heard anything back. just not what you expect from a 5 star hotel costing this much money. | so as the heading says i really want to be so much more positive with the hotel, but just cannot write a review that says that based on my experience.'''",0

London Guest House,"'''my wife and i visited the london guest house b&amp;b from june 28-30 2017. overall it was a pleasant experience, and we would recommend it. | the rooms were small - as is typical for london - but clean and comfortable. while we were traveling as a couple this time around, we thought there would be enough space in the rooms had we brought our 2 kids with us. to note, you do need to climb a number of stairs up a narrow hallway to get to the rooms. | a few days before we visited, i contacted the lgh and they sent me a little package over email of how to get to the b&amp;b from our airport. it was a nice package that we appreciated and referenced throughout our stay. i am not sure if everyone gets it, or if its only upon request, but it was appreciated nonetheless. | lgh served a standard continental breakfast - it was good quality. | the owners/staff were very friendly and accommodating. an example of this is when we first arrived at noon, after having flown in on the red-eye from toronto, we were hoping that we could check in early and take a nap before our concert that evening at wembley stadium. while our room was not ready yet, they allowed us to immediately check into a different room and actually let us stay in that room for the evening and overnight. the next morning, they moved our bags into the correct room for the remainder of our stay. it was a great touch that allowed us to better enjoy our evening, and a nice service that was appreciated! | the b&amp;b is located in north acton, and while not close to a tube station, is accessible by transit with a combination of tube and bus. the bus stop is about a 3-4 minute walk from the b&amp;b. the bus that runs in front of lgh runs 24 hours, with a bus coming every 5-15 minutes depending on the time of day. it is about a 45-60 minute travel time to central london. | there is a small grocery store about a 5 minute walk down the main road, and a convenience store across the street. there is not much else of note in the immediate area of lgh, mainly residential homes. | overall, we were pleased with our stay at lgh.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we visited the hotel as a mid week break and were looking forward to wandering around the local area, exploring pubs and local eateries. however, the hotel, its restaurant and cocktail bars were so good that we did not need to venture out! the room was quirky, well equiped, clean abd had an incredible view of the city. the cocktail bar was fascinating, the drinks very original, the staff so positive and professional, and the atmosphere so very vibrant. in conclusion a wonderful hotel, not cheap by any stretch of imagination but worth every penny in my opinion....now saving up for next years' trip!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''an impressive hotel with a premium location. expensive and exclusive and a bit stuffy. we stayed here for a week and were most impressed with the large room and closet and beautifully appointed bath. the corinthia does the big things well. fine dining, high tea, crafted cocktails, custom sound system, beautiful marble bath, huge rain shower, comfortable beds and beautiful linens and a very nice staff. the little things, not so good. sinks would not drain, hot and cold water taps did not work properly, shower door stop broken, and an ac unit that made weird random noises. all small maintenance things that really detracted from the experience. you want a custom chocolate in a fancy corinthia box at turn down? no problem. it is complimentary. you want a bottle of drinking water? get our your wallet for the mineral water in the mini bar or order it from room service or bring your own. you want a rain shower that is the most luxurious shower you have ever taken? they have got it. you want the sinks to drain or the shower door to close properly? nope. beautiful flowers. lots of marble. doormen in top hats. it was fun, but it felt to us that someone has fallen a sleep at the wheel. they are so busy trying to impress you with the big things they do, they have forgotten to keep an eye on the little things that matter most.'''",2

The Dorchester,"'''everyone should have the opportunity to stay at such a lovely hotel. part of a collection of hotels, i have had the good fortune to stay at the beverly hills hotel, hotel belair, and 45 park lane but the dorchester is my absolute favorite. its a 5-star establishment on every level - environment/decor, location, restaurants and bars, but the very best thing about the dorchester is the people. i have travelled far and wide and have never stayed at such an exquisite hotel that also had the friendliest, most professional and helpful staff. my husband has stayed here 5-6 times/ year for the past few years on business and he will not stay anywhere else. they greet him by name on arrival. they have upgraded our room to a larger suite when they knew i was traveling with him. the bar managers greet him warmly when we stop in for a cocktail before dinner - they are truly happy to see him. it feels like you are part of an exclusive club yet anyone staying at the hotel is in the club. | all of the restaurants are fantastic. during our most recent stay we tried the champagne afternoon tea which was delightful but more food than we could possibly eat. at the end of our meal our waiter asked if we would like the leftovers sent to our room along with some mince pies. by the time signed the check and returned to our room, the box was there! | the clientele is very multi-cultural. the location is great for a peaceful walk through hyde park (across the street) as well as getting to heathrow quickly. i always get a kick out of the line up of luxury cars out front- g-wagons, bentleys, rolls royces, just an amazing site. | if you are interested in staying at a luxury hotel in london, do not hesitate to stay at the dorchester - or even just have s meal here- you will love it!! it is perfect, it will make you happy!!'''",2

The Savoy,"'''we booked two double rooms at the savoy so we could attend the dreamgirls show as a company treat. the theatre is literally a minute walk from the hotel which is ideal. dress up or dress down it does not matter! outside the savoy the art deco theme takes you back to the 1930's, porters in top hats and tails take luggage and accompanying people into the foyer on arrival. you book in at a one to one special reception area. | the drop off point outside has an art deco style fish glass fountain in the centre which leads onto the fabulous revolving doors and foyer lounge adorned with comfy sofas and fabulous pictures and sculptures. the dreamgirls show was fabulous. we paid a small fee to sit in a pre drinks room with nibbles and a complimentary drink, we were then escorted to and from our seats by an attendant . | the savoy has the most impeccably trained staff in professional etiquette, they really care about the customer . the food at the savoy grill was of a high standard, once again the staff catered to our every need . | our bedrooms were art deco and vintage victorian style, ample toiletries and immaculate bathroom . complimentary tea and coffee. warm cosy bathrobes and slippers . a comfy bed which was like sleeping on a cloud . what could not you love about this place. close to covent garden and in a great central position . this is a must visit place to anyone who likes comfort, cleanliness and customer care .'''",2

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we stayed here for a weekend break in london. this small luxury hotel is in a good location if you want to be in the city. it is about half-way between bank and moorgate. booked on a weekend deal, we paid a small premium to upgrade to a suite which was luxuriously appointed and very comfortable - very nice. we particularly liked the inclusion of a 'nespresso' machine. service was friendly and helpful. we had dinner in the hotel's 'off the wall' restaurant which was reasonably priced and, although not outstanding in terms of cuisine, was perfectly acceptable. the hotel's bar is a popular after-work drinking spot so expect to find it very busy and noisy on a friday night (as are all bars in the locality). all in all, a nice weekend break hotel and good value so we would happily return. | we had only one small complaint about the handling of our dinner reservation which drops our rating down from 5 to 4. receiving a reminder e-mail of our stay a few days before, we followed the email link therein to make a reservation. this got no reply. a follow-up phone call to the restaurant resulted in a promise to call back which never came. two more e-mails copied to both reception and restaurant went unanswered. on checking in we found no reservation made, but the reception desk was apologetic and happy to make the reservation for us. we arrive for dinner at 7:30pm to find no reservation. fortunately we also find the restaurant almost empty, so no problem. we do wonder what happened to all those emails though....'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''service was friendly and very helpful. | the room was small, but clean and in good condition. this room faced the courtyard, with no problem at all with traffic noise. | breakfast provided was excellent - a great start to the day, with friendly service. | just 2 mins walk from goodge street tube station, quite a bit further from russell square. euston/st pancras station about 20 mins level walk. | good bus service past the front door. | highly recommended.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''booked for sunday lunch at the dorchester grill room. have been before and all very nice as we expected. the only criticism is that the dessert menu was not very exciting - i always think that desserts should be very naughty - but these were a bit boring, nothing decadent or exciting. otherwise the service was perfect, with good food as it should be.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''at 5.00 pm you can have the very british tea time most excusive in london at the savoy, so my mother in law keeps tell me, but i rather have a refreshing drink at the beaufort bar the make the perfect gin tonic with a more than a little touch i would say one for the road ...... | sophisticated surroundings are'''",2

"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''this hotel is exceptional in every way. the doorman knows your name, check in is efficient and friendly and then you are whisked away to your room that has every detail covered. the floor to ceiling windows that open to a juliette balcony, but close to not let in a sound. the beds and linens that make it so hard to get up in the morning. full size bulgari bath products. this is the making of a home away from home. service is friendly and discreet. the location is one of the best in london. everything is close by and then you slip into the calmness and serenity of the hotel. | the award winning spa has a large indoor pool. the treatments are amazing. the lunch at the alain ducasse rivea was outstanding. small plate, all perfectly executed, with a lovely glass of wine. the service was so friendly and our host explained all the pates and helped us pick a perfect selection and amount. | discreet and gorgeous, i cannot wait to come back.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''deluxe room w river view is much better than on hotel web pics. gym is outstanding, though located in -2. restaurant is pricey but worth it, roof top opened till 1:30 am is top choice for a drink before sleep on arrival day. consierge &amp; reception team is young, dynamic and willing to help with best advice, you should not expect any tickets for wimbledon though:) best starting point for jogging by the river (6, 8, or 10k between westminster and tower bridge). spoil yourself with breakfast.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel is nothing short of exceptional. | in my opinion one of the best hotels in london. | from when you first enter you are welcomed by the doormen and shown to reception. check in is swift and even though we checked in early our room was ready for us. | the room is fantastically comfortable, with the not amazing bathroom. it is also really quiet, which for central london is a rarity. | location wise you cannot get better, right between the houses of parliament and just down from trafalagar square. get out and walk around from here. | breakfast was buffet style but with an a la crate option. the buffet however had everything that you need. | as the title suggest, i had a wonderful stay with my wife and will definitely be coming back when we are in london next.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed at the mondrian late nov 2017, for nearly a week, on business. the hotel was quite clean and modern. service from the staff was excellent. dcor in the lobby is a funky, not stuffy or old fashioned. i enjoyed long walks along the thames directly outside. | i was only able to enjoy the restaurant's breakfast buffet a few days, which was a downer (my fault). the bar/lounge was quite cool and comfy, during my down time in the evening. access to the london underground was convenient, as were available taxis. | no complaints here.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i stayed here in early august. it was a flawless experience. the room was quiet, clean, and incredibly comfortable. the location is fantastic- a very short walk to blackfriars tube and train station. you can walk over the bridge or through the train station if it is raining- using your oyster card to tap in and out to get through. there is a waitrose a few seconds away. the staff were lovely. even the music in the elevator was good. | i have been to london many times prior and it is always an unknown as to what the hotel will actually be like vs what it looks like online. but this was experience was truly represented. and it was a pleasure to be surrounded by tom dixon furnishings. | i did take the train into brighton for the day- it is only an hour and luckily the train leaves from blackfriars platform 1- which is the same platform you walk through to access the tube station (the one being the bridge over the thames) | i did not use any facilities here nor eat here either so cannot comment on anything related.'''",2
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''i chanced upon this hotel on one of my trips when trying to while away some time (or procrastinate) as i so commonly do these weekdays. unsatisfied with the lacklustre experience at the dorchester bar (which i cannot really fault apart from the feeling that i get of being a social pariah by dining alone), i decided i wanted to find another place to waste time and squander money whilst reading about the world and having lunch along with drinking copious amounts of green tea, why does this have to be so difficult! | thank god on that dreary late december 2012 afternoon i discovered 11 knightsbridge, also now known as the wellesley. only just officially opened that day, i was thus lucky enough to be able to have it all to myself (at least so i thought i would the following day). after having a browse and sneak peek by the amazing staff, i cancelled my 4 consecutive bookings at the dorchester and decided to give this hotel my full attention. | this dreamy hotel was first mentioned in 2010 as an aspirant to becoming london's first 6 star hotel. its history is quite interesting indeed. formerly a tube station serving and called ""hyde park corner station"", built in 1906 by iconic architect leslie green (who is handiwork is still evident with the lovely ox blood red tiles as seen on the facade's ground floor level), it was put out of service as a tube station in the 1930s, thereafter a townhouse was built atop. it is most famous residents (prior to it is stunning new tenants of course) was the pizza on the park, which yes was a posh version of pizza express, however the real action happened downstairs, which is where london's most iconic jazz and cabaret acts were conducted for nearly 30 years. sadly they closed with the hotel's development in june 2010, however the hotel has a nightly jazz performance inside the aptly named ""jazz room"", which seems a nice gesture to the loss of that venue. | with a reported 36 million spent on its redevelopment, the owners have not left a stone untouched in creating a sumptuous place of pure luxury. being two doors away from one of london's finest hotels, the lanesborough, this ""new kid"" in the extremely well heeled knightsbridge will have to work very hard to compete against this prestigious and graceful property. and work hard they did. | being a 36 room hotel mainly comprising of suites (29 to be precise), it does have a small number of ""normal"" rooms, however this hotel is more about being decadent (and happily so). its largest suite is located on the sixth floor (i cannot be sure if it is on the fifth and sixth to be precise) and is arguably london's largest (and one of the most expensive) at that. having looked online at the pictures and the in hotel brochure, i could only drool, as each room and suite was so beautifully appointed i wished i could stay here myself (sadly being a londoner does not afford me that option - unless my house is under renovation, rendering it uninhabitable can i then make that excuse ) | inside it is super luxe, not usual on the london scene. housing a stunning art deco corridor, marble galore as to be expected, it has one cosy restaurant called oval which is absolutely gorgeous (with its approximately 28 covers). it also has london's largest bespoke humidor, with cigar prices starting from a nice 20 to an eye watering 2,000, and a crystal bar, very beautiful indeed. for me, its piece de resistance is an outside heated ""cigar"" lounge. i prefer to call it a lounge as i do not smoke but it did not bother me if smokers did. there are two of these on either side of the entrance and again this is definitely a super luxurious experience, with lovely roaring fire, 4 teak chairs to a table (no booking ever required, how lovely). i came here and ate lunch and had green tea on many an afternoon, and it was so perfect. | you will notice the leather used on the chairs in the lounge, and to fashion the wall, is crocodile and ostrich skin respectively. thankfully these are faux, and quite rightly so, i would hazard to think what it would cost to replace a damaged chair if it was not. | i was really hoping that i would refrain from writing a review about the wellesley on trip advisor , but in the end i felt it would be a real disservice to londoners if i did not. it is one of london's true gems of a hotel, not many places have outdoor spaces that are private but still retain the hustle and bustle of london life (the roar of supercars and london's endless buses can be heard while you luxuriate in splendour). | one small problem i kindly request the management to address is the strong whiff of cigar/ cigarette odour and stale air in the lobby and adjoining interior areas caused by the two cigar lounges. i did not notice this when i went again in mid jan 2013, so it may have been fixed, but this needs to be put in order immediately, as having to passively smoke is not a luxurious experience at all, and not one that goes with the entire hotel ethos. | however, this is a brand new hotel, only been open for nearly a month, and i have full faith this will be addressed swiftly. i hope then that it does achieve its aim of becoming london's first (and maybe only) 6 star hotel.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we had lunch there and the food was excellent. the beef was tender and medium rare, the veg was cooked to perfection and the service was attentive. the toilets were sparkling. the hotel itself looked very inviting and i look forward to booking a room next time i stay in london'''",2

"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''we spent two weeks at the new bulgari hotel in london, and i have to say it has been a pleasure. we were only supposed to be there for 5 nights but extended the stay due to illness. with the olympics starting, the hotel had to find room for us when they are practically full. the staff are amazing, service immaculate, room service food truly fabulous and beds wonderfully comfy. the pool is by far the nicest i have had the pleasure to swim in considering its underground. the spa staff are marvelous. decor super relaxing. | the bar is ber chic and am sure will be more packed once people find out about it. ignore the food critic review in the times newspaper. he should move over and let someone younger do his job. he is obviously too bored with the slog of eating so much expensive food all the time! poor love. am pretty sure all the critics are calling it vulgari because they cannot think of anything else that rhymes! are not they clever!!! | so, my review of the restaurant is this. if you like top notch grub and you do not mind paying for it, cool. my favorite was the john dory. delicious! | by the way, the cheese board is a little like scones, jam and cream, savory style. try it, you will see what i mean!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''where to start - we checked in to the corinthia yesterday as a special treat to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. what a treat! the corinthia is out of this world. for a start, the service is incredible. from the moment we checked in we received first-class treatment (thank you daniel at reception!) we were given a complementary upgrade and asked whether we would like a late check out. when we got to our room, we were greeted with a bottle of champagne and chocolate cake. the room itself was stunning and included everything we could possibly need from a walk-in wardrobe to bath tub, nighttime lavender sachets and sheets so divinely soft i actually wanted to take them home with me!! we spent most of the daytime enjoying the spa which a treat not to be missed (recently featured in tatler spa supplement as the number one london spa). the spa, which spans 4 floors, includes a well equipped gym, sleeping pods, jet pool, saunas and steam rooms and fabulous treatments. every little detail has been thought through and the result is magnificent. my only complaint about our stay here is that it was not long enough! i cannot wait for another special occasion to come back again.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''for my 30th i was treated to a weekend at the corinthia, wow! what an experience it is, the best hotel i have ever stayed in by far. quality everything; welcome, service, room, food, drinks &amp; magnificent health spa (especially the steam room). a weekend of bests. best hotel experience, best black pudding at breakfast, best seabass for dinner, best gnt from the bar. not even sharing the hotel with the man utd squad could put a dampener on things. the corinthia is a must.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''i found this to be an excellent small hotel in a great location. the lounge is very inviting, the rooms were just what a weary tourist needs &amp; it is located close to a great restaurant &amp; other facilities. the staff is excellent. a suburb bargain &amp; will probably always make it my london headquarters.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we returned again to the corinthia (this is where we stayed when we got married at the royal festival hall) so the hotel has very special memories for us both. we have stayed here since but on this occasion specifically asked if we could have the same room, facing the thames under the o in corinthia was the clue i gave them. they did the rest of the work and found the room we had on that special day. the bathroom is stunning with bath in the centre of the room and a tv and sound system to totally relax with. we had a wonderfully fruity bottle of wine (very reasonably priced at 27.00) and enjoyed the complimentary nibbles in massimo between 1800 and 1930. a quick walk to settle the food and then back to bassoon to work our way through the cocktail menu. although the bar was very busy (function in the ballroom) we were found a table quickly and had our first cocktails whilst quaffing, chatting and people watching whilst the band played on...after numerous wonderfully mixed and varied cocktails we left just after midnight. we rose early on the sunday and made our way down to the thermal floor for some swimming and other treatments to relax ourselves before breakfast in northall. the room itself is light airy and was busy but not too much so. we opted for the self serve breakfast which gives the chance to sample many other items we would normally, even the dim sum which i am advised by someone who prides himself on food from that region, was some of the best he has tasted. full and contented we returned to our room for a final bath and late checkout which gave us the opportunity to make the most of this special stay. many thanks to all at the corinthia for making this return visit so special. we will return again later this year to what has to be one of the best london hotels and certainly the best spa and thermal floor areas.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i stayed at the corinthia for valentine weekend in february. it is a true 5 stars hotel with minor things that could be changed for a perfect experience. the inside is marvelous, high ceiling, spotless tea area, excellent staff. one of the best hotel breakfast i ever had, in 2 beautiful massive rooms and with some original asian suggestions for the more adventurous! although the hotel is big, it always fell intimate. our room was great with a warm atmosphere you did not expect. i adored the heated bathroom floor. the bathroom curtain and blinds were broken though, and needed serious repair which fell strange for this level of hotel. corinthia is very well located. outside are your typical grand and classic london buildings, close to the river. but of course we went for the famous spa. it does get busy so be careful with the moment you pick to go (cannot imagine what it is like on a saturday). in an outstanding dark setting, incredible sauna, massive jacuzzi pool, perfect hammam, lovely sleeping pods. but its low point is its visible popularity. some parts could get an update, a couple of broken elements, lots of towels everywhere. could do with more staff inside to tell people to keep quiet also! but it is very impressive. we also tried the room service which was pricey and a bit slow but good. so i would definitely recommend the corinthia for a romantic getaway. they could do with a little refurbishment but it definitely is a 5 star hotel!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''of course this is one of the most famous hotels in the world, and we were blessed to spend two nights as part of a tour. loved the combination of art deco and elegant traditional decor. what stands out at the savoy is the exceptional service and attention. the staff always acknowledged our presence from the moment our taxi door was opened to the final farewell. never did we enter a public area or room where we were not spoken to or smiled at by one of the savoy personnel. we were just ordinary americans, but we were treated like royalty! it is an experience we will never forget.'''",2
The Rembrandt,'''have stayed here before and as always everything was of an excellent standard. the room was spacious for two and the additional table and chairs welcome. internet access is now free and reception much improved since my previous visit. now available in the rooms and not just the public areas. breakfast was very good. the pool and spa were most welcoming. all staff were exceptional.''',2

London Guest House,"'''the staff are all very friendly ... me &amp; mum enjoyed our stay and will surely visit the london guest house again. bus stops are exactly in front of the guesthouse...the underground is just a few bus stops away and you will arrive in central london in just 15 minutes! acton has a number of pubs and restaurants aswell and newsagents and supermarkets surround the guesthouse. our double bedroom was a bit small but considering you only sleep in it, it was comfy. the room is cleaned everyday - spick and span!! breakfast was great, you can eat as much as you like and it is very filling - nothing fried - toast, cereal, muffins, coffee , juices, boiled eggs etc .... prices are very cheap compared with central london hotels. worthit!!!'''",2
The Lanesborough,"'''a wonderful one night stay and this super 5 star london hotel. we had stayed here before their refurbishment and this time it was just a nice, just a good and no disappointments at all. love the public areas, the lobby, the bar etc. our room was not overly large but cosy, had a great view over the park and was decorated beautifully. butler was helpful and friendly. we were at a function in the evening and the food was lovely. breakfast was delicious in celeste, could not fault anything, cannot wait to stay again.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we stayed here last year, you can see the review on here. we were lucky enough to have another weekend there last month. just as fabulous, just as unique. the whole hotel is still faultless, no signs of wear and tear and the staff are impeccable. human, fantastically helpful but normal, not overly subservient. | a real highlight was the service in kaspars, the food and service was beyond question. | it is pricey,....but even at their prices genuinely provides value for money. well, well worth it. if you can...you should. we know of no hotel in the world that comes close.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i was intrigued by the ""minimalist"" and confident ads in vanity fair so we decided to stay there on our recent board visit. we took 7 rooms in the hotel so this review takes into account my partners views as well. the hotel is outstanding from every aspect. great position just off trafalgar square. exceptional decor and finishes. wonderful service (could smile a bit more - quite stiff). superb bar with amazing advice, cocktails etc. breakfast a bit pricey. excellent coffee and a good afternoon tea offering. rooms are superb - bed very comfy. bathrooms are outstanding. all in all, a great stay !!'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my partner and i recently spent 5 nights here in a deluxe city view room. the experience that we had was truly amazing. | after a slight blip upon arrival, we got situated into our room at 10 am as was promised with the early check-in feature. | the room itself was nice, if a bit oddly laid out. there was a sitting chair in the bedroom, but it was in such a place that made it difficult to access the bar area. this was the only con, however, in a sea of pros. | the first night we got back from being out in the evening at the theatre, they had decorated the bed with pink roses and also left a white rose bouquet on the table. it was such a classy touch! | we ate in both restaurants and also went to the bassoon bar twice. never have i actually done that at a hotel, but both restaurants were excellent in both the food and service. the bassoon bar, in short, is one of the most amazing classic bars i have ever been patronized. pricey but so worth the experience. even the one night we ordered rooms service was classy and so elegantly presented. | the one thing that echoed throughout our stay was the amazing service everywhere. | we look forward to out next stay at this hotel.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''my wife and i stayed two nights end of may 2012. check in very cordial, without asking were upgraded to a huge room with hallway, door to bedroom. lots of space for clothes, comfortable bed, nice shower and bath in large bathroom. in park lane about 5 minutes brisk walk from marble arch in the heart of oxford street. on the way we passed luxury car dealerships. the hotel offers transport in a beautiful rolls royce, price do not ask. the value was great, satisfactory breakfast included but not a buffet. it was low season so rates were discounted by half, about 400 pds per night. the service is just exceptional, the fixtures outstanding. on the downside the bags took about an hour to reach the room, and the concierge was not representative of the standard of service elsewhere. you may not get the advertised view.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''overall we had a positive experience of the hotel and its staff. i especially liked the decor and the furniture. it is a quiet and nice environment to rest in. the staff are helpful and service oriented. we had the breakfast at caspers and we needed to make orders from the menu because there was no buffet. it was a bit sad because i like to see what is up and choose what i like. one evening it was live music at the wing, which is ok if you are not sitting next to the performance having dinner. we could not converse at the table at all throughout the meal. it would have been nice to get the information about the performance, then we could have chosen a different table than the one we were directed to. the dinner was dry since i got chicken and potatoes with nothing else. | we also ate at savoy grill on two occasions and the food was very good. we were recommended wine both times suitable for the food which was very successful. we spent a lot of time in both bars because we waited for the new year. the service was perfect. | my rating will be a weak 4 due to the shortcomings in the room and some tasks that were not performed by the staff. the room was small and the airconditioner very noisy. the bathroom was large with both a bath and a shower. unfortunately it was difficult to get hot water to the bath which was a bit of a disappointment. then the makeup mirror was just next to the toilet so you had to stand very close to the toilet when you put on makeup. the staff missed out some smaller things that should not be a big deal, if its not a 5 star hotel service we are talking about. i have stayed at the serena hotel in africa quit a few times and in comparision with serena this hotel is a weak 4. but, however no hotel in europe can actually compete with serena hotel. so with that being said the savoy is a good place to be and worth a stay when you are visiting london.'''",2
The Lanesborough,"'''the lanesborough offers a very posh high tea well worth your time and money. this is a rare opportunity to take part in a long standing british tradition, but be prepared to pay for the experience. diners should dress for the event and come with an appetite. tea begins with a selection of brews from around the world with the option - mandatory in the holiday season - of a champagne high tea. tea is served with a variety of finger sandwiches followed by an assortment of artistic and delicious pastries. the bill will not be for the faint of heart - about $100 for an adult and $30 for the kids.'''",2
The Lanesborough,'''my boyfriend and i went to dine at cleste for dinner and had a couple cocktails before in the library bar. | i have to say i was so impressed. everything was immaculate ! every member of the team look incredibly smart and ever so polite. lily at reception along with ruth were so welcoming and were more than happy to take time to speak to us and take our picture and show us to the bar and where we would be dining later. | the beautiful andrea looked after us in the bar. so polite and making sure we were happy and ordered the right drinks for us. she was really helpful and very graceful in her art. | we then dined at cleste and i do not think there is enough space on here to right everything i would like to but in short... | the food was unforgettable. we wiped our plate clean every time! we were taken care of by marco who was so professional and explained everything so well. thank you so much for your patience.. we just could not decide so we had a bit of everything! | there were two other girls i really loved.. the sommelier was so lovely and she helped us match our wine with the food and was so polite when we did not go for the recommendation each time. | to finish ... the girl from bretagne! i think her name was chloe. she was my highlight of the night ! so friendly but not too much. making us feel so comfortable the whole way through. it felt like she was so happy to be there and serve us. i will remember her for sure. | thank you very much for making my experience so special and unique.''',2

The Savoy,"'''i will try to get some photos uploaded, as soon as i find my sd card! the savoy is gorgeous and the service is impeccable. upon arriving you are greeted warmly and escorted into a private reservation area to a desk, not a reception ""bar"", which is nice. all of the attention is on you and your reservation. that person then walks you to your room, we were upgraded to a junior suite by our group, and had a gorgeous room with a separate sitting area. no view, but that is okay, we spent our time outside visiting places we missed on our previous trip to london. | there was a bowl of fresh fruit and bottled water in our room, which was very nice. the bathrooms are huge and have every amenity. the rose scented lotions, bath salts and lotions were glorious!! they also provide loofahs for you for the shower and the bath! there are huge soft robes and a fabulous towel warmer in the bathroom. i never wanted to leave that room. bathrooms are my weakness!! | the hotel is located in the heart of everything; shopping, theatre, restaurants, the thames behind the hotel and a gorgeous city park. it is a short walk to everything: trafalgar square, buckingham palace, museums, all of it. we never bothered with the buses or taxi, preferring to walk and photograph everything! | tipping is not expected, but being from the usa i feel guilty if i do not tip and it is very appreciated. | note: the savoy advised us not to tip the cab driver from the hotel to anywhere. because they are picking up at the most luxurious hotel in london, they already raise their fee. they may get a bit mad, but so what, its not like you will see them again! we found this to be true. when we took a cab from the hotel versus across the street at just the corner, there was a $12.00 usd difference!! listen to the savoy. | have tea in the main dining room. get there early if you want the gazebo, it goes fast! (we never did catch it at the right time.) | check the weather, it can get very cold and very windy in the winter months. | bring really good walking shoes (but please not touristy with old sneakers). use the tube to get back and forth from downtown as it is so much more fun than a taxi. people watching is fabulous and everyone is so helpful! plus you save about $75.00. | have a lovely time!!'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''fantastic location, slap bang in the middle of london. bit of a small room, but maybe my budget was too small. only had breakfast there, which, was well, breakfast - nothing too flash. service good, gym next door was well-priced and adequately stocked. no technical problems with tv etc, great little italian cafe as you turn right outside the entrance - worth a visit. i asked if i could store some scallops in the chef's fridge which caused a bit of a scene - but we got there in the end after a few levels of management were involved. not quite sure why general staff are scared to make their own decisions. anyway - good time!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''our two night stay was part of a very special package booked specifically for the world cup rugby. we knew we had booked one of the top hotels in london so were aware as with most hotels prices for anything in the hotel would reflect this. we arrived at midday, were greeted warmly and as we expected were advised the room was not ready, however they stored our luggage for us. my first impression of the lobby and the public areas were lots of mirrors. we met our friends who were also staying in the bar and had a drink, 2 small bottled beers and 2 coca colas = 26! | we went out for lunch, it is in a very nice location and about 8-10 minutes walk either way to green park or marble arch stations. on our return our rooms were ready and on reaching them, the luggage was there. ours was a standard room on the 5th floor, no real view out of the window but a bonus was the windows actually open, there is air-con as well. the room itself was very comfortable, traditional decor, nice bathroom, ours had a seperate shower and bath with twin sinks, our friends said their room had a bath only with shower over it. there are nice toiletries and the towels are lovely, soft and large. the mini bar is best avoided unless you are desperate and really do not mind paying extortionate money for items ie 3.50 for a small bag of tyrells crisps, 6.00 for 500ml bottle of water! furthermore there are no coffee or tea making facilities in the room which, whilst we respect that maybe most people who stay at the hotel would be happy to use room service, we felt this was a bit poor. not everyone wishes to wait for a cup of tea to be brought to the room. we have certainly stayed in 5 star hotels in many parts of the world where this was available. the beds are turned down in the evening and we had a small bottle of water left by our beds on the second night but not on the first, little bit inconsistent for a hotel of this standard. another thing was the wi-fi, there is one day complimentary standard wifi but not superfast, this has to be paid for, this is really archaic considering most hotels offer it free. included in our rate was breakfast which we had in the grill. the staff were very friendly, helpful and we found efficient. breakfast has a great choice and certainly plenty of it. we all chose the traditional english breakfast which we all had in a variety of combinations. the one thing we all commented on was how well the poached eggs were cooked and the yolks were some of the yellowest i have ever seen. all very nicely presented with excellent service and certainly very yummy. this was consistent on both mornings. again when checking out the staff were very friendly and efficient and we were able to leave our bags in storage. whilst we had a very comfortable stay, i suppose the only thing about the hotel which stood out for us are the staff, certainly very pleasant attentive and friendly. the hotel itself was nice but we were certainly not overwhelmed by it. it was a nice experience but not sure i would stay again.'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''it is rare to visit a hotel, particularly for me in my job where i stay in a lot of hotels, and end up feeling like it was perfect. there is always something that can be a little better, the bed, the shower, one staff member who was a little off, or some food that was below par. possibly for the first time, i enjoyed a hotel stay which could not have been better. it was perfect. the room, the spa, the general decor and comfort, the food and drink, and probably most of all an exceptional group of staff who were never short of delightful, without ever being overbearing. you do of course pay for all of this, but as a treat it was so very worth it. this is an exceptional hotel in an ideal spot, highest marks and praise indeed for a truly outstanding experience. we will be back!'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''just returned from a 6 night stay with family at the rembrandt on our first visit to london from usa. this hotel checked all of our boxes - great location (less than 5 min walk to tube station that had 3 lines running from it), short walk to harrods and other shopping, reasonably priced restaurants in close proximity, 3 museums within very short walk, breakfast and wifi included, reasonably priced rooms. we stayed in room 350 and although there was no view to speak of it was very quiet so no problem sleeping. the room was just large enough for 3 people with a king size bed and small couch that pulled out to a single bed. bathroom included a whirlpool jetted tub. the room itself was nothing spectacular but it more than served it is purpose. the bar area was nice with decent food and the lounge was large but cozy. breakfast was adequate - scrambled/poached eggs everyday with toast along with fruit and other typical european breakfast fare. for a family vacation centered around seeing the sites of london we felt this was an excellent location and had no problem hopping the tube to see everything we wanted to. we would definitely book another stay at this hotel if the occasion arises!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my fiancee and i stayed in the corinthia for 2 nights in december 2014 shortly after we got engaged. we have both stayed at luxury hotels across the us (four seasons, ritz carlton, etc.), but neither one of us had stayed at a place like this...simply the nicest hotel we have ever been to. fortunately, i was able to book the room through my former employer, who maintained a corporate rate at the hotel for clients/employees staying in london. without this reduced rate, we likely would have never booked at the corinthia, but having stayed there now, i would certainly pay the full rate next time i am in london. | the common area decor (lobby, restaurant, bar, etc.) is stunning. the front-desk staff and concierge were amazing. immediately upon arrival they offered to upgrade us to a nicer room, and the concierge gave us handwritten directions to navigate the underground across town both days we stayed there. | the room was incredible, with a very comfortable king sized bed (never seen one in europe), high ceilings, wood floors, heated bathroom floor, huge tub with a flat screen tv at one end, and a waterfall shower...it even had a few north american outlets for those w/o a converter. we also used the gym on one of the days which was pretty big for a hotel. | overall, just an incredible hotel. definitely will be back.'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here for two nights at the beginning of november in a grand room. very nice room with a lovely seating area and a spa bath and a few other extras. room was clean and well equipped, but would have been nice if complimentary fruit had been supplied without us having to ask for it. cleaning a little lacking as dirty plates supplied with fruit and peel not removed. breakfast was good, with lots of choice of both cooked and cold food. excellent selection of pastries but was a little surprised the fruit on offer was mostly tinned. excellent location for both tube and buses.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed here on a secrets escapes deal and we just could not fault it. we stayed in room 333 a gorgeous room with a giant sized bed and a jacuzzi . the view was of the v and a museum. it was a special anniversary weekend and the upgrade ,bottle of wine and lovely card from the manager was very much appreciated. the staff were all lovely and the service was second to none. we are not frequent visitors to london our last trip was over three years ago but we definitely be making the rembrantdt our first choice on future visits.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''the building has been wonderfully restored with good attention to the finishing detail. however, i am not sure if the management company has a pedigree in running properties to five star standards of service. luggage delivery on arrival took too long (over 30 minutes from the time we got to the room) but a card was pushed under the room door during the day advertising a shoe shine service (!). there is a large tropical shower head in the shower cubicle but there are no reading lights beside / on the bed (bedside table lamps do not allow for comfortable reading in bed). there are pleasant touches (for the winter months) such as underfloor heating in the bathroom but there was no full-length mirror and there was no telephone in the bathroom. one or two other reviews allude to pomposity. the staff need to relax rather than follow parrot-fashion the hotel chain's manuals. when was the last time you were asked if you would enjoyed ""your residence"" when checking out of a hotel?'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this hotel has the wow factor in bags. it has amazing views over the river with the interiors designed by tom dixon. | rooms - the basic rooms are anything but and you really do not need to book anything more than that. the bathrooms are stunning - white marble, amazing lighting, huge rainfall shower and malin + goetz products. the rooms are sexy - there is no other way to describe them. they have all the usual tech with a wonderful mini bar (packed with high end drinks and snacks). bed is super comfortable and there is a blackout curtain. | spa - this hotel has a stunning spa. i did not use it, but if it is anything like the rest of the hotel it will be fabulous. | bars - this hotel has two bars. dandelyan and the rumpus rooms. the former is on the ground floor and offers a huge range of cocktails that change every few months. the atmosphere is great - always very busy so you will need to book. the burgers are also delicious. the rumpus rooms is my favourite cocktail bar in london. the sumptuous decor with spectacular views over the river together with amazing cocktails make it a winner. again, make sure you book. | price - this place is expensive. it is not ritz / dorchester expensive but the rooms are around 300 per night. the drinks are between 13-21 each so be prepared for a hefty bill.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''upon arriving at the savoy we were greeted and checked in. we had booked a deluxe king with either a courtyard view or city view. the room was on the 2nd floor with a small window facing a large black duct (see photo). we were informed that there was no other rooms available as i was disappointed that our room had been downgraded from the description we had reserved. upon going on line i saw that there were rooms available to be booked for that night so i am not sure why they could not move us to a more suitable room. we had informed them that we were celebrating our 20th anniversary and we are presidents club members who have had fabulous experiences with the fairmont chain. the room was ok but the bathtub/shower drain was broken. i went down again to see if there was any alternative and was told that they would move us the next day which was preferable but meant that we could not unpack and had to make sure everything remained packed since we were leaving the hotel early for a full day tour of the countryside. on a much more positive note, they sent a lovely cake to acknowledge our anniversary. we had tea in the thames foyer which far exceeded our expectations and was just fabulous. the concierge had our theater tickets ready and was very helpful but unfortunately she could not find the information regarding our tour (i had called ahead to arrange for morning pickup). after spending the day in the country and having a fabulous indian dinner at punjab, we returned to the savoy and found we had been moved to the 6th floor with a terrific city/river view. i was still a little bothered by the conversation with the front desk staff who did not have a record of my request for a room on a high floor and insisted that the view of the duct was not a downgrade from the category i had booked. in my past experiences with fairmont i have been upgraded and also remained in my chosen category but i had never anticipated the downgrade. the new room has a terrific view. i would suggest adding a few more electrical outlets since people have cameras/phones to charge and the adapters do not seem to work. also the hairdryer they provide does not work in the bathroom so you must dry your hair in the small bedroom which can disturb your traveling companion if they are sleeping or watching tv. anyway we have 3 more days at the savoy and we are really looking forward to enjoying them.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''internet service in rooms and throughout the hotel is very, very bad. only a few times each day was there enough bandwidth to even use it. the connection is fine, but it does not support the traffic. honestly, when riding the london underground i could connect to virgin mobile when the train stopped and pull down a page faster than at the corinthia. i complained, and the manager seemed to care, although he mostly implied it was working fine for everyone else?? forget about skype or facetime calls to friends back home and you could never upload a photo in a e-mail, difficult just sending an e-mail. all the other fantastic reviews people have offered are true and that needs no more comment on my part. but since many people that use tripadvisor to find this hotel initially will continue to use tripadvisor for restaurants or activities it may be worth mentioning you will be sitting in the starbucks near the hotel to surf the internet. i think for $600 per night the internet service should be better. be careful with the excuse the manager will offer in response to my comments - we tried pc, ipad, iphones... nothing worked well at the corinthia but everything worked fine at starbucks, you can do the math.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i had a great time at the rhodes hotel. i especially loved the bathroom with the light up bathtub. i liked that the hotel was close to paddington station because we used the tube a lot. the service was very good and the owner of the hotel would sit next to us when we were having breakfast so he could talk to us. my only complaint would be the staircases. they were tight, narrow and it would be hard to carry your luggage up the stairs. but it was an old row house that was converted into a hotel so what can i say. the breakfast was nice and simple. i had to get used to the time change so it was nice that i would not have to order a big meal and only eat half of it. you really only need a simple hotel in london because its not like your going to stay at your hotel the whole day. your in london! overall it was a great hotel to stay at.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i took my family of eleven, ages 20-78 may 18-22, 2014. we had five gorgeous rooms--all very large along with a jr. suite. our rooms were on the 5th floor with #543/546 (balcony) being the largest with a hall, walk in closet, huge double sink bathroom w/separate toilet &amp; bidet, separate shower and tub. the bedroom was very large with a nespresso maker (we just bought one because of that experience.). the building was a prior defense building converted into this luxurious hotel three years ago. it is lined with copper making it the most quiet room we have ever been in. the bed linens were like climbing into a silken womb. even more extraordinary than the hotel's amenities and size was the staff!! whenever we entered the lobby or the restaurant, we were hovered over by this amazing group of people. our slightest wish was immediately acted upon. above all, the concierge were exceptional. max endacott, concierge, helped me plan our trip in london since last december. we must have exchanged at least 200 emails. max never failed to get back to me. if max had the day off, others immediately emailed me to answer my questions. sahil, the first concierge i was in contact with in december actually called me to help me create an itinerary for me to present to my family as their christmas present. i have never encountered such a caring staff in any hotel i/we have stayed in; and, we always stay in 5 star hotels. the location is perfect. the buffet breakfast is outstanding. we would meet for breakfast and have lots of fun discussing the day's itinerary and really enjoyed the wide variety of food along with the very responsive wait staff. all of my children and grandchildren ""loved"" the spa!!! i can never say enough about this glorious hotel. we all want to ""live"" there. i continue to dream about our experience and cannot wait to go back. donna/aspen'''",2

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the hotel was under a renovation during my stay in london, so at first i have not noticed the luxury or the impressive front of the hotel since it was covered by a huge sign, but once you get inside the thing changes radically. walls, floors and carpets are of refined taste. there is no noise inside it is a very quite place. service is great, they are really committed to make you fell special. you may really enjoy staying here, besides is very well located, near harrods department store and some others luxury stores.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i stayed here courtesy of a priceline bid, so it was a great value. my first reaction at seeing the location was to groan, since it is across the river from the nearest tube station (blackfriars). but, in reality, it is just three blocks or so in terms of distance, and about the same from southwark station. it looks like most rooms do not have a river view--mine did not--but at least you can enjoy the sites in the bars and restaurants. the decor is a bit too glitzy for my taste--a desk chair too hip to have a full seat or arm rests, a great abstract blob of paints on the wall instead of a painting, but the bed was comfortable and the elephant-head shower a pleasure. if i was paying full price, i would have gone elsewhere, but it was fine for a couple of days. beware of the breakfast, though. in most hotels, when the hostess asks for your room number, you expect the meal to be included with the room rate. here, though, you will be presented with a bill for more than 20 pounds for a good but not great buffet.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed for 7 nights at the ""oh so convenient"" rembrandt hotel in south kensington. the staff was fantastic (especially the concierge pablo, who helped us with theatre tickets, taxis and our flight reservations). our room was a twin with plenty of space to stretch out, a seating area, a large bathroom, with all being very clean and recently updated. the area has lots of shopping, museums and restaurants galore. there are 2 tube stations within walking distance and the bus dropped us a half block away from the doorstep. i have been to london a few times and have finally found a hotel to return to time and time again.'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''i booked a trip to london in january with ba - which included one night free in a london hotel. i chose the rembrandt - and a very good choice at that. my room was not ready when i arrived so they let me use the facilities at the adjoining fitness center, where i was able to shower and change. my room was clean -- 2 twin beds -- and not too small. easy access to the the south ken underground - and across the street from the v&amp;a. a good choice for the free breakfast as well. the room was clean with amenties ... a working, strong shower, for example. i stayed only one night as i moved to my usual hotel. however, i would consider this a good choice as a backup hotel. it was a good and pleasant surprise for an overnight stay.'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''this was my second stay at the rembrandt after a 12 year lapse. outstanding location to so many great activities, neighborhoods, harrods, museums and 3 tube lines. the staff is very diligent and works hard to make your stay enjoyable and to address your inquiries. the continental breakfast is first class with a wide assortment of cold items that are healthy, too. | i have a couple of observations that i need to share. the room that i was in when the lights were off at night had a blue light glowing that was disruptive to a sleeping pattern. i had to wear night shades that i would wear on an airline night flight. | the second observation for my specific room is depending on the time of the day, when i walked in there was a mildew smell from the carpet. i was fortunate where i was in london for a week with no rain (impossible), but i would think carpet would not be the best floor covering in a wet climate.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''came to the mondrian to celebrate our wedding anniversary and were certainly not disappointed. handy location, cutting edge design throughout the hotel. all of the staff were extremely friendly, efficient and helpful. our superior room on 14th floor was furnished in a very modern yet very comfortable manner. the views down the river were great. cocktails and snacks in dandelyan by the river excellent, maybe slightly less good in the rumpus room at night but this was still very cool and comfortable. | overall a fabulous experience which we hope to repeat again soon!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''what a wonderful hotel - pleasure to the full. the superior room was really nice and the breakfast so delicious. the staff at breakfast time was so attentive and polite. the gentleman with french accent was first class, delivering very personal yet professional service. we will be back.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''hard to review this one. the location is somewhat odd. you are very close to trafalgar square (less than 5-mins walk) but it feels miles away, almost like you are not actually in london. one of the quietest hotel rooms i have ever stayed in (room 210) and a great bed to boot. nice and clean and (for any americans reading) a shower (in britain) that actually works properly. only bad thing about the room was the movie selection - rather weak and somewhat expensive. | hotel itself is great. lovely breakfast area (truly great coffee and scrambled eggs and smoked salmon on toasted brioche was awesome!). there also the restaurant and an 'outside in' lounge (it is outside but feels like it is inside) where you can smoke in all weathers. also has a good selection of cigars. | the spa...probably the best in london. it looks a bit like dr evil's liar - all black marble - but it truly has to be seen. stainless steel swimming pool and huge sauna, steam room and every treatment you can imagine. could easily spend a day down there. by the way, kids under 16 are allowed in the spa/pool 10-11.30 and 3-4.30, which is a nice touch. one thing i would change: please no ibiza style chill music in the sauna! | staff are excellent too.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my wife and i spent four nights at the mondrian from friday - tuesday. we were greeted like family at the front desk by a wonderful woman named hadassa. she checked us in quickly and then spend time answering all of our questions, and we had a lot. hadassa was incredibly knowledgable and helpful! | the room was amazing. even though it was on the city side of the hotel, we still could view the thames since we were on the 11th floor. | the room, entrance, and restaurant were all vibrant and clean. our bathroom was spacious! the bed was so wonderful. my wife likes a soft mattress and i prefer a mattress that is more firm. however somehow this bed was the perfect combination. | walking out of the hotel and being right beside the thames, a few minutes to the nearest metro, multiple quality restaurants, amazing staff (thanks hadassa!), and a spa. i do not know what else i could have asked for!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my experience with corinthia hotel londo was very pleasent. the hotel has outstanding services and localization, near trafalgar square but in a very quiet place. the concierge and front desk people were very kind and helpful. my room was very nice and well decorated. i really enjoyed my stay.'''",2
London Guest House,"'''i stayed at the london guest house while visiting a friend and doing some sightseeing in london. i booked a single room, so it was a bit small by american standards; but, by european standards and for the price, the room was more than adequate. the room was clean, including the bed and ensuite bathroom. i paid 50 gbp per night for a single room, and breakfast was included. the staff was very helpful and friendly, and the front desk is staffed 24/7. bus/tube access from the hotel is quite easy; i relied heavily on the buses and tube in order to travel to central london. overall, a very good, clean, and well worth your money.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''perfect location close to most the touristic sights. | very modern and design inspired atmosphere. | front office desk, porters and some restaurant staff was very engaged and serious, clearly focusing on offering a great experience. i am not convinced about the overall performance of the breakfast staff however, the focus seemed to be more on operative issues rather on having a split vision ableing a solid and rapid customer awareness. | in general though i do not have a problem coming back here, it would be a pleasure.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this was the first stay (but not our last) for me and my wife at the corinthia and we were not disappointed. everything about this hotel exudes luxury, from the first time you walk into the grand foyer to the exquisitely appointed rooms and the superb restaurants. | on arriving we were met by the very welcoming and attentive door staff that collected our bags from the car and showed us to reception. check in was easy and painless and within minutes we were shown to our room and given a rundown of the facilities. | we stayed for three nights in an executive king room. the room was spacious with a large walk in wardrobe and an equally spacious bathroom. the bed was comfortable and the room very quiet. the housekeeping team and turn down team deserve and mention as were very thorough and never missed a trick. | the first night we ate at massimos which serves italian cuisine. the food was amazing and the staff even more so, they were all very personable and took the time to explain the menu and give you some guidance as to what to try, if needed. the second night we used room service and were impressed by the ease of ordering and the speed of the food arriving. when the food arrived the staff member was so attentive and rearranged the seating for us so we could dine in comfort. i know this is what you would expect from a five star establishment but this is not always the case. | they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day and the corinthia obviously agrees. this is by far the best breakfast experience we have ever had at a five star hotel. if like my wife you enjoy the buffet style breakfast then you will be in your element. the variety of fruits, pastries, fresh breads, meats and cereals is exceptional and are always replenished. if like me on the other hand you enjoy something off of the menu then do not fear you have a wide range of choice to, but i would strongly recommend the eggs benedict, best i have ever had!! the breakfast was amazing but yet again this was outdone by the staff and in particular one member of staff (sorry i did not manage to get his name) he treated us every morning like we had dined for breakfast for months. always remembering our names, always very attentive, always remembering our preferences, my coffee cup or glass was never empty. he was very friendly and a credit to the corinthia. | i cannot leave a review without mentioning the spa. i have to say i myself am not a regular spa visitor but my wife is, and she was extremely impressed by the very modern and luxurious facilities, as was i! it has all the facilities you would expect, swimming pool, vitality pool, steam room &amp; sauna. as this is free for all guests i would strongly recommend you make time to visit, you will not be disappointed. my wife also had a massage and requested a deep tissue full body massage and was not disappointed by her therapist who used the perfect pressure. the treatment room was quiet and relaxing. i did not have chance to use the gym facilities but will on my return. | unfortunately we did not get round to having afternoon tea, which was a shame as i have heard great things about the experience. | i have never stayed in a five star hotel and had the perfect stay, which i guess you expect, and as such have never written a review but the corinthia and all its staff deserves all the praise and recognition it gets. this is truly a five star hotel from top to bottom, if you are after luxurious surroundings, very professional and attentive staff, then look no further, the corinthia is for you. the corinthia is now our london hotel of choice and as such have booked our return in august to celebrate our anniversary. | thank you corinthia for making our stay perfect and see you soon!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we stayed for four nights and had an absolutely first class experience. nothing was too much trouble! from storing some luggage for us pre-arrival and post departure to sourcing tickets the savoy will do it all. our rooms were fantastic - we had a twin room suite with king sized beds and two bathrooms. we loved the art-deco style, underfloor heating, large wardrobes, solid doors that blocked out any noise. the beds and pillows were comfortable and immaculately clean. the internet was fast and consistent, allowing us to connect 5 devices. afternoon tea delivered by the floor butler and a mountain of towels replenished throughout the day. we had dinner and breakfast at the hotel and the service and the food were outstanding. the afternoon tea in the thames foyer is wonderful. the service and welcome was exceptional and we would easily stay again. of course, it was not inexpensive, but it delivered over and above in terms of our expectations. and the location for shows/theatre is excellent. if you want an classic luxury hotel experience then the savoy would be hard to beat.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''apex london wall is my preferred choice of accommodation when i travel to london for business. the room is clean, and service is great. they are also flexible at times in managing my check out times. the staff is friendly, and they take feedback seriously. i once commented that i did not have bedroom slippers in the room, they made sure that this was provided at every subsequent visit. small things such as this, make a difference to a person travelling on business.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we made our fourth trip to the savoy just after new year, our first since the hotel's refurbishment, and this time incorporating a night at the savoy theatre to see cabaret. slightly spooky experience on being welcomed, when the lady worked out who we were from just a few details in our conversation! swiftly transferred to our room on the art deco side of our floor, although the luggage took a little too long (20 minutes) to arrive. | the rooms have been very sympathetically refurbished, although we found them a little darker than we had remembered (the curse of the energy-saving bulb, perhaps?). great in-room magazine (monocle - wonderfully browsy). | we enjoyed a pleasant pre-theatre dinner with friends, although we had to wait rather a long time to be acknowledged and then seated. delicious bread and very interesting butter (smoked sea salt and curry!) to nibble on. we were slightly anxious that we would be late for the show, but the staff must have known where we were going, as we were all done by 7.10 (service was unobtrusive and calm). it seemed strange that the hard-copy of our package confirmation was required by the waitress, as this information was present on the touch-screen for staff on the entrance to the restaurant. | as the american bar was out of commission the night we were there, we went to the beaufort bar after the show (fantastically dark production, with incredibly talented cast) for cocktails. the only seats were up at the bar, which is actually the best place to be, in prime position for observing the wonderful skills of the mixers, who told us what all the curious things in the jars behind them were. we went for the classiest cocktail in the world (vodka martinis, of course) which were gorgeously dry, one with a twist, one with an olive. they were so good, we ended up having 3 a piece! a wonderful jazz pianist and singer completed the sense of panache. | slept soundly on the most comfortable bed we would been in a long while and enjoyed a nice breakfast overlooking the river. at-table service much preferable to the american style buffet the last time we would been, but never thought to ask for cereal instead of pastries and muffins with the 'full english'. | it was a nice touch, on asking if i could get stamps for our letters from the concierge, to be assured that they would see to it that our letters were posted for us (which they duly were, and received by our respective parents the next day, we found out). | a wonderful trip, and a little bit of luxury all delivered in a very warm and welcoming style by all the staff.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we have always booked to stay at this hotel, and it has always been a pleasure staying here. there was a problem with our reservation through booking.com, so we went to speak to a staff at the front desk. we spoke to ugne and anamaria, they kept their smile on as long as we were there, were really helpful and polite with us. our stay was made better thanks to them.'''",2
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''first time we stayed at the bulgari in london, from the moment you arrive you can see how classy this place is everything is modern and immaculate with a good smell in the foyer, the rooms are stunning and bathrooms sublime. we really enjoyed it and will use again the only disappointment was the fact that the doorman told me the car would be parked in a private garage to then find it the following morning on a single yellow line in the street directly behind it was a sunday morning but honesty would have been nice and i will follow this up with the general manager , you do not expect your car to be found in a street when told would be locked up so glad did not take the other car. | the staff were excellent apart of this , reception staff were brilliant and we used the hotel reception safe which was outstanding like a small bank very private and good. the bar manager was outstanding really looked after us and even organised taxis and took us to front of hotel to see us off, any hotel would want to employ him, he told us he worked at the ivy before and could not have made more of an effort and was proud to work for bulgari. the spa and pool were brilliant and the chnaging rooms had everything you need. | so apart of the parking lies everybody was brilliant also a mention of the concierge he could have not been helpfull .'''",2
The Savoy,"'''what a lovely hotel! from the moment you pull up to the front door, you are greeted with true five star attention. | the staff were delightful, the accommodation luxurious and the hotels amenities were incredible. | i would like to make a special mention of the wonderfully friendly staff in the american bar, they truly were a pleasure to be around and made our stay very memorable.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed for 4 nights on business. excellent location and glad i upgraded to a thames river view room. great service, especially concierge staff. jordon worked hard to secure excellent restaurant bookings for us at top tables. all staff were very friendly. rooms are new, trendy but practical and very quiet. i slept right through a thunderstorm that caused transport chaos! it is a bit w hotels like, but i still really enjoyed my stay.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the mondrian at sea containers is a real jewel on the south bank promenade. the hotel has some incredible and unique design features from the massive ships hull-themed ceiling that sweeps throughout the lobby, to the enormous anchor sculpture and the various other nautical regalia dotted throughout. from the river side you do not get much of an impression of scale, but once inside the hotel is vast and really feels like a luxury escape from the hustle and bustle right outside. the check-in process was swift and friendly, and our request for the highest floor possible had been happily met. the room itself, a river view balcony suite, was even more impressive than expected. the large balcony overlooking the thames, across to st. pauls and beyond to the city, felt incredibly private despite being literally directly above the water, in fact you had to lean right over (not recommended!) to even be able to see the walkway below. it really felt as though we were on board a ship on the water. the suite inside was immaculate, with an enormous bathroom and several beautiful design features that made it feel like a 5 star ships captains berth. little touches like the addition of tealights and lamps to light up the terrace at night really showed that the management had thought about the best way to make the guest feel at home. | we had dinner in the sea containers and whilst the menu is fairly simple, the quality of the food was superb. the seafood platter to start was quite possibly the freshest we have ever tasted, and as part of the sunday dinner package we had the roast chicken which sounds ordinary but was anything but, plus some accompaniments that were equally defiant of their plain description. the service was friendly and the atmosphere in the restaurant even on a sunday evening had a real buzz because of the proximity to the south bank promenade, which you feel close enough to be part of, but removed enough from so that its not intrusive. unfortunately the rooftop bar the rumpus room was closed on sunday but we will definitely be back to try it out another time. | breakfast in the room on monday morning arrived bang on the time requested, exactly as ordered, and was equally as high quality as the night before. we enjoyed it on the balcony watching london come to life again as the working week began outside. | all in all the hotel, staff, food and service were all excellent. the only negative comment i would make is that the in-room cocktail prices listed on the minibar menu in the room were lower (by up to 10) than those shown on the system at checkout, which is something that management may want to look into. |'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''i stayed two nights at this property in may 2012. upon arrival, i was greeted by the bellman and my luggage was promptly handled by the porter and i was led inside. at reception, i was greeted by name and my check-in was handled courteously and efficiently. minutes later i was escorted to my room and provided a quick tour and made sure any questions i had about my accommodations were addressed. the staff presented me with not one, but two welcome plates of fruit which was a nice touch. my room was situated on the 7th floor with a view of deanery street so there was very little street noise but also no view of hyde park. i also did not detect any noise from the hallway or from adjacent rooms. one thing i noticed about the room (#701) was that it had an unusual layout being slightly long and narrow making it feel slightly smaller. some of the furniture appeared well worn and looked like it could use some refurbishment. more importantly, the bed was well kept and comfortable. although the bathroom was large and had excellent toiletries, it is layout was even more quirky and there was no separate shower. on the positive side, i enjoyed my stay, slept well every night and had no issues with comfort, cleanliness, and service at this hotel. | pros: | 1. great location near hyde park, piccadilly circus, pall mall and buckingham palace. | 2. large quiet rooms | 3. comfortable beds. | 4. excellent breakfast. | 5. consistent 5-star service. | 6. variety of on-premise amenities. | cons: | my room had an unusual layout and did not have a separate shower.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''lovely hotel with the best beds ever !! great staff, very attentive, cannot fault them. dining in the savoy grill was a different matter, the place is too cramped &amp; noisy to be enjoyable &amp; my food was bang average. 32.00 for 3 small lamb cutlets which were 50 % fat. not good enough !!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we recently had a pre theatre dinner at the river restaurant prior to going to the savoy theatre to see cabaret with will young- what a great show !! | service in the restaurant was superb as was the food. we had 3 courses including champagne and a bottle of wine. the waiter must of overheard me wishing my wife a ""happy birthday"" as a plate of delicious chocolates and macaroons suddenly appeared decorated with birthday greetings- that is excellent service. at 130 total including service, this was great value and is highly recommended. | i have not rated the rooms as we were not staying at the hotel.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''easy to find from south kensington tube station which is a very short walk. plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby with good fish and chips. great breakfast (self-service) with good selections and staff very friendly. very comfortable room; quiet, comfortable bed. hop on and off bus right in front of hotel. the harrods shopping mall right up the street. bus stations near hotel.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i called ridgemount on 18 april to book for a quad ensuite for jul08, and was advised that there was no available room. but eddie (hope i spelt the name correctly) mentioned that a quad with shared showroom facility is available. i was a little hesitant in confirming the room, when eddie went the extra mile to advise me a couple of other hotel names nearby with similar facilities, and even gave me the contact details. i am very happy with the assistance provided, and am impressed with his sense of service. will stay there if i have the opportunity to do so in future. | gim... from sunny island of singapore'''",2

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''excellent hotel with friendly attentive staff always very happy to help with anything to enhance your stay in london. good location just a short walk from either bank or monument tube station. quieter weekend area as this location serves the bank industry, although if you want more hustle and bustle it can be found a short distance away or accessed via the public transport located practically around the corner, taxi etc too. | very quiet hotel, our sleep was not disturbed at all. ( no sound of doors closing or late revellers returning to their rooms) | excellent standard of food and service. we had breakfast here, the ambience was lovely. staff made you feel so welcome.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''what can one say and where does one start. | we have stayed at other hotels in the fairmont hotel chain which the savoy is part of and each has been stunning and of the very highest standard. we therefore looked forward to experiencing the refurbished savoy even before arrival. | from the moment we stepped out of our cab a doorman took our bags and told us they would be taken to our suite. we then entered and were greeted and taken to more of a lounge to check in. | we were then showed to our suite which was on the top 8th floor and this had fantastic views of the river thames and many of its star attractions. | our bags arrived followed shortly afterwards by our butler who brought in tea and brewed and then served it to us. | the room was large and airy and so well appointed we could have been staying at buckingham palace and not had better. | we had a well stocked bar with snacks, large flat screen tv, wifi, lounging area and dressing area and a well equipped bathroom with a very large tub bath, separate shower room and wc, twin washbasins and so much more. | the bed was extremely comfortable and it is not often one can get a goods nights sleep but we certainly did. | we enjoyed a number of meals in the various hotel venues and i have reviewed these separately. | in the morning our butler brought in our tea and coffee and again brewed and served this. in fact whatever one wanted whether packing or unpacking getting any special items he butler was on hand. | one privacy was respected and entry to our suite was by doorbell not a common knock on the door. | our stay was memorable and will never be forgotten as all the staff go that extra mile to ensure everything is more than perfect. if i could award more stars i would have done so.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we stayed for one night in the marlene dietrich suite which was very nice. in fact everything at the savoy is 'very nice' and the staff are, as one would expect, exceptional at their work. | the only reasons for not giving 5 stars was; a) on our return from the theatre we could not have a night cap in the american bar as they were closing. we, and around eight other guests were turned away. we were offered seating outside the bar to have drinks, but it is not the same. it was a surprise as it was not late. b) the savoy breakfast was not that great. | that aside, we ate at the savoy grill the week before and had a first class meal. in fact one of the best meals out i have had for some time. i would highly recommend it for the quality of the food, the service and the ambience.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my husband and i took the sunday deal as a little escape from a stressful week. everything was better than either of us expected, we both have very high standards of customer service and the mondrian met our expectation. the dinner that comes with the package was greater and more fulfilling than expected plus just amazingly good. the experience that stood out the most was our waiter francesco, who was exceptional. he described the food in a way that you could almost taste it, wanting us to really enjoy of choices. i got so caught up i was trying things i would not normally eat. my husband and i are still talking about francesco and how amazing he was. the only complaint is the buffet breakfast, the offerings were very basic and my husband did not feel that great after. overall the sunday mondrian deal is totally worth the money and we left happy and open to booking again. |'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel conveys a feeling of comfort. the room, while not large provided two easy chairs plus a desk. the bathroom was well equipped and the bath even had powerful squirters (does that make a jacuzzi?). the shower in the bath was as powerful. the only quibble we had was with the bed, which had a good mattress but was unstable, thereby transferring individual movements from the one to the other. breakfast was fine. a great asset was the huge but warm hotel lounge with easy chairs and sofas and good lighting if you wanted to read. the drinks selection was broad and the cocktail choice tempting at reasonable prices. the location is unbeatable for the v&amp;a, harrods, etc.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we stayed for one night on march 21st. we choose a standard room as even these are excellent when staying at a mandarin. we were assigned 810 a beautiful room, looking out on the street, but high enough up for the traffic noise not to disturb, plus harvey nicks is just across the road. the room well exceptionally well furnished, spotlessly clean with all mod cons. large king size bed, bath with rain shower, lots of little touches one comes to expect from a mandarin. we had drinks in the mandarin bar, service was friendly and efficient, drinks a bit pricy, but then you are in knightsbridge, would definitely return.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed at the mondrian for one night last saturday as a base for a theatre visit and the sales. what an excellent choice it was. we arrived long before the official check in time but our room was ready so our car was valet parked and our luggage was taken up to our room by a very charming concierge who like the rest of the staff was very helpful and cheerful. the beds are very comfy and the sleeping areas of the hotel quiet. we returned shortly before 11pm so had small dishes to eat in the den. these were excellent value and i can recommend them. breakfast was a little confusing as it was not properly explained and we had the full breakfast buffet and i only eat fruit and toast. having said that, it is not expensive if you make full use of the dishes on offer. the quirky nature of the hotel furnishings make a pleasant change from the staid offerings of other london hotels, as does the ability to walk straight out on to south bank. some of the views are stunning.'''",2
The Rembrandt,'''i have stayed here on previous occasions and in its locality it is difficult to fault. the staff are helpful and friendly. the location is perfect for knightsbridge and its shopping. the breakfasts are hearty. the room was clean and perfectly well appointed.''',2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i stayed here early january this year for a week and were very happy with the hotel. my sister in law felt ill when she visited, so the concierge offered her a complimentary bed in my suite. we also requested wake-up calls in the morning, which they did (along with complimentary tea and water). the location was perfect, right next to tragalgar square and other tourist attractions. i would highly recommend this hotel over any other in london. breakfast however was not my favorite, there were not many options unfortunately.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''the rembrandt london | we stayed here mid-december so to were able enjoy the christmas atmosphere and the wonderful decorations. due to our room not being ready when we arrived at around 3.30pm, we were offered an alternative room which happened to be for disabled use. this suited us very well as i do have mobility issue and was a good size. the bathroom was very spacious and excellent for those with mobility problems with a huge shower area. everything was immaculately clean and very shiny. complimentary bathrobes and slippers were also available. the king-size bed was very comfortable and the general dcor and general standard of the room was high. | we enjoyed a drink at the bar in a busy and upbeat atmosphere. being a few weeks before christmas the hotel was busy with guests in london to do christmas shopping or just to see the festive sights. we had a selection of sandwiches which were very satisfying and our food and drinks bill was surprising very reasonable. we were booked to eat out at the nearby good earth chinese restaurant later in the evening but the hotel restaurant looked busy. | the next morning we had breakfast in the restaurant. the place was full but tables were being cleared and people seated with no waiting. hot breakfast was plentiful and there was a good section of continental choice. lovely fresh selection of fruits and various cereals were available along with danish pastries and freshly baked rolls. all very satisfying. i also noticed that many people went up a couple of times to have second portions and some piling their plates high ! | although we did not spend a great deal of time in the hotel we very much enjoyed out stay. the staff were polite, especially the porter who had been most helpful, was cheerful and chatty. they seemed to all work well as a team. the standard was excellent and the location was perfect. major museums across the road, kensington and knightsbridge on the doorstep. we will definitely be returning next christmas to take in the festive sights again.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''i came to this hotel on a day visit with my boyfriend from the us. we were both impressed by the look of the hotel lobby and then of the american bar too. i actually just did a post of one of harry craddock's (who wrote the savoy cocktail book) drinks for the leap year on my site http://www.thefussyone.com/leap-year-cocktail so check that out if you are interested. the decor and the staff are excellent there, the drinks we had were perfect and my boyfriend (who came with me) is an american and loved everything about it. the history, good drinks and bar staff dressed so beautifully make it worth the visit.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we chose xenia hotel on the location for visiting kensington palace and the ideal home show. well worth a visit. excellent fast early check in, the room was ready. extremely polite efficient staff on reception and at breakfast. the twin bedroom perfectly compact, a samsung tablet switched on for us with information on the hotel and london. bathroom quite small but all we wanted for a one night stay. nice touch of special toileteries, the beds turned over for us at night and chocolates left for us. the breakfast was excellent, self service or cooked to order, perfectly served! lots of choice. luggage hold facility to enjoy the second day. would recommend this new london hotel and would stay again when in that area of the city. the only negatives were a slightly loose bath tap and the air conditioning unit on the roof outside the bedroom made for the lack of sleep because of the continuous buzzing! it happens with lots of hotels though and seems to be a common problem. overall a lovely hotel and a great weekend.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''having used to live in london and having lots of friends there has meant we have never needed to use a hotel...till our little girl arrived! we decided to treat ourselves for a weekend away with our 17month old lady and boy were we treated!!! felt like superstars from checking in, breakfast, to checking out! special thanks to concierge for looking after us and suggesting baby sitters and places to dine in - absolutely loved our time there and will be back!'''",2
The Savoy,'''stayed for two nights in a river view suite. service was excellent from the greeting by the doormen through to the butler who brought us our tea and cookies at night. the staff make you feel very welcome. must mention that the breakfasts are excellent with a magnificent choice on offer. this was our second visit to the savoy within a year and we have just booked to go back for my birthday on the 19th of february highly recommended.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''everything about the hotel was excellent. the staff was friendly and the room was clean. the option to have breakfast to go was extremely useful as we were able to grab a sandwich when we had a specific time to be somewhere. the fact that they provided a phone with gps and calling was clutch as our phones did not work in england. the only downside was that it was a bit of a hike from the places that we wanted to see. yes, the tube station is close, but we could not just walk to the top places we wanted to see like the tower of london, westminster abbey, or buckingham palace to name a few. it is close to harrods, the natural science museum, and the victoria and albert museum, but those were places that we would want to see on our second or third trip especially with the compact time frame that we were working with. overall it was a very pleasant experience and i would recommend it to other travelers in the future.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''my family just returned from three nights at the savoy, where we were amazed by the quality of the service. when we arrived, we were greeted and introduced to the hotel by one of the staff, who then went to the registration office to bring me my key. there were no lines or paperwork to deal with, which was a relief because it was 8:00am following an overnight flight. i had requested an early check-in, which of course could not be guaranteed, but our room was available, another plus at that hour! we had also requested a rollaway bed for our son which was brought, without charge, almost as soon as we reached our room. the workout clothes i had requested were brought shortly thereafter. turndown service included slippers placed at the foot of each bed. | the service extended to the fountain court where i booked an afternoon tea. when we were finished, the waiter informed me that the tea had been charged to our room. again, there was no need to request or sign a bill. i should mention that, although it is not listed on the menu, when the waiter saw our son, he informed us that they offered a children's tea at half the price of the adult version. | the room itself was lovely, on the fifth floor of the edwardian wing. the bed was very comfortable, and there was plenty of room for clothes storage in the closets and multiple drawers available. the bathroom was quite large and beautiful, although the shower tended to leak excessively onto the floor. the only disappointment with the room. i had requested a city view, but ours was of an inner courtyard. thankfully, however, it was very quiet. | i had let the hotel know this trip was a celebration of my birthday, and they thoughtfully left a plate with a small cake and a birthday greeting in our room. | the location of course is unbeatable, and we would return to the hotel in a heartbeat (and we are very loyal fairmont customers). the only significant lapse was the river restaurant. i had booked breakfast at 10:45am on a sunday. at 10:15 i called to see if we might come down early and was told that would be no problem. however, when we arrived, we were told our table was not ready. a nice feature is the waiting area with complimentary juice, coffee, and pastries, but we sat there until after 10:45. when we were seated, there were a number of empty tables, so we were puzzled as to why we had been kept waiting. a busboy offered us orange juice and peach juice, but when i asked for peach, it turned out to be grapefruit. i had requested a river view, but not only were we not seated at the window, we were placed in the entrance, as far from the river as was possible without being in the fountain court. the food was fine (but did not compare with the less expensive breakfast at the wolseley we had enjoyed the day before). unlike our experience in the fountain court for tea, we found it difficult to attract anyone's attention after we would finished while they were apparently busily setting up for lunch service. | overall, staying at the savoy was one of my (and my family's) all-time favorite travel experiences, and i give the highest possible marks to the courtesy and professionalism of the staff. i will absolutely return, but will obviously dine elsewhere in the future. | we loved our edwardian room, but i am curious to stay in the art deco wing next time!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''lovely, modern room with nice amenities and everything you would need for one night. | great location, lovely view and stunning design. | the front desk staff did blatantly try to up-sell us a 'better' room as we were an hour early to check in and 'our room was not ready yet but a better one was however it would of course cost 100'. we said no thanks and suddenly 'oh look your room has become available, things change so quickly in this hotel...' | breakfast was a little disappointing, just not a massive selection and pretty standard stuff, nothing special. was all quite cold and tasteless too but overall we had a nice stay.'''",2
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''i was very excited to stay at the hotel everything was great i love the staff , concierge, door man , drivers, butler .... but the junior suit was too small to call it suit unless the few ... go for a room if you are looking for space | the thing that disappointed me was .. that we have lost some of our things, it is lost..!!nothing , my self and my sister have lost a pair of branded sunglasses and a gucci shoes and some small stuff .. i did notify the manager at the check out.. that i lost them but i will go home and check.. but really i did lost them at the hotel... it is taken . i called the manager on duty.. he was so rude and spoke to me very strong like am nothing comparing with their rich guests who come to the hotel. i told him if i where someone else.. i wrote my comments without go back to the management... literally he told me go and write.. like he do not care. | it will be my last time there ether to lock up your stuff..or do not stay .'''",2

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''had a single room with shared bathroom 50 per night, free wifi, excellent value, great area. | took the piccadilly line from heathrow direct to russell square and then around 10 steps up from the platform and then an elevator to street level. then about 10 minute walk to hotel (shortcut through the university). when i checked in they kindly carried my rather heavy bag up for me. | room at the back overlooking the garden, some street noise but i did sleep with the window open. | i think breakfast is great and the girls serving were really nice. i bought an oyster card at heathrow because i was staying a week and i used it all the time, great value. | walked to st pancras to get the eurostar because i was leaving during rush hour and could not face trying to get on the tube with all my luggage. the walk took around 20 minutes. would definitely stay there again.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''the hotel is right across the street from the victoria and albert museum. i got a very good rate thru british air that included breakfast. | - 4 minutes in one direction takes you to a tube station on the piccadilly line that comes in from heathrow. very convenient | - 4 minutes in the other direction is harrods, there are many very nice family run hotels between the two locations. | - the rooms were very nice and comfortable. great bathroom with a huge tub to soak in after a long day of walking. the staff was very friendly. wireless in the rooms. they have a very nice bar and the restaurant had a great breakfast.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''it was only a blip at checkin that prevented a rating of excellent - firstly there was a queue at checkin because the process was too slow, then our room was not ready, which at 3.40 pm is poor. after a 15 minute wait however we were upgraded to a lovely suite with amazing river views. after that it was a great stay, the rooftop bar is great fun, breakfast was superb so overall a good stay - they just need to speed up checkin'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my husband and i like to try out different london hotels and after looking on the corinthia hotel website and reading the positive reviews we decided on the corinthia and i am so glad we did! | firstly the location is fab, your walking distance from many of londons great attractions such as st james park, big ben, london eye, westminster, trafalgar square and buckingham palace to name a few. | the hotel itself was everything we hoped it would be, the inside and decor is beautiful and has everything you would expect from a top class hotel, including fast wifi :) | despite having been out for lunch, on arriving back to the hotel we could not resist sitting in the lobby area for a coffee and trying a scone, which was definitely one of the best i have eaten! would really like to do afternoon tea here next time we visit. | i have to mention the spa - it is amazing and definitely has to be used while staying here. unfortunately as we were travelling with a baby we was not able to have any treatments but we did use the swimming pool. the design of the spa was so modern &amp; contemporary and every aspect was so well thought out, the whole thing was just stunning! | the only slight issue i had with the spa area was there was no where with baby changing facilities, so in the changing room trying to get myself ready for swimming and the baby was quite difficult as there is no table or anywhere soft such as a little sofa/bench to put the baby down on. however once i went out to the pool area i found there was sofas next to the pool so next time i would use that to get the baby changed etc. | our room was lovely, we booked into a junior suite which was very spacious with a big walk in wardrobe and a bathroom with a tv in the bath. there was also a nice view of the hotels courtyard and a little balcony you can stand outside on. | in the evening we did not get a chance to eat in the hotel restaurant, all the swimming and walking around had tired the baby out so we decided to make the most of our lovely room, order in room service and relax. the food itself was nice but like many london hotels the room service was ridiculously expensive, although i would say corinthia was perhaps even more expensive when comparing it to the other london 5* hotels i have visited. i still do not understand how anyone can justify 5 for a can of coke! also as we were spending the night in the room we thought we would watch a movie, however the cost of watching one was 20! once again i just could not justify that to watch a film, i could buy the film for half that price so out of principle i said i did not want to hire one. i have been to many hotels that offer complementary movies, its just a nice little touch especially as it does not cost the hotel anything for a guest to watch it so i was disappointed that this service was not offered. | breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant was lovely, definitely up there with one of the best breakfast selections i have seen, there is literally everything you could possibly want for breakfast. we really enjoyed what we ate, however we did have a little issue with our order not coming out right and when we brought this to the waitresses attention she did not even apologise and it took about 15 minutes for the rest of our order to come out (the breakfast was missing the sausage, hash brownand beans) however despite this little blip it was still a lovely breakfast. | overall our experience of this hotel was a very positive one, in general the staff were lovely and very welcoming, always greeting you with a smile and a 'hello' but something that i thought was particularly lovely was my son was left a present in his cot - a little soft toy and baby bath products. this was so thoughtful, please pass on my thanks to whoever would have arranged this. its things like this that make this hotel a very special place to visit, and we will definitely look forward to returning here in the future.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my hubby and i have just returned from my birthday weekend in london. it is our second time staying at the mondrian and it did not disappoint. the vibe in this hotel is classy and friendly and certainly not stuffy. free wifi, great bars (we loved the rumpus room with its awesome cocktails and fabulous views over london) and well equipped rooms. a special thank you to luke nell, the guest experience manager, for making our stay extra special with a complimentary round of cocktails. i think this will become a yearly pilgrimage. we will most certainly be back.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''funky with a newly-converted feel, this is a very good place to stay for visitors as well business people. the room was a decent size, though the window from my side facing room was overlooked by hundreds of office workers. very good mini bar and extras at a cost. disappointed the roof bar was not open on monday - the day i stayed.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''....unfortunately, despite a wonderful stay and being a huge fan of the fairmont brand, i am just not able to. | we booked the sunday best package (accommodation, breakfast and dinner in the river restaurant). so had a lot of other people it seemed! pre-arrival the hotel both called me and emailed to ask what time we would be checking in and i answered both. check-in is from 2pm but since we were planning to do some shopping beforehand i opted for around 3pm. on arrival we were checked in and told our room was not ready but were offered the use of a complimentary hospitality suite with free drinks and snacks while we waited. i was impressed that the hotel had a solution to the problem but clearly the hotel management knew they were going to have an issue. when we entered, there were several other guests also waiting for their rooms to be made available, some more stressed about it than others. it was not a long wait, about 30 mins, and two glasses of champagne made it go very quickly! we had booked a deluxe twin room. it was not large but this is london and it was very well appointed with ipod dock, loewe television and surround sound in the bathroom. the hospitality tray i would ordered pre-arrival was not there but this was rectified - after an ironing board that we had not requested had been delivered and our shopping that was left with the luggage while we were waiting for our room was found after going astray for several minutes! all very minor incidents but a sign that the hotel was not quite coping with the number of guests who had descended at the same time. | we had a late lunch in the bar just off the thames foyer, the best club sandwich i think i have had anywhere. also fabulous was the on-site chocolatier - i would recommend trying some of these wonderful creations. unfortunately dinner in the river restaurant was not quite up to the same standard. after a delayed start caused by a 30 minute wait for two cocktails in the american bar, the food was hit and miss. whilst we happened to make the best choices from the menu, several tables around us were unhappy with their food and returned it. in particular there seemed to be an issue with soggy pastry. some tables were brought petits fours, some were not. we were not offered any tea or coffee, it did not particularly matter as we had it available in our room but if you were not staying in the hotel you might find this haphazardness irritating. | breakfast the next morning, again in the river restaurant, was a strange affair. i ordered the english breakfast which was supposed to come with toast and a range of pastries etc. my mother ordered the corn beef hash and some fruit to start. we would have thought that the two hot dishes would be served together but they brought her fruit and my bacon and eggs at the same time but could not bring me any toast until afterwards and then served my mother's hot dish while i was finishing my coffee. i never got my pastries. the lovely people at the next table who we got talking to were served cereal with no milk! it was funny more than anything else but not really what is expected in such an iconic luxury hotel. | i am far from being a tolerant person and normally these continuous minor issues would have begun to irritate me. it was a testament to the staff that i still came away feeling as though the experience was wonderful. yes they got things wrong, yes they were clearly unable to deal with the numbers of guests but it was not for the want of trying of everyone working there. rarely do you feel that hotel staff genuinely care about your experience, they truly did at the savoy and with slightly stronger management this hotel could be the best ever. my recommendations would be to change the check-in and check-out times to give themselves a fighting chance and to review the set-up in the river restaurant which is probably the main thing that let us the hotel down. | overall though, would i return? yes i would, because somehow, the place is still very very special.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed for a night with wife and child. staff were very attentive and helpful upon arrival and was swiftly taken to my room. requested a rollaway for my 3 year old and they delivered with lightning speed. room is very comfortable and the bed was incredible - i would say that some of the fixtures, particularly in the bathroom are looking a little tired, but then this is a historical hotel - so its hard to have one without the other. the room was a little dark - this was great for lazing in bed, although if i were to stay longer i am not sure i would ever get any work done. all in all i really liked this hotel - and the breakfast was amazing. i ate raspberries to the equivalent of $10000000 in australia. the view from breakfast over the park was great too.'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''stayed here this weekend as a little break. the hotel is the old ministry of defence building and war office on whitehall but no sign of it now obviously!! | arrival in the car was as easy as it could be in london traffic and the doorman quickly took the car to be parked whilst another showed us to the reception desk. this was all straight forward and a lovely receptionist took us up to our 5th floor room and once in showed us around it | the rooms are great - spacious with good sized bathrooms with separated wc and shower as well as double sinks and massive deep bath with a tv in front of it so you do not get bored! | bed was massive and comfortable and the mini bar good. a nespresso machine is always a nice touch with a good selection of teas and coffees. | a couple of wardrobes with the usual safe etc. i do wish that these hotels would automatically put an iron and board in - i always find it really frustrating that you have to ask and then wait for it - or, have housekeeping iron for you which i am sure is a good money making service but not terribly convenient. | the room had a small balcony and it made a nice change to be able to keep the balcony doors open to let some air in - it was quite a warm night. | breakfast is until a very civilised 11am on the weekend and offers a hot and cold buffet as well as al a carte and even some dim sum!. everything was delicious, from the bacon sandwich to the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs with brioche. tea, coffee and juice readily replaced if you want it and service was efficient and friendly. | thoroughly enjoyable weekend and would happily stay here anytime!'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''although this hotel is on the other side of the water, it is still a fabulous hotel to stay in. there are loads of bars and restaurants to keep you occupied and the rumpus room bar on the 12th floor at the hotel is a great place to start (and finish) as it is cool personified. anthony the concierge was extremely helpful with reserving us a table at a fine restaurant across the water and it was only 11 and a short taxi ride to get there. walking out the front of any hotel and being right on the water is always a cool experience and the fact that you get this experience with this hotel and whichever way you go (left or right) there are plenty of things to see and do. this was not our first visit to the mondrian london and most definitely will not be our last. #discflipper'''",2

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we stayed at this hotel for one night on 15th september as part of a birthday treat for my husband. i have never before encountered such attentive staff as i did at the apex london wall. i had emailed them prior to our arrival to ask about tube stops etc and mentioned it would be my husband's birthday. they really went the extra mile to ensure his birthday was special with free room upgrade to a suite, card, chocolates and vouchers to be used at the hotel bar. nothing was too much trouble and the staff we spoke to were all extremely helpful, cheerful and obviously happy in their work.the suite was wonderful and the bed very comfortable we will definitely return. thank you to all the staff who made our stay special.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''stayed here a few times. | from check in, afternoon tea, seeing our suite for the first time, eating in the restaurants and drinking in the bars the staff were attentive and made you feel welcome. | i stayed here for my 50th birthday and was spoilt by the hotel and staff. they made it special and both my wife and i had a great time. | our room was a junior suite with views over the thames. | the position of the hotel being so close in proximity to covent garden makes it an ideal base. | the only place i did not feel comfortable, was the savoy grill. the waiters were great but the food was a little below par for example 40 for a 300g sirlion steak with 100g of it being fat and a yorkshire pudding that tasted like it had been reheated from lunch. we spent 20 mins trying to get the matre ds attention as he kept looking straight through us so my actual 50th birthday meal was disappointing. | apart from that, kaspers, the thames foyer, beaufort and american bars were great.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this was my second stay here. first time was with my daughter for a girls' weekend and this time was a friday night stay with my husband. | i would love to have given this hotel five stars as it is a wonderful place to stay but a couple of things still let it down. | i checked in before my husband on friday afternoon and was given an upgrade to an executive room which was stunning. the rooms here are precisely what you would expect from a luxury hotel. the bedroom was beautifully appointed and the bathroom impressively luxurious. | both my husband and i had spa appointments on friday afternoon. i had a facial and my husband had a massage. this spa is beautiful and continues to be my favourite world wide. we had booked dinner outside the hotel but decided to enjoy a cocktail in the northall bar before we left. | on the plus side the cocktails were delicious and my husband (extremely knowledgeable on the cocktail front) said that his lychee and rose martini was possibly the best he had ever tasted, better even than the martinis at dukes hotel which is high praise indeed. unfortunately having been seated and our order taken we then had to wait ten minutes and tell the barman three times that we had already placed our order - this is not the level of service you would expect in a hotel of this standard. | the following morning after an excellent night's sleep we went to the northall for breakfast. we were seated promptly and asked if we wanted the a la carte menus for breakfast. we asked if we could have a look at these. we then asked for the menus on three separate occasions before receiving them. having finally received them we waited another 15 minutes trying to catch someone is eye to order. in the end, not wanting to waste our morning, we gave up and helped ourselves to the buffet breakfast. this was delicious but we wanted the opportunity to order the a la carte menu and the service was chaotic. again not what you would expect from a hotel of this standard. the staff seemed flustered and unable to cope with the breakfast rush. | on a more positive note we were able to have a late check out with no problems and our car was brought promptly from the garage on request. | this hotel is in a wonderful location and the accommodation is superb. we will definitely stay again because of this and the beautiful spa but as a five star hotel it needs to work on its' service issues.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i had the luck to stay here for a business trip in february. it was just fantastic! expect a bathroom with the nicest fresh amenities and a huge shower, a modern decorated room with a great flat screen and a soft bed, even supplied with a european power outlet for those like me who forget their uk converter! and!! tadaaa: a golden fortune cookie! lol!! you will love this hotel even more if you like boats, water and water transportation! as a student i have lived on an old shipyard, so this hotel reminded me of it but then in a very very luxury way. i was surprised how you can integrate old ship parts and even the bow of a big ship in a hotel building. what an amazing reception desk! the hotel is also located near all touristy things in london. the only bad thing i can think about is the length of their beds. they are way too short for me being 1.90m/6ft2. anno 2015 this is not necessary anymore, especially in a hotel in this price category. also the breakfast is relatively simple for the price. but it is london, so everything is pricey.'''",2

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''so this is the nth time i have been to this hotel over the last decade due to a magnitude of hospital appointments over the decade from cancer treatment. i have also been to quite a few of the others on the same street when the ridgemount is fully booked up. but this is always my first port of call when in london. i have been here on my own, with family, and with my partner in competely seperate occasions. | the hotel is in a 150 year old building, so expect a bit of slanty floors,narrow corridors and staircases as this was the design of the victorian era and the building have settled not perfectly flat (all the ones on the street suffer from this). its nice to have some legacy to a building, which can be rare nowadays with all these modern high risers. | i have tried both the ensuite and shared bathroom rooms over the years, and never had any issues with either. they are albit a little small, with enough space for the bed, table, tv, clothes cupboard, chair and washbasin (non ensuite) with a bit of room to walk around, but this is also linked to the buildings legacy and therefore cannot really expect anything more. | the double glazing removes most of the ambiant street noise, but this is london, so expect a little to get though, esp as the road is a rather busy one. the rooms are always lovely and warm, and the windows are openable if needed, though i find i do not even need to sleep under all the covers, just the thin top one suits me fine. the bed is lovely and is one of the few places where i can fall alseep almost as if at home. the entire building is always spotless, never had a issue with the cleaniness of the hotel. | the kichen staff are lovely, swift service, and always willing to canter to your breakfast needs. the breakfast can consist of bacon, eggs, roast tomatoes, cerial, fruit juice, tea or coffee and toast, lots of toast. the only complaint i can come up with is that in the past (mentioned been coming here for a long time) i am sure there ust to be sausages and beans, but that is only a little thing. | there is a free wifi which you can pick up anywhere in the building (grand feat being victorian builds usually eat wifi signal for breakfast) but also you can access eduroam wifi from the building as well (eduational roaming wifi which is avilable for academics from most universities). | there is a communal area which has changed over the years, its now much more spacious and has 3 setees each of which can hold 3 people happily. there is computer access which is free, and a vending machine for soft pop (50p can of cola!! that is 1/2 price nearly) and a free tea/coffee machine which i always enjoy. | the respection staff are great and have a lovely bed side manner, must admit that i have asked some stuipd questions over the years to them, and they have asked me stuff when i have been soooooo tired i could not chain words together and we have never had issues understanding each other. | there is a log book in the main corridor which i recommend signing when you leave. | given the legacy, the price (which is approx 1/4 of the high street hotels in the area [ibis, travel inn etc]), and the location (its close by to a collection of underground stations, 5-10 mins walk from euston train station, and inportant to me, 2-5 mins walk from the uclh hospital) id say this is a perfect hotel. | if you want spanky shiney new builds, or to pay out your nose for the room, this is not the place for you, if you want good quality, friendly staff, and respectfully priced hotel in a legacy building for a base for hospitals/touristing then serious consideration should be made here.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we are one night into a four night stay. from a wonderful check in to our beautifully spacious bedroom that is big enough to ride a bike around, the whole experience has been awesome. i cannot recommend this hotel enough! le labo bathroom products are the icing on the proverbial cake and the american bar is as iconic as you would imagine......'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we picked this hotel due to its location, price and the fact you had use of the uk's number 1 hotel spa included! it is a superb 5 star hotel, very centrally located yet in a quiet thoroughfare. the staff are also 5 star from the moment you arrive at the door to the second you leave. nothing was too much trouble to any member of staff. the room we had was fantastic and offered every possible touch you would expect of a top class hotel but with a little bit more. breakfast buffet was excellent, house keeping was superb and with a great spa on top we cannot wait to return. special thanks to jaime in front office too. if you are looking for a special treat in london, or cannot decide on a 5 star hotel to stay, i would recommend this as a perfect place to stay'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''efficient and friendly check in, everything explained regarding times for breakfast, restaurent, bar. room on 4th floor very clean and spaceous, beds very comfy. found the bathroom to be a little small but the shower was very good. | had a late night cocktail in front of an open fire good way to end the day. breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice if you wanted continental or english the food was cooked well and was hot with plesent non obtrusive service. | idealy located for museums and harrods, tube stations near by but we enjoyed walking into london centre plenty to see on route. stayed in a few london hotels and found this one to be one of the better ones for an all round experience'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''fascinating suite overlooking the thames. absolutely love the interior, especially the tom dixon features throughout the hotel. the bathroom sure had that 'wow' factor. toiletries were divine and are one of my favourite brands available in space nk. the rumpus room has spectacular views over the rooftops of london, and dandelyan on the ground floor plays a good selection of music. great place to people watch on the south bank. little let downs....upon checking in to the room, my boyfriend walked in on the man stocking the bar. he believes he is responsible for also leaving a fortune cookie in the room, which we did not get. also the concierge apparently booked us a table in rumpus, but they had no details of this upon our arrival and all tables were booked. so, not impressed with the lack of care taken there. concierge could do with a bit more training. thankfully, it was not a special occasion!'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,'''very nice and kind staff. great breakfast. just a short walk from the underground station goodge street. not far from regents park either. i did some nice jogging there during our stay. secure place with locked entrance door and 24 hours manning.''',2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''stayed at this hotel for a wedding in july! from arrival to leaving the staff were excellent! the rooms were so comfortable and spotless yet very trendy. huge flat screen tv and most comfortable bed, had a amazing nights sleep. and it was great to wakeup and be served such a delicious breakfast! you help yourself to pastries, fruit, cereal etc and order your hot part with everything you could want including full english, eggs benedict, smoked salmon n much more! | when it was time to leave to local tube is a two minute walk and we was in euston square in under ten minutes for our train home. | really impressed over all and had a lovely stay there while on a special visit to london!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we went to the hotel for one night during birthday celebrations , and must say , though its expensive, and on paper, the rooms do not really match up so well to the cost, the overall experience is definitely worth the money . the historic surroundings, pictures of famous guests past and present, the service, the staff making every guest feel like they are in a first class lounge , all add up to a memorably worthwhile stay . the decor is absolutely unbelievable, the rooms, though quite small are furnished to the highest possible standard . at the price they should have bathroom tv's , but you tend to overlook these things because the sum of all the various parts of the savoy are so classy it is hard to be too critical . the american bar had a great piano player to listen to while we enjoyed post dinner cocktails , and the real key of a great hotel is how well you can sleep, and i must say it was one of our best nights rest in ages, top marks to a wonderful hotel .'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''my daughter and me had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. the staff was helpful, friendly and polite. the room was small, but nice, quiet and clean. we enjoyed the meals we had there in a quiet atmosphere. we had breakfast every day and one lunch and one dinner. we would very mush like to come back!! |'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''after visiting the mondrian with my husband for a romantic night away we decided to treat our children to a family lunch. we were made to feel very welcome, especially when we saw luke who had looked after us so well on our previous visit and he actually recognised us. that is what i call first class customer service!! | we were shown to our table and the staff were incredibly attentive and made recommendations to the children as to what they would like. needless to say all 5 of us had the burger yum, with several sharing starters. i have to be honest and say it is not something we could afford to do on a regular basis but for a treat it is really a memorable and special place. thanks again.'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''had an overnight hotel &amp; theatre break at the corinthia. | it is brilliantly located a short distance from trafalgar square, westminster &amp; the bridge across to the london eye. | when you first get there, it is very stylish but not overly stuffy. our room was an executive room with a small balcony overlooking the central courtyard. it had a large bathroom &amp; dressing room. the hotel gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for our anniversary which was a lovely touch. breakfast was either choose 'a la carte' english or buffet. | the real 'wow' factor came from the spa. we used it twice &amp; it is the most sumptuous we have seen. the real highlight being the 'vitality pool' basically a small swimming pool sized jacuzzi. the best we have encountered anywhere. | if there are negatives (&amp; i am being picky), hotel prices are very expensive &amp; they claim there are no check-in &amp; check-out times. but 2 people came to our door on our day of leaving to see if we would left &amp; both before 11.15. | the staff were actually lovely &amp; if you want a classy hotel brilliantly located &amp; do not mind paying a few pounds extra (it is better than the royal horseguards across the road), then this is for you.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''i attended a conference at imperial college and stayed at the hotel. the room condition was excellent, the staff very friendly and efficient, and breakfast was very good, with possible variations around english breakfast. the hotel is next to a number of museums, perfect for accompanying persons and also for the conference participant, if time allows. i would definitely stay there again.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we arrived in london much earlier than expected but were able to leave our bag at the hotel. all the staff were friendly and helpful. | our room was of a good size, with a small table and two chairs. it was very clean, the bed comfortable and quiet. the only criticism of the room was that it was very hot, we did have air conditioning which worked well and brought down the temperature but as soon as the air con went off the temperature went back up quickly. as all air cons are noisy, it was to loud to have on during the night, although one night we turned it on for a while. | the best part of our stay was the buffet breakfast, what can we say but wow. there was so much choice. you could eat as much as you wanted from cereal to full cooked english to meats, cheese, pt, fresh fruit. i could go on but i think you get the picture. all laid out beautifully on a large buffet table in the restaurant and cooked to perfection. | would we stay again, yes. we had to vacate the room before our trip was over but again we could leave the bag in reception for collection later in the day, this was so helpful. thank you rembrandt for a great stay.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''our first stay at the mondrian, will not be the last ! we were recommended it by friends and so pleased they did. the decor of the hotel public areas we really appreciated....the room was very comfortable and a great nights sleep had. the staff were all without exception amazing...how the management have put together such a team is unbelievable ...a real compliment for all the team and congratulations to the management !! breakfast was very good. location, for what we had planned was fabulous. | thank you all.'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''stayed at the rembrandt for one night as we were attending a gig at brixton academy which is only 25 minutes away by tube. nice easy check in and check out process and comfortable room if a little small, but hey.. . this is london hotel rooms. all staff were very polite and helpful and the bar area is a nice space to relax in after a long day. breakfast was fresh, plentiful and tasty. | i would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to visit the museums which are all in close proximity. the local bar and restaurant scene is vibrant with plenty of choice for all tastes. | i would definitely stay again!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''great hotel... great service... great location... | my wife and i stayed at the savoy when we stayed in london last week... the hotel is a classic... service beyond our expectations... the tea service was out of this world (and we are not ""tea people"")... great location, close to the covent... nothing to improve...'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''i stayed here for two nights for my wedding which was nearby. from the outset the service could not have been better. i was invited to come and view the rooms and choose the suite that would work best, staff answered lots of emailed questions ahead of time, and after arriving nothing was too much trouble. the reception staff helped with booking black cabs, directing florists, bridesmaids and make up artists to my room, and answered all requests quickly and happily. the bar was even kept open late for us to celebrate with our guests! i really cannot recommend this hotel enough for any occasion.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''overal, the hotel is lovely. the lobby area is spacious and i love the ship ""hull"" design of the check-in desk together with the low lights and gold throughout. the holographic figures in the lifts are also good fun!. in terms of the rooms- the size is good- love the products (as with all morgans hotels) and it is unusual to have cut glass glasses in the room alongside the grey and pink theming. also, we were on the 12 floor, just along from the rumpus room, yet there was no noise. | my only gripe- and unfortunately for me it is a big one- i just wish the hotel was ""more"" central... it is fairly close to the tube but for the moment there is very little around the area- other than building sites and, of course, the oxo tower. i like walking straight out of the hotel into the middle of things, which is not possible here- but aesthetically and service-wise... all very good!.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we treated our 2 adult sons to a vacation in london in may for 8 nights. we booked 2 art deco suites and reservations ensured that our rooms were near to each other---the boy's room was down a small flight of stairs and around the corner from our room, which was just perfect. housekeeping and turndown service are top notch. i sometimes find that housekeeping will start to lag when we are staying for an extended time but not here. | because we had booked suites, we were entitled to several ""perks"", one of which was butler service. they contacted us before we left home to get our flight details and to see if we had any special requests that they could help out with. any questions or concerns i had were well taken care of. another ""perk"" that came with the suites was the use of the hotel cars if available, one a rolls, the other a bentley, for local trips as welll as for pick up and drop off at the airport (prearranged). we were able to use them twice and the drivers were most accommodating in talking about the cars they were driving. the butlers we had during our stay were friendly but professional and went out of their way to make us feel at home and to make sure our stay experience was exactly how we envisioned it to be--nothing was too much trouble for them and they had lots of recommendations and suggestions for us. | | melba's (the new coffee shop) was great for our one son who is an early riser and requires coffee to get going--reasonable prices too. he also tried a sandwich and a pastry and he said they were delicious. they even have a coffee card to earn a free coffee. our son did not quite meet the requirements to get his free coffee so he gave his card to someone else. we ate breakfast each morning in kaspars except for one morning when we had to have room service because we had an early tour and kaspars was not open--room service arrived exactly at the time we requested it and with everything we ordered. we had dinner one night in kaspars and one night in the thames foyer and we were impressed with both the food and service--servers remember you and what you like. one son has several food allergies and it was never any trouble to have the staff check on ingredients for him. kitchen staff made sure that what was served to him was what he could eat even if it meant they had to prepare something special. we had drinks and appetizers in the beaufort bar once and drinks in the american bar on our last night as a splurge. we enjoyed the music in both bars and service was great. | to finalize, i think what made our stay so enjoyable and memorable was the staff. it did not seem to matter who you dealt with from valet at the front, to check out and everyone in between, because they were all so personable, accommodating and yet very professional. | i do not understand why the savoy does not have a higher rating because it is certainly deserving of one. i do not normally write reviews on travel sites (always read them though), preferring to contact the hotel directly with my comments, but after our amazing stay, i am making an exception. | this is a beautiful hotel and the renovations have only enhanced it is grand character. it is in a perfect spot to see things, alot of which are walkable. the thames is close by and we used the hop on/hop off boat one day to go all the way down the river to greenwich. we also walked over several bridges close to the hotel--discovered all sorts of things by doing this. do not forget to come in the ""back door"" and use the red elevator. there is also a pretty little park out back and the hotel is close access to the victoria embankment. we can hardly wait to return !!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this hotel exceeded my expectations. the room was very comfortable and while not big it was well laid out and felt very upmarket. the bed itself was very comfortable with a deep mattress that was supportive without being hard. a really nice touch were the ""proper"" coathangers rather than those awful captive things so prevalent in other hotels. the towels were very large and soft. | decor throughout the hotel is very designer with a nautical theme. i loved it. my wife was not quite so impressed. the view from the hupstairs bar towrds st pauls is amazing. the staff were helpful, frielndly and courteous. | if i could afford it i would happily live there.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''i took my mum here for breakfast and we had a lovely experience. unfortunately we got sat in the breakfast area rather than the thames foyer, but we had a very nice coffee and basket of pastries. everyone there was very polite and helpful, the lady in the boodles jewellers there let me try on an 8000 ring - we were made to feel very welcome. it met all our expectations. i would go back'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my 2nd visit was even lovelier than the first. superior room with well stocked mini bar, and good facilities. delicious breakfast in the sea containers restaurant, which has fantastic views of st pauls and the river. had the wyld afternoon tea in the dandelyan and it was the best afternoon tea i have ever had - delicious! lovely friendly and helpful staff. will hopefully be back for my 3rd visit soon.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this is a beautiful london hotellots of competition in london and the corinthia is near the top. it has a lovely restaurant, classy bar, and large modern well-appointed rooms. what made this trip for us to london perfect was the location of the hotel for watching the fireworks on new year's eve. we literally walked out of the hotel and had a great view. we did not have to wait for hours out in the cold to get one of the best views in the city. if you are not from london, i highly recommend spending new year's at the corinthia. additionally, the hotel provided us front row grand stand seats for the parade the next day--this was complimentary! other guests in the stands said, ""how did you get these seats?"" as they seemed a bit surprised that two american tourists sat down with those that had been part of parade preparations. again, no waiting along the parade route for a good view we just walked down at start time and took our seats. yes, the hotel is close to the tube and inexpensive eateriestwo musts when travelling. we were really treated first class it was money well spent for a great new years in london. highly recommend the corinthia for any time of year and all types of travelers.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i have found the mondrian to be a reliable business hotel during stays in london. it is convenient to the city, has nice rooms and a passable gym. the restaurant is very nice and the vibe welcoming. | the rooms are good, sometimes very good. and i like the staff. | so, all in all, a good bet.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''came up to london for a birthday party at the ivy.our first choice,the dorchester was some 600 more than the savoy so that is how we came to stay there! | and we are so pleased that we did. the american bar we were able to appreciate more as a hotel guest,rather than the quick in and out before going on somewhere else. the waiting staff there could not have been more friendly and efficient,especially manuel and carolis who really are an asset. | the savoy grill was amazing value for a city centre restaurant. less than half of what we paid at alain ducasse at the dorchester last year. | all in all a lovely weekend;one we are hoping to repeat in january. | our new first choice when in london'''",2

Rhodes Hotel,"'''we stayed at the rhodes hotel for the first time for just one night recently. the hotel itself is in a very central location - with paddington station / underground literally about a 5 minute walk away. hyde park and kensington park are also very close by. we had a twin room in the hotel's annexe building which was round the corner from the main hotel. our room was quite small but very clean and had a large flat screen television. the small bathroom with shower had shampoo, shower gel etc. we were surprised to find a fridge in the room, together with tea and coffee making facilities. breakfast is continental in the little breakfast room in the main hotel - a good selection of fresh fruit, cereals, toast, yoghurts, croissants, pain au chocolat, cheese, ham, etc but you can pay an extra 6 for a fried english breakfast if you wish. the staff were all very friendly and helpful. overall, really fantastic value for money if you are looking for a basic, no frills, clean but central london hotel. we would definitely stay here again!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''the savoy experience: exceeds expectations, service combined with style, professional and proactive. savoy is expensive and worth it (even with the dollar-gbp exchange rate!). | it starts on arrival and being greeted by name. lobby is a step beyond beautiful and rooms match. although savoy was sold out most of the nights i stayed, it never felt full or busy. dining at breakfast was classy and comfortable. i tried most everything on the menu during my week long stay. | afternoon was excellent---see that review. | i found it offensive to be charged for wifi. at these prices, please bury the minimal cost of wifi service. to charge for wifi lacks style and substance!'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''not much to say really, does what it says on the box. amazing decor and wonderfully friendly staff. the bar is wonderful. the restaurant we found ok and the rooms very comfortable if a little unexciting (compared to say the rosewood where they are just a little more edgy and cool without losing the comfort factor). the breakfast delivered to the room was the only let-down. i mean it was fine but we have had better at this type of hotel. the spa is another level and we spent hours there hanging out after treatments. it is pretty pricey but the spa might just make it worth it...just.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''my husband and i stayed here for 5 days and would thoroughly recommend this hotel. we had a room on the 2nd floor, which had a queen bed, leather couch and a spa bath. this was in the dearest price category, but well worth the extra money. although the hike up to our room was tiring after a hard day's sightseeing, we knew before we came that there was no lift and that we would be on the 2nd floor. we had a large flatscreen tv, small fridge and a/c, which we actually used some of the time. the bathroom was small, but not tiny, and very modern and new-looking. the couch gave us room to spread out a bit, and even had a footstool. we overlooked the street, but as there was double-glazing, noise was not an issue. | we really appreciated the free internet, having been away from home for 7 weeks, and this is our preferred mode of communication. breakfast was plentiful, and every morning chris made me a banana crepe. my husband occasionally had extras, like bacon or eggs, at no extra charge. | the location of the hotel is excellent, being close to paddington station, which is on a number of tube lines. there were also plenty of buses. the hotel booked us a car pickup from heathrow, which was not much dearer than a shuttle, and certainly quicker and more comfortable. with less luggage, we would even be tempted to use the heathrow express, and then walk to the hotel. | chris and maria, the proprietors, were both very helpful and friendly. all emails i sent prior to booking were answered promptly. this is our 5th visit to london and the hotel is by far the best value of places we have stayed, and will be our hotel of choice on any future visit.'''",2
London Guest House,"'''i had a tiny room for 3 nights, but everything was clean, breakfast was good and had a big variety you can choose of. from the room you can hear the traffic, but the windows are very good, so i heard the traffic only at a low level. it is not perfect but for this price it is great. | the staff is very friendly and helpful (more than you can expect) | the only flaw that prevents me for giving 5 points were two defect bulbs (at the top of the bed and the bath mirror). it is a tiny issue but sort of annoying. | but if you do not mind little traffic noise and small rooms, i can warmly recommend this hotel. | reinhard, vienna, austria'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed at the mondrian at sea containers for my wife's birthday (november 2015) the hotel is well located on the south bank with a short walk (approx 5 mins) to waterloo station, southwark underground or blackfriars (over the bridge) which give you access to 6 out of 10 underground lines! | as you approach the building you are greeted by friendly staff who kindly carry your bags to the check in desk, the check in for us was faultless, they asked if we preferred a high or low floor and we were given the option to upgrade although this was at a cost. we declined and was told that was fine but if we changed our mind to call down and they will arrange for us to be moved. the decor in the lobby and corridors were superb and modern and this was continued once we entered our room. | the room was plenty spacious enough with a king size bed, very large flat screen tv on the wall, modern decor through out and a bathroom to die for as well as some of the nicest complimentary shower gels and creams i think i have ever had in a hotel. we had a city view room which i think is a little rich as you are looking at some buildings which are over the road but i suppose that is poetic license and what to expect in a city with as many tall buildings as london has. | the mini bar seemed very expensive but it did have some unusual items that i have not seen for sale in a hotel room before including the bedding (260) and an intimacy pack (20) | the house keeping and room service were excellent and all the staff we interacted with were pleasant and happy. | the spa consists of a relaxation room, treatment room and then separate male and female steam rooms, this is good in the fact you do not need to wear clothing in there if you wish however make sure you have discussed when you plan to leave with your partner so one is not sat waiting for ages for the other to leave! | it rained on a couple of days we were there and we were offered complimentary umbrellas as we left to keep dry. | this hotel has a late check out of midday which seems a luxury these days in the hotel world | book early and you can get some great deals at this place and when you think you can spend 130 + per night for a run down hotel in london i think it is genuinely worth the extra bit of cash for the best nights sleep i have had in a while! i will be coming back here again when we are next in london!'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''hotel is very near earl's court underground, 10 minutes maximum. neighbourhood is very nice and there are several restaurants around that looks quite good. | the staff is very nice and polite; the room very comfy and clean; breakfast is so good!! | great choice if you want to have a perfect experience in the city.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''this is not my first review of the mandarin oriental hong kong but frankly it continues to impress. it provides the finest accommodation, service and facilities in london. never cheap but always worth the price. during my stay i must compliment miko and francois - xavier on the concierge desk they ably handle all requests. i can find little to take exception with at the mandarin | actually i shall return next week'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''it really is one of the great hotels and, unless you are the sort of person who may take this level of surrounding/service for granted, a real treat. small observations: on the odd occasion when not busy too many staff can cluster and then try to be overhelpful (gets quite wearysome). i also think it a great mistake to put staff with a more limited command of english on reception - i completely get the need for multi-cultural approach (especially languages) but having to slowly go through a simple check-in, courteous though it was, is rather odd.the dorchester is a great london hotel and i believe it is totally right that it be fronted accordingly.'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my boyfriend booked to take me here for afternoon tea for valentine's day and we both had an amazing time. we would like to have stayed overnight, but unfortunately for now, the rooms are a bit out of our budget - though we will be back to stay! staff could not do enough for us and were only too happy to make our sandwiches as a special order (i am fussy and do not like sauces in sandwiches) - so the staff put all the sauces in little containers seperately so my boyfriend could use sauce for his sandwiches - such a special touch. also, our waiter was lovely - such a credit to your hotel. great service and cannot wait to come back. food was lovely and the waiter even got the kitchen to add some red onion to our cheese sandwiches. cannot wait to come back - hopefully very soon :)'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''i am a stuffy and particular traveller -- but the rembrandt largely delivered on its promise. first, the value is excellent. i booked the hotel through hotelassist and nailed a 109 rate for a quiet executive room (large room, mostly redone with modern new bath). get the rooms toward the back or overlooking the central garden (of the homes next door -- south kensington is one of the priciest locales in london, and so the neighboring homes are a delight). the location cannot be beat -- see the other reviews. the v&amp;a is totally under-rated and right across the street. note it is open 'til 10 pm on weds. -- great way to beat the crowds. be sure to walk around the area -- the restaurants are great in any direction; harrod's is 10 minute walk up the street (eat there -- you will not be disappointed); jogging through hyde park/kensington gardens is like central park -- enjoy tea at the orangery and walk around the adjoining garden. tube stops within a few blocks -- easy to get turned around in the s. kensington station with all the tunnels, but you will not mind walking around to orient yourself.downsides? (1) it is been discovered -- attracts fair amount of rif-raf scoping a deal who spoil the otherwise dignified feel; (2) not quite at the 4-star level -- sheets had small holes, blankets were a bit dated and wallpaper was beat up and peeling -- but the other improvements in the room (esp. the bathroom) made up for it; (3) breakfast crowds sometimes force waiting; (4) breakfast buffet very good, but avoid that greasy toast stuff and make your own. still, cannot beat the value, room size and location, so it gets a strong thumb's up! enjoy one of the greatest cities in the world!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,'''a comfortable stay. rooms are large with large walk-in wardrobe and toilet. luxurious marble lined toilet with espa toiletries. comfortable bed. nespresso machine in the room is a nice touch. location is convenient to most sites and shopping . trafalgar square just 1 minute walk away. breakfast in the hotel may be expensive but lots of choices just outside the hotel.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel exceeded our expectations in every way. the room size was larger than most we have experienced in the uk, linens and room were impeccably clean and the water pressure in the shower was amazing (and hot!). staff at the front desk was courteous and accommodating, especially when we arrived well before check in time. although the exact room we had booked was not quite ready for an early check in, the staff was able to provide us with an equivalent room. | the traditional english breakfast buffet that was included in the package provided so many robust options that most days we did not eat again until the very late afternoon. and unlike some 'breakfast rooms' encountered in other hotels, this one was large, well-lit and sunny, with plenty of tables spaced well apart. | the location is superb. tucked along a main street in knightsbridge, 2 blocks from the s kensington tube stop, across the street from several important museums and 3 blocks from harrods and the other famous knightbridge shops. the immediate area surrounding the tube stop had several interesting ethnic restaurants, pastry shops, and a cheese shop. but best of all, the tube stop is the line that connects directly to heathrow, making arrivals and departures much less expensive. | we would stay here again when we return to london. well done, mates!!'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we have stayed at rhodes house many times over the last decade since we moved out of london - i even stayed there the night before my wedding last year! for us now, with owners chris and maria's hospitality, it has become a home from home. we have watched as they have made continual improvements over the years and yet it remains amazing value for money in central london. we stayed a week ago for the first time in several months and were particularly impressed by the new hi-tech bathroom we had, with 3 way power shower and even a different switch for fluorescent blue lighting. just switching this on means that you have do not have a bright light, or set the bathroom fan going and wake up others in the room in the middle of the night. everything was convenient - even the bedside lamps had dimmer switches. the new mattresses were really high quality and incredibly comfortable. our room was small but everything fit perfectly and it was very clean, safe and secure. and in the morning was the usual generous breakfast. i highly recommend rhodes house hotel for convenience, value for money, location and hospitality.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''stayed in this fine hotel for a visit to the globe theatre. located on the south bank only minutes walk from both the national theatre and the globe it is very well positioned for visits to either theatre. | hotel was of a high standard and the staff were first class. | would recommend for a london visit that included theatre trips.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i booked the corinthia as a treat for my husband for valentines weekend. i wanted to prepay so my husband did not see the bill. aldo took control of this for me with ease (thank you) so i had every confidence of a special visit even before arriving. i was right. this hotel is simply stunning, operated by friendly and welcoming staff. it exudes style, confidence and beauty. we were upgraded to an executive king which was a lovely surprise - where a delicious chocolate cake and handwritten card was waiting for us. a nice gesture. | attention to detail is the best i have witnessed in the uk. highlights in the room were the mood lighting, the water pressure in the most fantastic shower and bath and turndown chocolates in their own individual boxes. | we visited both bars which were buzzy and fun. breakfast was a delight of hot and cold choices. | the whole ambience of the hotel was quite special and refined without being in any way pompous. everything just flowed and seemed effortless. the staff should be very proud of what they achieve. | yes, it is expensive but save up and stay at the corinthia at least once. you will not be disappointed. my visit was over a week ago and i am still in awe of the experience. i am saving for a return visit.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''had three nights here and had a great stay. upgraded to a large room with balcony which made the stay even better as used the balcony a lot due to very hot weather. all the staff were friendly and helpful. breakfast was excellent and tried something different each morning. | it is a little out the way but if was fine for us. | they left petals and chocs on bed as were were celebrating an anniversary and that was much appreciated. | will definitely stay here again''',2

The Savoy,"'''an excellent three course champagne lunch with friends. the savoy is quite stunning and the food was superb as expected. small niggles which are quite unforgivable were:- salt and pepper pots were empty and we had to ask for replacements, the tables, althought polished on the top, were dirty around the edge and dried on food did not enhance the experience. the mirrors (of which there were many) had not been cleaned very well, (restaurant manager take note) and the external windows were dirty, which detracted from the experience of watching the thames traffic while eating our meal. | the espresso after the meal would hardly fill a tablespoon, and only came half way up the miniscule cup. smallest espresso i have ever had, although excellent in taste. | toilets were very clean, and i am quite capable of turning on a tap myself and also capable of picking up a towel myself...these refinements are unneccessary.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''could not fault location, room and staff. stayed here for my boyfriend's 30th birthday and enjoyed a lovely meal at the seacontainers restaurant and thought the rumpus room was excellent. special thanks to amy for the card and bottle of wine in the room, was a great touch. would definitely recommend this hotel and cannot wait to come back.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we stayed at corinthia for a mini break and the hotel is perfection itself. everything from the check in to check out is performed with perfection. the staff are extremely helpful and cannot do enough for you. the room was everything you would expect and more at this price range, good size, great shower with both rainbow and hand held options, good tv options and even a tv in the bathroom. we had cocktails in the evening before going out to dinner and again the suggestions were spot on. to top it off we had breakfast in the bedroom which was, for want of a better word, perfect. we popped into the spa area for a bit too which really is an oasis of tranquility in central london. the hotel is well located, 2 mins walk from tube and thames clipper stops and 4 mins from a train station. we shopped, ate out in town and still came away completely relaxed and that does not often happen on a city break.'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed here for one night on business. it is a friendly hotel, good quality and clean rooms and very efficient staff. the hotel is opposite victoria and albert museum and only a short, pleasant walk to harrods. check in and out is also quick and efficient. breakfast is buffet style with ample choice. unfortunately, at the latter stage of breakfast, we had a false fire alarm (it happens). being fully dressed, it was therefore effortless (lol) and of little concern. for lunch, in the bar, i had a rather nice chicken caesar salad with an enjoyable glass of pinot grigio. however, i found this rather expensive and hence a little disappointed. nevertheless, i would not hesitate to both recommend and return. ease of access...south kensington tube ctation is only a five minute walk away.'''",2
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''this is decadent art deco bar with a great outside space to take advantage of if you wish. | the greet is always warm and the menu has one of the largest arrays of champagne i have ever seen. there is a minimum spend which from memory was about 70, but if you are getting a bottle of fizz you already have this covered. | great spot of you are looking to treat yourself or for a romantic cocktail.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''with my wife's birthday being only 6 days before christmas we try to do something in town so her birthday does not get swallowed-up in christmas. we managed to get a good rate for a night at the rembrandt hotel. as mentioned by many others, the location is great being opposite the v&amp;a museum and a short walk from harrods. | on arrival i was reminded that our deal included a 'sharing platter' and glass of prosecco (ideal as we were both hungry being close to the check-in time). the food was well-presented and tasty (try the asparagus tempura). | our room was spacious, clean and well-appointed (with an iron and ironing-board and clothes brush which we actually had the need to use). | after a night in the west end we returned to the hotel for a good night's sleep. the following morning we had breakfast which included everything you would expect and want. | in conclusion, a spacious clean room, comfortable bed, good location, friendly helpful staff and good breakfast, so i would therefore not hesitate to recommend the rembrandt.'''",2
London Guest House,"'''it was easy to find, the room was nice (had it for 1 night), warm and clean. the bathroom also clean with balanced hot/cold water. good towels. very good breakfast (cereals, cheese, eggs). only not-free wifi - had to pay 2/day and there were some problems with connection, although solved by staff. staff was helpful and it is nice that the guesthouse has someone around for 24h. | it was a bit far - 15 min from north acton station, no people in the eve or early morning, lots of construction on the way. but given the fact it is zone 2 - not very expensive to take tube to the center. however, would not stay for longer than 2 days - transportation for 2 + room price - possible to find something closer to center (maybe not that clean and warm :)) | also noted, but was not bothered - you can hear everyone around you - doors shutting, kids playing, couples ""giggling"". but it is guesthouse. | would recommend and come back for a night or two.'''",2

The Lanesborough,"'''a friend and i visited the lanesborough today for afternoon tea. i live n scotland and it has become a ritual that when i visit london, we have afternoon tea in a variety of well known hotels. this was my first visit to the lanesborough , which i understand has recently re-opened after refurbishment. from the minute we entered the lobby. the doorman was extremely pleasant and welcoming. this was to be our experience throughout our visit. christian, one of the waiting staff took time to chat to us over and above the call of duty. the pianist, came over and spoke to us. our whole experience was first class. the tea itself was superb, fresh and the pastries innovative. sandwiches, tea and champagne were refreshed discretely and there was no sense of being ""hurried"" which we have experienced in some other 5 star hotels. i thoroughly recommend the lanesnorough and wish it is new incarnation success. i will certainly be back. price wise it compares with the ritz, claridges and the dorchester without the rush or time slots sometimes found elsewhere. def 5star .'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''mandarin knightsbridge is a top class hotel. what really made it for us was the lovely staff. we checked in at 11.00 a.m. on saturday then went to lunch in piccadilly and out for the evening checking back in at about 8.30 p.m. to bar boulud for a superb evening. checked in for the night and then checked out at 11.00 a.m. sunday morning. so hardly there and most of the time asleep but the staff are brilliant, welcoming, friendly, interested in you, in a good way. | highly recommended'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we regularly stay at the rembrandt hotel and consider it a well run hotel with good bar food,excellent breakfasts and polite and efficient service. its location to some of london's best attractions is a major selling feature. the rooms are adequately sized and well appointed. they also have an outstanding maitre d by the name of najib who is an ever present constant in a hotel with inevitable staff turnover.will we be staying in the rembrandt in the next few years? probably not. the reason is the incremental change in the surrounding areas demographics that are making us feel less and less comfortable. this in no way is the fault of the rembrandt but is very much a factor for us when deciding where to stay.'''",2
The Rembrandt,'''so for me no flaws. | also experienced a smooth not intensional fire-drill for which we had to abandon our beds but it is comforting to see you can find your way out quick and easy which is from a safety perspective a big plus. | breakfast also with freshly baked eggs and everything there. rooms are big enough but the bed could be a kingsize but a large tv and good functioning aircon. | staff who are all from abroad are working really hard and are serviceoriented. | i have seen a lot of hotels in london and this is a very good hotel''',2

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed on business and black tie dinner in evening provided fantastic food. staff friendly and always said hello as you went past. room was spacious, clean and the turning-down service is a nice touch. bathroom was excellent with powerful shower and expensive glasses. the bar attached to the hotel also does excellent cocktails and the hotel is a short ride from mahiki. super choice at breakfast and they are also very accomodating if you have a massive hangover...'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''we stayed at the dorchester hotel for one night in late january as a new years treat. amazing does not begin to describe it. the dorchester exceeded all our expectations and is an absolute must for those in need of a little pampering. | the plush decor, spacious and luxurious rooms, a sublime dining experience in the grill restaurant as well as a delicious breakfast were just some of the highlights. | however the strength of this hotel lies in its staff. we were greeted on arrival by a polite, polished and incredibly professional front of house staff. the impeccable service and consideration we received from james (front of house) together with pierre and alan in the the promenade was a delight. in fact every member of staff did their utmost to ensure our stay was a memorable one. a special thank you to the laundry staff who not only pressed our outfits for the evening but successfully managed to remove a resistant stain that had survived 2 dry cleaning attempts elsewhere! | an unforgettable experience'''",2

The Dorchester,"'''stayed here recently to attend a wedding at the hotel, very inpressed with our overall experience. the hotel is full of the opulence and grandeur one would expect the foyer was breathtaking with the beautiful smell from the huge flower arrangements. our room was classic in design with huge queen bed and gorgeous marble stone bathroom. the decor is not my prefered contemporary style, more traditional but everything very chic and of the higest quality. the staff are extremely friendly &amp; helpful one even showering my 1 year old son with free gifts from the hotel. the wedding was wonderful, food delicious. breakfast in the promenade lovely and service indeed impeccable. yes it is expensive, however to stay on park lane in one of london's most prestigious and celebrated hotels and be treated like royalty should not and would not come cheap. for a truly british and luxurious treat stay here and cherish it forever.'''",2

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we visited the hotel xenia with friends for a 2 night stay from 30th december 2015 to 1st january 2016. my wife and i had stayed here before in the summer a couple of years ago and we hoped that our friend would like this hotel as much as we did. we were not surprised to find that actually said it was one of the best hotels they had stayed at in the capital. | we were greeted by the doorman who showed us to the reception desk where we were met by the most helpful and friendly receptionist who gave us every instruction we could possibly need and then the doorman showed us to the lifts and we found that our rooms were really nice, very modern and very clean and tidy. it has been said by a couple of reviewers that the rooms are small and it has to be said that they are not enormous by any standards but the size of the rooms are in line with some other hotels that we have stayed in in london and for the price we paid they are more than adequate. all of the amenities were top of the range, shower, tv, hair drier, tea/coffee making etc etc were all also easy to use. | the breakfast on both mornings was superb, with an enormous choice of hot and cold items and non stop tea and coffee and was all served up with a smile and a greeting by staff who are very efficient. | we had a drink in the bar on the first night and it is very well stocked and a very welcoming place to be in. | overall we have had one of our best visits to london and we come down at least once a year. | to sum up the xenia it is a top quality hotel with a staff who are obviously very proud of their workplace. we will certainly be back.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''mondrian was recently added as an option for my company's official work hotel - huge upgrade from our prior option. we were welcomed by very friendly staff. sush at the front desk checked us in and took care of making sure we had a great stay. we got a personal note from annabelle, the person who coordinates my company's account here. the food in the restaurant is excellent, the cocktails are creative and delicious. the fitness center is good for a hotel gym. rooms are small but well-appointed with lovely luxury bath amenities. there was one day i went to take a shower before work and all our toiletries had disappeared, so i had to call the front desk and wait there in my towel for someone to bring toiletries so i could shower and get to the office. but other than that minor hiccup, it was a great stay!'''",2

The Savoy,"'''we stayed at the savoy based on a high recommendation from my in-laws, and we were so happy we did! the savoy is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location, right near covenant garden. | our room was always very clean, and was very comfortable. because we booked with american express we qualified for a lovely upgrade- and received a room on a high floor with a nice sitting area, and beautiful, large bathroom. | service here is impeccable from start to finish- doormen are very nice, the front desk was exceedingly accommodating and helpful- hurrying up a room for us much earlier in the day even than our american express card service grants us! we ate at breakfast at the hotel every morning and service here was prompt, helpful, and very friendly. concierge was incredibly helpful in helping to plan a day trip for us and a dinner as well. i grabbed coffee at the savoy tea twice, just because it was convenient and it was actually quite good, if over-priced. | last but not least i cannot recommend the american bar enough. drinks are superb, there is always live music, it is quiet and comfortable and just perfect.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''as with many hotels located in major cities the rooms here are small. | i booked a twin which is larger than a standard double in floor space but even so things were tight with no room to lay even a small cabin bag. ordinarily i would leave my bag in the wardrobe but this is not possible when the hangers are placed facing forward, the hotel are clearly aware of this as they tell you your empty luggage can be stored with the concierge. | fortunately our room was located a couple of floors up on the side of the building although this meant we had no view it also meant we were sheltered from the road noise other reviewers refer to. | you do not come to london to spend time sitting in your hotel room so neither the size nor the lack of view worried us. | the hotel is located within a couple of minutes walk of the underground (earls court one way gloucester road the other) and 10-15 minutes from the museums in kensington. there are a few eateries located within walking distance if you do not want to head to other parts of the city, we did not try these personally, there is also a sainsbury's right next door. | whilst this is by no means my favourite hotel in the city it is by far from the worst and i would book to stay here again given the reasonable pricing. | the staff were all incredibly friendly yet professional and are a credit to the hotel.'''",2
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''originally was put off at the price of this hotel. however the service from all the staff was exceptional. the concierge managed to get us into the restaurant of our choice the berners tavern, with no notice (we had failed). the pictures on the web site do not do the rooms justice which are superb. | above all the service is wonderful they have thought of pretty everything. it is a shame they do not sell the room fridges, but then again we did not ask. | it is expensive but then again it says bulgari over the door so the clues are there. best toiletries ever.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we stayed at both the mandarin and claridge's on the same trip, and i found both experiences to be wonderful. the staff at the mandarin is top-knotch, making us feel very welcome immediately upon check-in. we wanted to check-in very early due to our jetlag, and they accomodated us right away. our room was beautiful and extremely comfortable with a nice foyer, large bedroom and lovely marble bathroom. the bed was very comfortable, and the compartmentalized closet made it easy for us to keep all of our clothing organized. the location cannot be beat for tourist activities - great shopping across the street with harvey nichols and harrod's, as well as sloane st., and walking distance to buckingham palace and of course hyde park. continental breakfast was included in our rate, and was a pleasure to wake up to each morning - the room service staff was so friendly and thoughtful. the room was expensive, but london is an expensive city. there is also construction going on next door, which did not disturb us, but made crossing the street an exciting challenge.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''very nice hotel in a convenient location near multiple train and tube stops. rooms were very clean and size of the room was fantastic considering size of most london hotels. breakfast was very nice and reasonably priced for a hotel breakfast and they breakfast staff were great.the only negative i have is that upon check in the room was not available yet even though it was already past check in time. instead of just giving the next size up we had to instead wait 30 minutes for it to be cleaned. it was very slow on the weekend so i am not sure why that was decided.''',2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''while i did not stay at the xenia during my recent trip to london (i stayed around the corner,) i always found myself stopping in at the restaurant and or bar on my way home from a long day out with the sites. the lovely staff, namely freddy and nicola, were always welcoming and friendly. as a female traveling alone, this place was a blessing. delicious and very reasonably priced food, great selection of wine and friendly banter in a very cozy bar. thank you, hotel xenia, for making me feel at home.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''looking at other reviews on trip advisor (as we always do before staying anywhere), i cannot understand how the savoy could receive anything other than a five-star rating. i have stayed at many fairmont hotels but nothing comes close to the class of the savoy. | history: | to begin with the hotel itself, it is built on the footing of the old savoy palace from 1246. the hotel was rebuilt in the late 1800's and was the finest of its time. it was the first hotel in london to feature electricity and elevators (the original elevators, known at the time as ""ascending rooms"" are still in service). of course the hotel became a celebrity hotspot. if you stay at the savoy, you will be walking through the same doors as marilyn monroe, winston churchill, and the queen herself. in fact, princess diana was a regular at the hotel's american bar - so much so that the head bartender made a special drink just for her named the blushing monarch. to this day, the hotel remains a hit with celebrities. while dining at chef gordon ramsey's restaurant, the savoy grill, we sat across from stephen tyler from aerosmith. who knows who you will run into while staying at the savoy! | location: | you are a 10-minute walk to most of london's tourist hotspots. walk a few minutes down the road and you will be at trafalgar square. keep walking and you will be on the mall along st. james park. a few minutes later, you will find yourself at buckingham palace. turn left at trafalgar square instead and you will be a 5 minute walk away from the parliament building, big ben, and westminster abbey. just beyond the bridge is the london eye and the aquarium. | rooms: | the rooms are very beautiful and decently sized for a heritage hotel (the hotel is well over 100-years old - do not expect a massive room). the bathrooms on the other hand are surprisingly large, marble throughout, and absolutely beautiful as well as functional. the shower has a rain shower head and the deep tub features a beautiful antique-style fixture. many rooms have a view of the courtyard however which is not particularly beautiful. if having a room with a lovely view is something important to you, you may want to specify in advance you would like a view of the thames river, lest you be disappointed. | dining: | the hotel has a few dining options including kaspar's (in art deco style) where the food was delicious and came out of the kitchen quickly. at the american bar, do not accidentally order a $5,000 glass of cognac or a $750 glass of the world's rarest rum - both of which you can find beautifully displayed in the hotel museum. other than a fee exceptions, drinks here are reasonably priced and the atmosphere is lovely with a piano player in the centre of the bar. | service: | last but certainly not least of importance is the service. the staff here are incredible. as a fairmont visitor in canada, you will most definitely notice a quality improvement in service when at the savoy in london. just two quick examples, should the hotel be reading this - first, i forgot to return a borrow jacket to my tour guide who had just dropped me off at the hotel and thus had driven away. gentsy (spelling is wrong, i am sure) who is one of the doormen, took off his top hat and went running down the street likely three blocks at a sprint before he caught up with the car! another example: each morning at 4:30am i went for a jog. on the first morning when i returned, i asked the overnight concierge for a bottle of water. the second morning when i returned he already had a cold bottle waiting for me. two stories of how thoughtful the staff are.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''booked through booking.com. stayed for one night on a saturday for my boyfriends birthday. arrived too early to check in, however staff were very helpful and minded our luggage until we arrived back in the afternoon to go to our room. as we arrived back, lady at reception greeted immediatley, remebering our names and advised we had been upgraded to a suite and our luggage had already been placed in the room. room was amazing, no other words to explain! gorgeous boutique decor along with a balcony and floor to ceiling windows. plus a birthday card and chocs were left as a gift for my boyfriend. i have never slept in a bed so comfortable and it was massive. my only regret is we never booked for longer. cannot believe how cheap this room was for what we got. elemis tolieteries were a lovely touch (even included lavender spray for pillow at night). very close to tube station, literally 3 - 4 minute walk from moorgate. cannot wait to return! thank you apex!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we took advantage of an a good deal to stay at this hotel. so i am basing my review on not having paid really high prices. this hotel has a cool vibe,,,dark public spaces, interesting use of mirrors and lighting and fantastic views of the thames. our room was fun with out of the ordinary touches....takes the mini bar to a whole new level. the best reason for staying there is the roof top bar. lively, cool and fantastic views. conveniently situated at blackfriars means that you can easily explore south and north of the river. we walked to bermondsey and borough market and islington all in one morning. i love big noisy hotels and if you do too then you will love the mondrian...oh and breakfast was great too'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''i had the pleasure to stay here on the 28th november for a black tie dinner with work. | the welcome was amazing and our room was ready at 11am which was a lovely surprise as we could settle in before doing a little black friday shopping. | however as we went to leave the room, the door handle came of in my hand and we were stuck! | a quick call and two lovely gents came to our rescue and we were on our way. | we also had afternoon tea which was amazingly lovely and i hope to go back again to have afternoon tea soon. | the black tie event was super and again the team were very attentive and nothing was to much trouble. | we took breakfast in the grill and to say it was disappointing is an understatement. the highlights...late food, uncooked, no milk, no toast and on and on. | however i mentioned this on check out and within a couple of hours the manger was on the phone to apologise and to ask me to contact him next time we go to the dorchester. they also did not charge for the breakfast before we checked out due to my complaint. | we would return again and it is a hotel that does not matter how rich you are or how you look, it just makes you feel welcome and very special even if a few hiccups happen as they normally do in life! | but they still made our stay fantastic, hope to be back soon.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''this was our first visit to the savoy, and we chose their sunday at the savoy package comprising the accommodation (which was lovely), dinner (3 courses from the select menu - very very tasty), and ample english breakfast. beverages, as you might expect, were things we chose according to our needs/desires of the moment and paid extra for. there was always the option to deviate from the package particulars at extra cost whenever we felt like it. the quality and attitude from every member of staff was not only excellent, but actually, for me, enchanting. | i thoroughly enjoyed our stay and have absolutely no hesitation in recommending the hotel, and the package. it is very much my wish to go again one day, and for longer !'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we visit london once a year in september for a week to have our car, which lives in france, serviced and to do some shopping. i must admit we are old 'family' at the ritz and due to the revamp currently being done there, our regular suite was unavailable; hence us booking into the savoy. we last stayed here somewhere before 2010, i do not remember the exact dates but it certainly even looked different then. you would be forgiven to think you have walked into a hotel on red square as all the staff seem to be russian...! i can go on and keep you occupied for a long time but suffice it to say we were slightly disappointed by the lack of attention to detail. for example, housekeeping places fruit in your room and the cleaning staff take away the plates and cutlery. the next day you have plates and cutlery again but the fruit was removed...very confusing. the curtain in our room also had two big holes looking like cigarette burns in it. not what one would expect in a 5 star establishment at all. unfortunately for the savoy, we spend a lot of time at the ritz on place vendome in paris and have been spoilt by true five star service. not only do all staff at the ritz remember your name but even your suite or room number, unlike the lady at the savoy breakfast room who remembered my name but never my room number; the fifth morning it was just irritating that i had to remind her once more what the room number is. we did notice that the fairmont group is now in charge at the savoy and that might explain why the old savoy's opulence is gone, together with the stiff upper lip service perfection from english staff we came to expect and adore. to put it in a nutshell, we encountered a chamber maid in our room and requested they return the second gown which was taken away. she fled after a flurry of russian i had no hope to comprehend after which a room service waiter brought two bottles of water....we just left it at that. not too keen to return to the savoy...'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the mondrian is a top notch location, has truly world class bars &amp; is in no way stuffy in its approach to service. we were in town for the theatre but enjoyed the hotel just as much- from the inventive &amp; well executed cocktails at dandilyan to the trendy late night rumpus room on the 12th floor the drinks offer is amazing.. cleverly followed through to the mini bar. breakfast in the airy riverside restaurant was fantastic too (worth getting down a little earlier than the main crowd- we ate in a relaxed environment at 9.. but the place was packed and a little hectic by 10) of there was one short fall, the check in was not particularly informative- we explored and found out what was on offer.. but easily could have missed the best bits..'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''my wife and i had high hopes for this hotel based on the reviews here and were more than satisfied. our room, although at the top floor was spacious and comfortable. the staff was very friendly and very much like family by the end of the trip. its hard to know what to say that has not been said. even without a room with a bathroom in it, it was still private and convenient to use the shared facilities. the breakfast was simply amazing, one of the highlights of our entire european trip. have recommended this already and will continue to until we stay there again! this was the best part of london for us.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we had 2 nights here the hotel is easy to find and a simple 10 minutes from euston. there are good shops and cafes round about and it is close to the underground. the british museum is just around the corner. breakfast was served by friendly staff, a standard cooked breakfast with orange juice cereal and toast and good coffee. the bedroom was in the basement at the back of the hotel so no view but very quiet. | our room was basic but spotless and the ensuite shower room looked brand new.'''",2

The Dorchester,"'''my wife booked us in to the dorchester for my birthday and it is an amazing, wonderful comfortable place, with a true attention to detail. i think we had an executive suite with park views, the room was stunning and elegant and tastefully decorated. we had an entrance hall a four poster bed a balcony, a dressing room and a marble clad bathroom with one of the biggest baths i have ever seen. the highest level of quality runs through the hotel from the lobby, to the champagne bar, lifts, corridors and room. the staff are very attentive and i would highly recommend a stay here.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we return to london every year at christmas to do our shopping (there is no where like fortnum and mason for the festive spirit) and for our friends christmas party. having stayed previously at the mondrian's sister properties we thought we would check out this relatively new establishment to make a change, we were not disappointed. | the service was impeccable from the doormen, to the receptionists, the bar staff (in both the rumpus room and the dandelyan) were very knowledgable and everyone was just generally relaxed and friendly, which is what you want when you are getting away - i cannot stand the formalities of some of the older establishments. | the bedroom was brilliant, i loved the nautical theme throughout the hotel and followed through into the bedrooms, but not overdone and not kitsch, really spot on. the beds were super comfortable, the bathrooms spacious with great showers and amenities. | the highlight of the bedroom and i would say actually most public spaces was the view. i believe that the mondrian is one of the few five star hotels that is south of the river (apart from the shard of course) and therefore has a commanding view of the old city of london, st pauls, houses of parliament, etc etc...from the bedroom, rumpus room, even on the ground floor the view across the river was so tranquil and we spent many hours in the dandelyan bar just watching people walk by. | breakfast was another highlight (although service was a little disjointed - a small confusion that was quickly sorted out) the buffet was fabulous offering the classics but the a la carte menu was fab and i would recommend just popping in for the sammy which was to die for ""the egg sammy | sunny side up egg, crispy bacon, jack cheese, avocado, coriander &amp; chipotle relish on a brioche bun"" - so good!!! | all in all a great stay and i really hope we have an excuse to pop back to london in the not too distant future so we can stay again, i can only imagine how fab it will be in the summer when the southbank is at its most vibrant!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i fi would have to describe the hotel , i would say luxury at is finest ... first of all location is great ! amazing raception hall. a nice terrace is on the ground floor. here below the positive and negatives points i would have : | positive: | - great location | - amazing decor and buidling | - very clean- | - staff is exceptionnal from reception, to restaurants , to conciergrie to cleaners. perfect | - great breakfast | - rooms spacious and very clean and cosy | negative | - the room ventilation might be a bit noisy | - price of the restaurant but again you are in a 5* hotel so logical'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed for the first time after recommendations from friends and family and can safely say i was not disappointed. on arrival the staff at the check in desk were beyond helpful and explained everything i needed to know to enjoy my stay and made it clear if i had any problems they would happily fix them! the rooms were fantastic and cleaned perfectly, but the highlight was definitely breakfast and dinner. the food at breakfast was varied and delicious and dinner was at a great standard! a special thanks to johnny who served me at breakfast both mornings and dinner one night of my stay, a lovely staff member who was amazing to chat with and genuinely cared about what i had to say, my girlfriend felt the same and came to the table with a huge smile on her face after having a chat with him at breakfast. a brilliant and friendly staff member who really made the stay feel special, i would recommend to anyone who plans on staying!'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''the hotel was recommended by a friend. all staff friendly. rooms immaculate, if small. lst day of heatwave fans appeared. daily breakfasts substantial and of good quality. during 3 week stay bathroom always clean, rooms serviced without intrusion. questions as to travel plans answered very completely with maps often provided for busses. given two sets of directions in one case (on separate sides of paper) to allow me to choose best seeming one. when i visited a place the owner did not know about he asked detailed questions to help other guests. i will willingly go back.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''upon arrival we were told that we have been upgraded to a lager room with balcony. the room was well decorated and we even received a small surprise. my personal favouriate is the bathroom, very spacious and the bath tub is the best i have ever seen. we will surely come back again!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i definitely recommend a stay at the new mondrian in london. it is very well located in the city. it is proximity to the path along the river makes it easy to get just about anywhere in central london. the staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable. the lobby has a relaxed, cool vibe - perfect for relaxing, having a drink and watching people walk by along the riverfront. the rooms are big and comfortable and come with quality amenities.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''it is hard to fault the corinthia, so perhaps this comes down to personal taste. whilst the building is impressive, i found it a bit cold (in atmosphere). i found the food and service at the restaurant (massimo) lacking, especially considering this is a five star hotel. the location however is excellent. my husband and i woke early to wander down to the thames to watch the sunrise--it is only a stone's throw from the hotel. the room itself was wonderful--airy and light yet cosy and welcoming. room service was excellent. nothing like climbing into your fluffy robe and settling in for some hot tea and mushy peas. i would not however, be compelled to return. the search continues for my favorite london hotel.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,'''stayed twice here for 3 weeks total and the place is fabulous. the rooms are nicely appointed and comfortable. modern bathrooms. staff is exceptionable! centrally located. recommend highly....you will not be disappointed''',2
The Savoy,"'''i cannot praise the staff and especially the concierge at this fantastic hotel. their help was exemplary and well beyond anything that i could have hoped for. after leaving a recently purchased present in a taxi when arriving at the hotel i had resigned myself to never seeing it again. not only did the staff find out the reg number of the taxi via their security cameras but they then somehow managed to locate said taxi and have the present returned before i left to get my flight. thanks should also go to the driver but i do not know their details. | thank you for breaking this nightmare journey with a quite, amazingly comfortable experience.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''the hotel is very well located with stylish modern decor. peter on the front desk was great and made us feel very welcome. the level of service we received overall was excellent. my only disappointment was the city view was actually a view of a staircase! this may be more to do with expedia's description than the hotel's' as it was not booked directly. next time i would go for a river view.''',2
The Savoy,"'''this hotel is the pinnacle of excellent service. friendly and helpful staff, gorgeous grounds and interior dcor, centrally located in london with easy access to all modes of transportation. i will never stay anywhere else in london.'''",2
The Savoy,'''was not a resident of the hotel but following going to a show at the savoy theatre we decided to have a late night drink in the american bar. the service and the staff were first class and the bottle of pinot grigio well chilled. lovely ambience and the piano player/singer unobtrusive.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed one night at the rembrandt as i was attending a reception at the natural history museum and wanted somewhere close by. overall i was very happy with my choice. the room i had was a 'superior double' on the fourth floor at the back of the hotel. it was quiet with pleasant views and, although rather small, was comfortable and clean. both the room and the bathroom looked as though they had been updated recently. the hotel provides free wifi (so glad hotels are, at last, realising that guests do not want to pay extra for this) and a good buffet breakfast. staff were also friendly an defficient. location is excellent for access to the museums and knightsbridge and the underground station is just a few minutes walk. will look to staying here again for events in london.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was clean. just round the corner from paddington tube and mainline. the ladies serving breakfast were very friendly and efficient. obviously it is more of a home from home place, do not expect anything fancy, but who really needs a choice of four different juices and cereals. they had nutella, peanut butter, marmite and vegemite as well as jam. there is not a pool or fitness centre, obviously, i could not cancel the ratings below.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''could not fault any part of my stay, nice central location too, staff were very accommodating &amp; friendly, had a nice relaxing evening &amp; just what i needed, i did not take much advantage of hotel facilities as had to meet up with colleagues elsewhere'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i just returned from a three night stay at this hotel over the christmas holiday. this hotel knows how to do it right. beautiful traditional style with great rooms. i do not know what type of mattress and linens they use but i never slept so well in a hotel before, and i have stayed in some pretty nice ones. friendly and accommodating staff with a great location - across from harvey nicks and up the block from harrods. there were some other nice looking hotels in the area, including the lanesborough and dorchester if you really want to she will out some dough. although somewhat pricey, the mandarin was well worth every penny!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''i have not come back to the savoy since the renovation. it was good to be back, what i like at the savoy : location, near covent garden, picadilly and so many other find place. the style, the class. art deco with comfort. rooms are nicer and i was in room 549 just in front of the main entrance, what a lovely view. then i like the breakfast (make sure you have it properly in the restaurant not in the lobby bar). the service and the genuine friendly attitude of the staff. what is not acceptable in this hotel as that they charge you 10 a day for wifi internet. unbelievable.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''stayed at this hotel in july with my teenage son. it is a great location and feels very safe at night. we did not feel at all ill at ease walking home late at night which was a huge plus. there is a bus stop virtually across the road, euston station is within 5 mins walking distance, 2-3 minutes walk round the corner is googe st subway. the older gentleman (not sure if he is the owner) at breakfast asked where we were going for the day and would tell us which number of bus, etc to get there - brilliant help. breakfast was very nice but a bit repetitive, cereal, bacon and eggs every morning. would have been nice to have a bit more choice but service was excellent and staff helpful and friendly. the bedrooms are pretty old fashioned and basic but very, very clean. it is been years since i have had blankets on the bed!! free coffee and tea machine in guest lounge and cold can machine at 50p per can pretty good. two modern computers also in lounge and free wifi throughout the hotel which was great. we had a room at the front which was pretty noisy so we could not have the window open at night but there was a fan in the room which was a life saver in the heat! all in all a great wee hotel - cannot help but feel though that it could look so much better and rooms more welcoming with a bit of more up to date dcor and duvets on the beds.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this hotel is right on the south bank so is in a perfect location for getting anywhere in london. the staff were friendly, the room was great, with a well stocked mini bar and lovely toiletries in the bathroom. the food was delicious but was slow to arrive via room service (1 hr 40). the complimentary wifi could have been better too, and i was woken up one night by noisy revellers - but all in all it was an enjoyable stay.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''had the opportunity to stay here for few nights whilst on business, the hotel and its facilities were very good, we were in a grand room and pleasantly impressed with the quality of the furnishings and the cleanliness, great position for seeing london. the breakfast buffet was plentiful although the cooked breakfast was obviously cooked earlier and kept warm resulting in either cold or dried out food, not reflecting the quality of the facilities of the hotel'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''nice budget-hotel located close to paddington station and lancaster gate with the central line. service is personal and very good. rooms are small but nice and clean. the street, sussex sq., is not so busy.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we stayed just one night--needing a hotel in walking distance to the liverpool street station as we had an early flight to greece from stanstead airport and needed to catch the train from liverpool street out to the airport. i have been to london several times and like to try different neighborhoods. i was pleasantly surprised by our stay in the financial district--we plotted a pleasant walk over tower bridge and along the footpath to the tate modern. we also enjoyed an easy walk to brick lane for indian and popped into a few pubs along the way to enjoy friday-night happy hour with the locals. the hotel is situated on a quiet street and honestly, we had one of the best sleeps--i did not hear a single thing--not another guest returning or street noise. the room was sleek and had all the amenities you need (lovely teas and biscuits included!). the bar looked really nice, too, but we did not try it out. i would definitely recommend this hotel/location for both business and pleasure.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''brilliant band created relaxing vibes while we ate our brunch with the bottomless prosecco, mimosa or bloody mary deal. our waiter manuel could not have been more attentive. he really made the afternoon flow smoothly, along with his colleague fillipe. really wish i would had some cash in my purse to add an extra tip on top of the service included.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''having stayed in the mandarin in milan 1 week before the shock was great. | while the dining room, bar and boulud were in line with the expected standard of the group. so is the staff, providing top notch service with a smile and good will. but the rooms clearly have been waiting for years for a facelift! urgent need of attention as my room was more like a 3 star with broken fittings, and style that was possibly in vogue last century?'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''amazing service, thoughtful and accommodating. very client orientated and nothing is too much. personal attention, which is so sincere that one feels part of ' the family"". | the restaurant is superb. food is divine and here the service is, once again, the trademark of the establishment. i will not hesitate to recommended and i will return often. location, again, is something i find necessary and it does not disappoint.'''",2
The Savoy,'''warm unassuming service by all members of staff made this a weekend to remember. dean our concierge was courteous and his recommendations surpassed our expectations. it is the quality and caring customer service offered by the staff of the savoy that make it feel like home no matter how long or short your stay is. | the location of the savoy is unbeatable if you wish to be in the heart of theatreland or enjoy the ambiance of covent garden. the london eye and the south bank are also within walking distance of the hotel.''',2
The Savoy,"'''this time we spent just one night, we did not book a suite this time, just an average room. had a thoroughly good time. afternoon tea was excellent, the american bar is just always a must and we had a beautiful breakfast. service was very good. it is great returning to a hotel and feeling it was as good as before.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''the three nights we spent at the savoy were memorable. its beauty and welcoming, efficient staff made us feel special even as members of a tour group. our room was spacious and beautifully decorated. i loved the bathroom, especially the tub! the public areas are gorgeous and had beautiful flower arrangements. the halls are even the prettiest hotel halls i have seen, and we discovered during our evening wanderings the room where maria callas had stayed with her name embossed on the room number plaque. we learned that there are other rooms marked in this way, as well as having a framed photograph of a celebrity on the nightstand. breakfast each morning was served as if it were a special event, and the wait staff did an excellent job at remembering us. our only dinner on site was a group event in a very special room - the pinafore room where churchill and friends had supper club meetings. one look at the cars in the you-shaped entrance drive and the valet staff was enough to indicate that we were in a top-notch location.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''really enjoyed stay. amazing views and friendly staff. meal in sea containers restaurant before 7 (set menu) good value. cool vibe in both cocktail and rooftop bars. highly recommend. would stay again and take partner next time. breakfast excellent and steam room and gym quiet and well equipped.''',2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''stayed for just one night while in london on business. was placed in the annex round the corner, but was walked round there by one of the staff. room on the top floor was not huge, but as a double for one person it was fine. the room was clean and modern. bathroom was fine, with a good shower. the only downside was the room being on the top floor up a steep staircase - this would because problems for someone with mobility issues. cannot comment on breakfast as i met a colleague elsewhere.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''arrived for birthday celebrations and the staff were very attentive even, made the occasion feel really special. the food was amazing, we had the afternoon tea and did not eat a thing for the rest of the evening, we were full and content. it is true you get what you pay for. will definitely be returning for another special treat.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''classic but lots of class ! and i am usually more attracted by modern style, but i love the warmth of the mandarin in london ! | great location, excellent service, even if i go 2 or 3 times a year they remember my name. | nice room, great bed, nice flat screens, perfect staff, great spa, wonderfull breakfast... i could go on and on ! | cannot find anything negative, oh yes , one thing ! we do not like the wooden heavy tray they keep putting on the bed every night with the tv remote control and a flower...!! you never know what to do with the tray when you get in bed and you just need the b&amp;o remote !!'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed in this hotel late april 2015, with a friend, the visit to london included football (arsenal v chelsea), great food, and super accommodation here, room was excellent, room service great, as well as the service at the reception, breakfast, drinks at the lobby bar, and a good location, nearest tube just 5 mins walk...a great choice of accommodation in london, not the cheapest one, but worth the money!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''where do i start about this wonderful amazing magical remarkable hotel ? we stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday and our recent wedding. | upon arrival at this magnificent hotel our car was taken by the front staff who went and parked it for us. | check in was a breeze and we was taken to a small room away from the main lobby area to check in and was greeted as though we had been to the savoy a thousand times - for note, this was our first time. | we was then given a small tour of the hotel and was taken in the red lift to our room on the 5th floor. we was in room 521 which was just a few doors down from the royal suite ! the room was decorated in an edwardian style and it just took my breath away. the curvature of the room, the huge bed, the gorgeous marble bathroom - everything was just perfect. once we had settled in and changed we went down to the thames foyer for afternoon tea. | again upon arrival at the thames foyer we was greeted like old friends to the hotel and shown our table where afternoon tea would be served. we chose the rose champagne afternoon tea and was offered a selection of sandwiches of which there was a good choice of vegetarian ones - which can sometimes be a bit of an issue at other hotels - at the savoy - nothing is too much trouble. our waiter for the day was just wonderful and we held some fantastic conversations with him about his home town in italy and his travels all over the world before coming to work in the most wonderful hotel in the world - the savoy. we was even given a complimentary top up on our champagne and i was delighted to receive a rendition of happy birthday from the resident pianist and a birthday cake with a little candle in it. the attention to detail throughout is just stunning. | we then returned to our room and was provided with some room service cakes (as we could not finish them all at afternoon tea) and there was also some chocolate covered strawberries in the room as well as another small birthday cake - such a treat ! we went to see the show the dirty rotten scoundrels in the savoy theatre in the evening and had wonderful seats booked through the concierge. | after the show - which was hilariously funny - we went to the american bar were again we were greeted like regular guests. the vocalist and pianist was great and the cocktails were just superb. we was again rewarded with a complimentary cocktail to celebrate our wedding and my birthday. | our sleep was so peaceful and the bed was just like a cloud - dreamy. in the morning we had in room breakfast dining - utterly amazing. the food is just incredible and the service - well there are no words to describe the service, just fantastic. | after a shopping trip around london we returned to dine in kaspars restaurant in the evening which had a vegan menu - such a treat in a major hotel as we are often overlooked ! the food and service again were impeccable and could not be faulted in any way whatsoever. we was then escorted to the beaumont bar which feels incredibly exclusive as they was turning people away. i cannot remember the name of my cocktail i only know it was yummy, and my husband had old blue eyes which was prepared and finished at the table - obviously making it truly memorable. the only thing i would say is that the choice of entertainment in the beaumont bar that evening was a little out of character for the hotel as i found it cheesy and the vocalist was not very good - the pianist however was superb. that is my one and only criticism of the whole savoy experience. | after another peaceful nights sleep, we again had in room breakfast dining, again delicious and served by another wonderful friendly and professional member of staff. | we was both so sad to check out of the hotel, but we had an amazing memorable experience here which will stay with us for the rest of our lives. that is what you get at the savoy, it is not just another hotel stay, its a magical experience - one that we did not want to end. | the attention to detail, the staff, the food, the drinks, the afternoon tea, the room, the bathroom, the toiletries, the television, the in room dining, the mini bar, the turn down service, i cannot list everything but it was just all so incredible. thank you savoy for making my birthday a truly memorable one, and for a wonderful stay as husband and wife - we had only been married a few weeks when staying here. i could gush on about this experience forever - and will - to everyone ! thank you.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''this is our go to hotel each time we come to london for business or pleasure, and it does not disappoint. the staff is exceptionally trained, polite but not hovering or overwhelming. it is comforting after long travels to arrive at such a pleasant hotel with pleasant staff. this hotel is managed so well and the staff go above and beyond to accommodate its guests. the hotel itself is a lovely grand dame of a hotel. it embraces its deco-era heritage without being outdated or old fashioned. it feels fresh! the rooms are clean &amp; comfortable and serviced at least twice a day. we will keep coming back:) if you are in the mood for seafood, scott's in mayfair is fab!!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''we always have a weekend at the dorchester in january to get over the christmas blues. | once again the dorchester did not disappoint. | the reception staff were very friendly and we were able to check in early and get in the room. the room as always was stunning, the bathroom is about the size of most hotel rooms. | the bath (wow) ,easily fits 2 and you can fill it so deep its heaven on earth !!!. | everything you would expect from a 5*, linen, decor, top quality tv, | we had breakfast sent up to the room, full english cooked to perfection, big plate of pastries, fresh orange juice etc etc all presented on a table wheeled in to the room with fresh flowers (quality) | they even gave us a late check out (no charge) | if you go out of season this hotel is great value for money 240 per night with breakfast, for the quality of room and the service you get it is great value. | cannot wait to go back !!!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we had such a great experience at this hotel. we were celebrating our anniversary and the hotel found out due to some extras we had pre-ordered and they added a few extra touches to make us feel very special indeed. | the hotel itself is kitted out very nicely. the room was modern, spacious, clean and extremely comfortable. everything has been thought about. the bathroom was amazing! lovely balcony to enjoy the morning / afternoon sunshine | free wi-fi is not something you get everywhere and was a great additional service. | breakfast was great - we opted for room service. this was on time and efficient and the food was still hot. | location wise, it was perfect. extremely close to london bridge and st. pauls and within walking distance of all the main attractions (museums, galleries, london eye etc.). we did not use the tube once in the whole weekend. | all in all, a little gem of a hotel. would not hesitate to recommend it to others.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''beautiful river views. worlds best bar 2017. | small but nice rooms. great views. | not much in immediate area for food and drink. concierge needs a little help with comm skills. she was confused about oyster card and was not helpful in that regard. was told my night desk person to go to a restaurant that required a cab but did not realize my daughter could not enter due to age. things happen. if you get a good deal on rates its worth it just for the coolness factor and views of the thames.''',2
The Rembrandt,'''we picked this hotel because of it is position and reviews and was very pleased with it. the hotel is oppersite the v&amp;a museum and just down the road from the natural history museum. also harrods is only a short walk away and so too is south kensington tube station. | the hotel is very nice and so too is the buffet style breakfast. we had a club room which was a good size with a huge bed and single sofa bed for my 6 year old. | overall our stay was very pleasant and we will probably return.''',2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''a short walk across the bridge from blackfriars train and subway station, its location is fantastic especially if you are taking a train from gatwick airport. the hotel is modern and feels very upscale. the staff are very friendly and helpful. | it is also a walking distance to st. paul's cathedral and a little further to the tower of london. | the beds are comfortable and the rooms are a reasonable size. the wifi works well and is included. | there is a nice but pricey restaurant with great views of the river if you can get a table by the window or outside on the patio. the bar/lounge was very popular and crowded so we did not go but it had a good vibe. | when we were booking we noticed the price for the same room varies by 2-3x depending on the dates. if you can get it at the lower end it is great value for london.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''this is good hotel, fitted and equipped with most modern facilities. i stayed there for one night on a business trip but liked the overall experience. it has good gymnasium and restaurant (though there are not too many options but staff is courteous and helpful). hotel scores high on cleanliness and maintenance. probably, it is a newly constructed hotel or they just renovated when i stayed there. breakfast spread was good as well. overall, i felt it was a bit expensive for a business hotel.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the staff here are very friendly and make you feel welcome from the moment you walk in the front door. the christmas decorations were beautiful and the hotel was buzzing with holiday parties. at the moment the restaurant is being renovated and will not be open for a few months. the room i had was a bit dated although the television was new. the hotel does charge for wireless, which i always find to be annoying in a five star hotel. good choice in central london.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''as a frequent visitor of the mondrian in la, i was keen to experience how the latest morgan's hotel in london would compare. an extremely quick walk from blackfriars led me to a warm and friendly welcome from the hotel's door staff. as anticipated, the reception area is full of the quirky design features associated with morgans whilst retaining a sense of warmth and comfort. following a quick and smooth checkin, we were soon in our room which was bright and offered a spot of tranquility despite the south bank being only below. | i was lucky enough to enjoy the hotel's two bars during our stay. dandelyon's cocktail menu was the most original i have seen for a while and the views from the rumpus roon were spectacular!! | throughout my stay, i found all the hotel staff to be extremely friendly and with an energetic vibe to deliver a high standard of service. despite it being a busy weekend at the hotel, i found all the public areas to be immaculate. | a fantastic addition to the morgan's portfolio!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''i stayed for one night on a business trip to london. savoy is just what it promises to be - excellent. | i arrived post 9 pm and the check-in was swift. the rooms are very comfortable and well maintained. a very comfortable bed to sleep on. not very large room but just about fine. the bathroom had a fun and a shower area and with all amenities. the hotel has 2 bars and both are lively with live music and buzzing. only downside was that they did not have any beer on tap! | the location is excellent right in the centre of the city and walking distance to all touristy sights. | all in all, the best that money can buy for london.'''",2
London Guest House,"'''we booked in on sunday about 12h30. naveesh was at the desk and he was very kind, friendly, helpful and polite. we were greeted with a smile and a hearty welcome. we were told the way to the station as well as the main road if we need to go out. the room was very clean, (even the windows) and well organized. no shelves in the bathroom but everything else were just right. curtains was dark enough to not let in any light of the street. willing to add 2 extra pillows when i asked for it. breakfast (continental) was very good and fresh fruit was available. we were even helped to order in on our last night and offered cutlery and plates. definitely the place to be if you want to visit london and not be in the city. walking distance from the underground station and right next to a bus stop. we will absolutely refer friends and family to london guest house and use it again. fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!'''",2

"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''having just had an exquisite saturday lunch with a friend from singapore at the much applauded hibiscus in mayfair, it was a natural gesture and a pleasure to offer dropping them off at their hotel which in this case was the bulgari in knightsbridge. | located in a choice location almost directly opposite the infamous one knightsbridge apartments (and zuma just behind !), bulgari sits right on the main road with no driveway to boast. however the ever attending doormen are at the ready to provide a twenty pound valet service which i politely turned down, instead parking on the two pound and hour meters on trevor square just adjacent to the hotel. | as you enter the lobby you are at once impressed upon by the high gloss italian design which is pervasive from the lobby to the drinks area and through to the restaurant. there is high gloss dark wood, smooth black marble, punctuated by some more modern structures, all of which envelope you in an integral and well appointed aura, worthy of an upmarket boutique hotel. the overall effect is contemporary but warm and works well to my mind. | i was privy to a visit to the rooms which are equally well appointed and continues to exude a luxuriousness similar to that of the ground floor. the large impressive leather-bound mini bar as well as the elaborately designed bedheads do stand out, and the well sized bathroom which is through and through dark marble and italianate, is well stocked with all the amenities expected of such a hotel. | i would probably like to stay at this or a bulgari hotel at some stage, and as i am local to london it will most likely be at one of their other locations like bali or elsewhere in europe. however i will certainly be keen to return to at least try their restaurant which i read elsewhere is more palatable on corporate expense!'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''a true 5 star experience from check in to check out (which is variable based on your own arrival and departure time). beautiful decor, modern but not minimal, very comfortable rooms with well thought out amenities (love the heated floor in the bathrooms). have stayed 3 times now, and always have been accommodated in the rooms with the big walk in closet which is big enough to be a dressing room. last visit was the weekend of the jubilee festivities and the flotilla. perfect in every regard. oh - and the spa is fantastic.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel is a must if you are planning a trip to london, the attention to detail, staff, rooms and breakfast are all just perfect. i cannot express enough how good this hotel is made me and my children's trip to london so special thank you.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this hotel compares very favourably to similarly priced hotels i have stayed in london. it is very clean, the room, though typically london small, was very well laid out. the furnishings are dated and the television was very old but we found the room comfortable. the location is very convenient. breakfast was okay; lacked variety but did the job. this hotel has many redeeming qualities, and although not perfect, i would recommend it to others and i will return.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''on arrival the hotel looks most impressive,as we approached the revolving doors the doorman literally grabbed the bags off my back and insisted he would bring them up to our room. once in the hotel lobby the decor literally takes your breath away,we stood there confused for sometime not knowing where we actually checked in,eventually through the hustle and bustle of the hotel we stood patiently in line and were greeted by a member of staff who took us over to her desk,checked us in very quickly and then took us to the lift and escorted us up to our room on the seventh floor,the lift was small and slow but the member of staff made polite conversation all the way up then took us into our room. we had a standard room with very ordinary decoration,a free standing tv and a mini fridge and cupboard packed with drinks and lovely things to eat but at extortionate prices. the bathroom was very grand with a separate shower and bath tub and one bar of soap with some other designer toiliteries which i thought smelt most unpleasant and did not use very many of them, there was a beautiful granite sink. we were disappointed that there were no tea and coffee making facilities and no iron or ironing board. we waited patiently for our bags to be bought up, after 45 mins of waiting we went down to get them ourselves to find they were on there way,after another twenty minutes we phoned down to reception to ask where they were to be told they would be with us soon, we waited for an hour for them to be bought up which we thought was very poor service and we therefore wasted a huge amount of time in waiting and wish we had taken them up ourselves. | we had a function in one of the ballrooms which you old not fault,the decoration and history attached are out of this world and is truly beautiful. the food was ok but nothing special at all, almost disappointing. the service however though is outstanding and could not be faulted in anyway. | back in the room the bed was very comfortable and we had a very good night sleep,our room was facing the road but we heard no noise what so ever. | breakfast was good,lots of choice at varying prices and again a superb service. | we checked out easily and enjoyed our stay, but as it was the ""savoy"" we were really expecting something that we thought we would never find anywhere else,but unfortunately on recent trips to dubai this hotel really could not match any of the hotels that we had stayed in there. | back in t'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i brought my girlfriend to london as she wanted to visit some of the famous landmarks. i thought i would make it a special trip so wanted to book us into a top hotel in london. | after reading the reviews for mondrian, i decided to book it as it looked like it had everything i wanted in a hotel. | upon arriving i was impressed by the look of the building. inside i was impressed again by the modern and contemporary look. | check in is 3pm and we arrived at 11am. we were able to leave our bags at the hotel and then go out to enjoy ourselves. we were emailed by the reception staff when our room was ready. | when we arrived back, i had to pay a 200 deposit to cover any costs that may arise i.e. mini bar or restaurant bookings. i knew about this in advance so it was no surprise. | eventually we arrived in the room and it was exactly what we were expecting. it was not too small for us as we were not planning on spending too much time in it. the mini bar was well stocked (maybe a little over priced but then again i am northern and everything is cheap in manchester) and the bed was really comfortable. the shower in the bathroom was powerful as well which is a must when i stay away. | the next morning we went downstairs for breakfast. there was a big selection of food and drink. it was a buffet style for the hot food containing: sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, beans, tomatoes and mushrooms. there was other options as well such as cereal, pastries and salmon. | the waiters and waitresses were pleasant and kept my cup full with either coffee or tea. | on check out day we were able to leave our bags at reception for collection later in the day. | overall, i was very impressed with this hotel and would definitely stay again. the staff made us both feel really welcome and could not do enough for you.'''",2

"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''this is a lengthy review but for good reason. i travel regularly and am accustomed to both mediocrity, and also very good hotels and service. i am accustomed to service such as vip class in las vegas at notable large hotels such as the wynn, encore, bellagio and many small boutique hotels including the many relais &amp; chteaux rated properties. i have written a few reviews on various hotels on trip advisor in the past, some good and some bad. the wellesley is a challenge for me because the scale of service, quality and care of its staff is so off the cart it is hard to rate within the boundaries allowed by trip advisor. | i feel compelled to share just a few of out many experiences we had with those of you interested. i was travelling for pleasure with my wife and two young children. we arrived in london on a late saturday evening after a long days travel from canada and where taken to the hotel we had booked in knightsbridge (not the wellesley). for one reason or another the hotel had a problem and left us out in the cold without a place to stay and could not help us. we walked exhausted cases in hand to the nearest hotel we could find,the bulgari hotel, just trying to find a place to put down for the night and figure out the rest of our stay. the bulgari hotel unfortunately did to have rooms available but recommended the wellesley. thank you to our friends at the bulgari hotel for such a wonderful recommendation and taking the time to assist us! | our first contact with the wellesley was with the young lady on duty that evening via the phone ""magdalena"" who told s she could accommodate us but wanted to make sure the room would fit our needs and that we should come and have a look prior to committing, she sent a car for us immediately. edwin the driver on staff that evening came to pick us up in the beautiful black rolls royce ghost. edwin is a very special and kind fellow who we got to know and befriend over the remainder of our stay. upon arrival magdalena greeted us along with other staff who took us to our room to view. the hotel is a small boutique style hotel exuding the class and opulence of days past. our small suite was just lovely, clean, beautiful and fit for royalty or at least notable celebrity. the time was just after 11pm and we were hungry following our long day traveling and asked if he restaurant was open, magdalena let us know the kitchen was to close at 11pm but made a quick call and had the staff and chef stay on to look after our needs. the butler service came in full force to make up out room we had time to freshen up and have a lovely meal before retiring. in the moring the front desk staff was fully aware of our situation and juggled things around to make sure we had the option to stay for the remainder of our 8 nights stay. | this was just the entry to what has become the most special experience we have had in any hotel ever and anywhere in the world. the staff at the wellesley should be congratulated on the unbelievable level of service they have achieved. from every individual at the desk, the concierge, the doormen, chauffeurs, butlers, housekeeping and wonderful restaurant staff you commitment to service, friendliness, and genuine caring for you patrons is second to none (please forgive me if i missed anyone). | i want to send special thanks to edwin, magdalena, claire, warren, jason, and the doorman (who is name has slipped my mind) in specifically who made such an outstanding impression on us, please forgive me if i missed anyone in particular, you where all fantastic! | i could go on and on about the individual acts of superior service but am limited by this site, in summary, it is my opinion that if you have the option to stay at the wellesley you would be crazy to stay elsewhere.'''",2
The Dorchester,'''a select group of work colleagues set off for a day of development and indulgence and happened upon the 55 per head set menu option at the dorchester. not an every day price but perfect for this occasion and group. we had several courses with the superbly attentive staff guiding us through the wine list and describing our food before service. | the one bottle of wine we bought (the meal came with a glass each) was the lowest price on the menu at 25 but prices went up to about 8000 to suit every budget. | i also managed to squeeze in a business meeting in the lobby which is perfectly suited for such events and acted as a most impressive backdrop to the prospective business partner. | a superb visit and great value for money.''',2

The Savoy,"'''staying here for a night was one of a list of 40 things i wanted to do once i turned 40 years old last year. in essence, we were there simply for the experience. we stayed on a sunday night when rates are a little cheaper and, if you are lucky, packages are available that include dinner and breakfast. although, for these two poorly paid public sector provincials, our room rate seemed a small fortune, we were under no illusions that we were handing over much less cash than other guests in the hotel. so we fully expected to be escorted to a broom cupboard in the basement. therefore, we were astonished and delighted to be given a sizeable pad that was bright and charming, which gave us views over waterloo bridge and down the thames towards canary wharf. we could not fault it. | we had decided we would stay in the hotel for the entire 22 hours that we had available to us. we therefore spent the afternoon swimming in the hotel pool, lazing around on poolside recliners and exploring the hotel. it was the most relaxing and unhurried few hours i have ever spent in london. | we had dinner at simpsons in the strand. it did seem to take some time for us to be seated and served food, by which time i was very hungry indeed. however, once the courses started coming they did not seem to stop and i was soon on the cusp of bursting. the food was excellent. unbeknown to me, my partner had told the savoy, at the point of booking, that we were staying as part of my 40th birthday celebrations. the staff duly noted this, found me and presented with me a special pudding whilst the pianist played happy birthday. given my birthday was some months previous, i was initially convinced they had made a mistake but now i realise it is all part of an amazing attention to detail. | i was still feeling pretty full when breakfast time came around next morning. nonetheless, i was not to be defeated. again, we were given generous portions and made to feel very welcome by the staff who talked to us and made sure we had everything we wanted. it was wonderful. | we had enjoyed ourselves so much we were sad to leave. it is substantially more expensive than any hotel we would normally choose. nonetheless, for that extra money, we were given a very different experience and therefore we did not leave feeling that we had been ripped off. it was particularly noticeable that the hotel had plenty of staff willing and able to attend to the needs of guests. this contrasts greatly with the norm in the cheaper hotel chains around the country. it was not absolutely faultless but any problems, once reported, were sorted immediately. all in all, well worth doing at least once in life.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''stayed here over valentines weekend 2014. probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at. we are given a free upgrade to a executive room on arrival (possibly due to the fact i let the hotel know i was planning on proposing to my girlfriend...she said yes!) fruit dish supplied to the room after 30mins of checking in which was amazing. brilliantly room supplies...coffee machine, great bed, great bathroom, could fault it. definitely will stay here again and definitely recommend a stay!'''",2

The Dorchester,"'''i have travelled all around the world, staying in lots of different hotels. but as an experience and a story this was amazing as little 8 year old beth. yes i must admit my review may be outdated but i am sure they still live up to an amazing expectation. it was my brothers 6th birthday. my dad had ruined it by working and then being ill. so he asked my little brother what he wanted to do to make up for it. thomas only listened to his mum at this time. you could not separate the two of them. my mum had been talking about the dorchester for some time and so when the opportunity arose - guess what my brother said he wanted to do. 'dad i want to stay in the dorchester and i want to go to hamleys to buy a toy car.' so that is how it happened. i remember being a keen writer even at a young age. anywhere we would go i would write a review of the hotel. so i gave no hesitation about being honest here. i left the review for the maids and somehow it got to the manager of the hotel. i moaned at the time that they had no pool and the television did not have enough good channels. it was funny really and later i got a personal letter from the manager which i still have. as for the hotel and the room. it was spotless, the bed were the comfiest i have ever stayed in and the people really went out of their way to help. the marble bathrooms were stunning and i remember at the time just finding it so pretty. at breakfast time we all sat round in a very posh dining area. you could hear a pin drop. we all ordered our breakfast and after eating it, my brother very loudly mentioned that 'it was not as good as little chef.' my parents died, i laughed and people around dropped cutlery with a loud weighty clang. to him it obviously was not satisfactory. but i personally remember preferring it to little chef as that place is rather gross. i tell this story a lot and so just thought i would tell it here. enjoy! i want to come again as older beth and hopefully write a better review - we shall see.

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''long story short, we were rebooked to this hotel because their sister property me london could not accommodate us. bad news after a long flight across the pond. however the mondrian is really new, had the new carpet smell still, rooms are spacious. the location is kind of weird off to the southbank, closest subway stop was black friar, but still had to walk across the bridge to reach the it. staff was exceptionally nice and friendly though, since it was not close to anything, we ate at the restaurant downstairs which was really good. overall, it was a pleasant stay. one reminder though is that they gave us two towel sets when there were three guest. i do not get why they would do that'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel is just incredible! we absolutely enjoyed our stay. we told the staff about our special occasion (engagement) and when we got there, they upgraded our room and surprised us with a nice treat of champagne, strawberries and cream, chocolate and the best cake we have ever tasted in our room. what a stunning and delightful edifice in which to be, marked with joyful opulence and unrestrained grandeur. the spa - we cannot even begin to describe the divine nature of that place. 5 star is an understatement. however, as a couple we should not have been separated for our treatment. the staff were so friendly in this hotel and allowed us to literally shine. they allowed us take some beautiful photos strictly because of our occasion. who would not want to stay in a place like this? now, breakfast was just wow! that is a feast. if we eat like that everyday, we would just be fat. what incredible value for money. we love the corinthia hotel london!'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the hotel is stylish and contempory. we stayed here for our first year wedding anniversary and could not recommend it enough. the staff were so friendly especially ricardo, ed and luke..we was welcomed and made to feel at home. we made reservations for an outside resaurant but after seeing the hotels one we decided to stay and eat there. the service was great, as was the food with matching wonderful views along the southbank. the had a drink in the stylist top floor bar rumpus, the bar itself is worth a night out to visit. all in all a wonderful hotel, great food and drinks and the staff make the experience even better. | sam and conrad'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we stayed here for one night in january. our room was very spacious and the bed was super comfy. everything about the hotel is first class, service, food, drinks, concierge. we spent the afternoon in the spa which is the best i have seen in london. in the evening they have a pianist in the bar which made us stay and drink a lot more.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''went here with my partner for a 4 days long holiday. there was a good deal offer and we could not grab this chance. you would not tell this hotel is not even 1yo: top design, top location, top service. lounge areas next to the river are the big plus in here, but not as big as the greeting atmosphere staff make you feel - many thanks to max for the help and the fun throughout our stay. during the checkout i heard someone complaining about the size of his room, ours was not so huge as well, so i can understand why he pointed this topic out. i predict great future for this place even if it is not inside the city, especially if they keep arranging very competitive bundle offers like the one we chose.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we spent easter weekend at the savoy and had the most amazing experience.... particularly as members of the fairmont president's club. we were able to use 2 free night certificates, paying then just for one night. in so doing, we expected a small room without frills. we had a lovely spot on the 7th floor with a view of the river. it was much larger than expected! | upon arrival, the bellman asked our names and as soon as we made our way into the lobby, we were greeted by name by a hostess, and then by the president of the president's club program. | you can not beat the location, handy to many attractions as well as the tube. i recommend signing up for the property's loyalty program (president's club) for in-room wifi. | it will be hard to return to london and stay anywhere else!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel is in a perfect location, across the street from embankment tube station, and which has a pedestrian bridge to cross the thames where you will be at the foot of the eye... the corinthia was a 2 minute walk to trafalgar square, and literally within 10 minutes walk to almost every theatre in the west end!!!! | the beauty of this hotel is in the all the fine details... the common areas are stunning, and the restaurants are incredibly beautiful. we ate breakfast daily in northhall. our room package included a british breakfast. the food was great however we ordered our eggs as the scramble they serve are a little too liquid for our taste.... the rooms- we had a king superior our first 2 nights which was very nicely appointed.. although views are the not the strong point if this property, the room itself makes up for it. the bedroom area is wonderfully appointed with harrods brand refreshments, wonderful plates and glasses to use and a nespresso espresso machine. the bathroom is a delight with a large bathtub, an amazing shower, and nice vanity area...the only drawback is the limited sized closet.... do not expect to put a weeks worth of clothing in there.... | on our third day we experienced a horrible sewer smell.. engineering was sent and they thought they repaired the problem but an hour later when we returned to the room, the smell was even worse. the front desk manager promised to move us to another room.... my partner and i packed and waited.... i called again and was told the keys would be right up... 40 minutes later i went to the front desk to move ourselves... the manager could not have been more polite and apologetic for the delay... he immediately made keys and got a bellman cart himself to assist us with our move... he even upgraded us to a beautiful riverview suite- which was the most beautiful set i have ever stayed in europe. this was a nice way to end our stay and a wonderful example of the great service provided by the staff of this property. | the espa spa is very nice and the hydrotherapy wet area and sauna were perfect after long days of walking in the beautiful west end...'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we stayed in the family suite and loved every minute. we arrived from the states after the worst voyage ever. we were delayed for hours on the ground and so got to the savoy nearly five hours late. it was the end of fashion week in london and the afternoon of the bafta awards! the lobby was full of the tall, gorgeous and famous and then my bedraggled group arrived. we were treated like welcome guests. i cannot say enough about how special we felt because of the staff at the savoy. everyone greeted us from the housekeeping staff encountered in the hallways to our butler and the head butler and the doormen ,we were always treated as if we mattered. i will recommend the savoy to everyone and cannot wait for another opportunity to return!'''",2
The Savoy,'''main tick from my bucket list was a night at the savoy. the suite did not disappoint! the rest of the hotel was pretty amazing too. may have to delete one or two from my remaining list to revisit here.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i have visited the hotel numerous times over the last two years and every time i is wonderful. the staff are attentive but not too fussy and are always happy to help. | it is expensive but you really get what you pay for. the rooms are large, quiet with bathrooms to die for. if you are looking for somewhere to stay in central london then i cannot recommend the corinthia highly enough. i would be happy staying in the bathroom they are so luxurious! | the attention to detail is divine from the hand soap to the running maps.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''this is truly an excellent hotel. the renovation is stunning, in-room check-in and hotel orientation a welcome change from a busy lobby check-in counter, staff are all extremely professional with no pretentious attitude, (again, a welcome change from the plaza), restaurants offer excellent food at a very reasonable cost and all our room requests were accommodated; but above all, like no other hotel, the savoy has perfected a way of making you feel like a guest rather than a customer. i still cannot figure out how they did this, but upon exiting the cab from the airport and unannounced, we were greeted by name, but we were most impressed by the fact that we ate in three different venues within the hotel and all we ever provided was our room number, we were never presented with a bill or asked to sign for anything which leaves you with a warm comforting feeling of trust, they are essentially saying that we trust that you will pay for what you have purchased and that you trust them to only bill you for the correct amount. this is an exceptional hotel, an excellently located oasis in a busy city and well worth the cost.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we were given an afternoon tea for 2 as a christmas present. | the setting was amazing, you could eat as much finger sandwiches as you can then comes the scones nice selection of jams to finish some mouthwatering cakes, wash down with a nice selection of teas. | it was a leisurely afternoon and enjoyed by all'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''just spend a week here with my teenage kids and husband. we had a 2 connecting rooms. the entire hotel is absolutely gorgeous, the rooms are spacious and quiet, the shower was powerful, the lg screen tv made us feel at home and the breakfast in the their dining room was a magnificent way to begin each day. i loved looking out over hyde park and having bikes just steps away. the staff is professional and courteous and helpful. we loved our stay here and highly recommend it! the 2 bars in the hotel were lively and fun at night too!'''",2
The Lanesborough,"'''i can honestly say this was one of the best 5 star hotels i have ever stayed in, globally. | everything is taken care of and the staff have a genuine passion for their work which is rare to find in london. | from start to finish and even after visiting the 5 star service was unparalleled. | i have to mention some names that really stood out for us. | matthew (butler) amazingly friendly and professional, a real star of this hotel. he took us on a tour of the hotel as he had a spare 5 minutes, which was such a lovely gesture. | michele and vinny (bar tenders) | these guys are fantastic, everything you want from your bar tender, a great character with exquisite, intuitive service. they even remembered our drinks from our visit months before! | jamie &amp; christina (front desk) such a great choice of ladies for front of house, professional, endearing, passionate and understanding. i wanted our visit to be a surprise for my partner and they made sure it went ahead perfectly, i could not ask for better service. | the hotel itself was stunning as always, | 'practically perfect in every way' mary poppins would say. | so for the constructive feedback part, this has nothing to do with staff or the hotel itself. | i noticed the precise eye for detail in this hotel but was surprised to find no tea &amp; coffee making facilities in the room and when i requested this i was presented with a cheap,old plastic kettle and a bowl of pg tips with a few random bags of twining's teabags thrown in. not at all 5* standard. | secondly i have had a nightmare after checking out as the hotel banking system held onto the 500 deposit which left me in a sticky wicket because i had to buy some business supplies today which i could not do because there was no money left! i called jamie on reception and she looked into it thoroughly for me but said the hotels banking system had released the deposit but my bank said the hotel had not so i am still trying to sort this out even now. not a great end to what was such a lovely stay. hopefully things will be sorted out soon.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''incredibly nice place for a short stay considering the low price. perfectly equipped, clean room, great staff, no reason to complain, the metro is 5 minutes away and buses going everywhere in the city center are numerous. perfect choice to my opinion.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''take the river side rooms, the view is really nice. we were in the fourth floor, and i guess higher floors would have been better, but it was nice anyway. the location of the hotel is quite good, and the personnel was very attentive and caring. | quite correct for the price we paid.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''what a fabu place. you will be treated as a ""special"" person the second you enter the hotel. everything was perfect. location, housekeeping, room service, etc. there is one thing that we would not do the next time we stay at the savoy. i would not recommend the beef wellingon at the savoy grill. we waited 45 minutes for a nothing special, but very expensive meal.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''have just got back from a stay here. first impressions are excellent. fantastic location close to restaurants, harrods, harvey nicks, cafes etc. reception were helpful and friendly. breakfast was busy but service was quick and we could not fault the food. hot and cold with plenty of choice. the only down fall is that the rooms are slightly dated and the lifts are like something from a museum (note the carpeted walls). however it is clean and adequate. would definitely stay here again and recommend.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''... you enter the savoy. no unnecessary staff holding the walls, neither non stop may i help you. just a hush hush extraordinary overwhelmingly efficient yet discreet, may i ask of your name. then as by magic within minutes, not only they knew of my query ( spending one night with my two daughters) furthermore, with a beaming smile they all wished a very happy birthday to my daughter, who by the third wish had a head bigger than their fabulous christmas tree. | loved it loved it loved it! i am rather fussy but this experience reminded me of my childhood, when my papa used to book for us at 'the tour d'argent' paris. | our upgraded room, from just an extra bed for the three of us, to...wait for it, two double family suite. the fine lady never boosted about it, she in a very demure yet polite manner, stated that the hotel thought that maybe that would be of a better comfort. why one might ask? during the booking i did state that my daughter would be getting ready to go to her party, thus a few friends will turn up, for all to get ready. the fuss was simply a beautiful thought for the parent, who might prefer to be in another room, while just like in an apartment, the girls would be giggling away listening to some pop music. | the magic never stopped. we went for a bite to eat at their sea food restaurant. again, all synchronicity as the best non digital suisse watch.our kind waitress started by wishing my daughter a happy birthday...just when her head is now much more cylindrical than the hotel rare pieces of lalique. so.so much to write about...i ordered ostlers, my daughter chicken. excellent food even better when checking the price. much much cheaper than the fantastic wolesly, cafe royal and their equivalent. oh, the best of all is when you order a glass of wine, just one, my my, they keep the whole bottle for you, just awaiting when madam would like to have her chablis versed. | the evening arrived, the magic became real. with a friend we went to check the american bar, before our opera. a few beautiful crowd awaiting to be served. when staying there however, you do not have to cue for long. a table was ready for us. | to the savoy team, three cheers.'''",2

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''let me first say that without exception the greeting and staff were first class. breakfast was lovely, great service with lots of choice of delicious things. bread and pastries really fresh, meats, cheeses, fruit etc. usual continental fare which was included in our booking. great location, a few minutes walk to earl's ct and gloucester rd tube stns, right next door to a useful sainsburys. | so, when i read the reviews of this hotel people pointed out that the rooms were small. i was with my daughter so we had a twin room. the booking said we might be able to upgrade but apparently they were fully booked. the room was reeeaaalllly small. we were both traveling with 27"" suitcases, one of which we had to squeeze into the closet otherwise it would have had to go on the desk (and then where would the desk items go?). a good thing was that as we were on the first floor we had a door that opened on to a small balcony though we had to climb over the bed to get to it. the room overlooked cromwell rd but it was pretty quiet with the doors closed. the bathroom was also small. it was well appointed with a super shower though the lovely big bath sheet towels were almost too big to manhandle in such a small space. the bed was comfy as were the bedding and pillows. | would i return to this hotel? for the price i probably would not spend more on a bigger room at this hotel, i would forgo the niceties and get a room elsewhere with more space. although we spent most of our time out doing things, i found the lack of space, even for a short time, agitating.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection",'''i thoroughly enjoyed my 3 night stay at the xenia hotel. perfect location for touring london. easily accessed within walking distance from either gloucester underground station or earls court station. hotel amenities are great and the staff are all very courteous and helpful. | i would highly recommend the xenia hotel and will definitely be back.''',2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed here a few times now on business and always had a very good experience. the rooms are decorated very modern, a bit different to your standard hotel, with a great bar area. was lucky to get upgraded to a large room with beautiful roll top stand alone bath. had a very relaxing time. staff always welcome me back and are very efficient. the only small thing i do not like is the 12.5% discretionary service charge added to your room service bill on top of the 5 tray charge. it means if you only want a snack or starter its not worth ordering. so i have been out for food. staying on my own i have not been to any of the restaurants. planning to come back here with my husband for a weekend break soon as its in a good location on the south bank.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''good choice to stay in london. on the edge of mayfair and across the road to hyde park. under me ownership it has lost its englishness and fabled stiff upper lip so if you prefer a more subdued, exclusive atmosphere you would find it flashy perhaps bordering on naff. still a luxury hotel so rooms are lovely, service is superb. if you book through amex it becomes quite a good deal. china tang food is tasty. if you are pragmatic and do not look for what used to be but take as it is without doubt you will enjoy it.'''",2
The Rembrandt,'''staff really helpful lovel room and bathroom very very clean lovely breakfasts too ! really close to every thing and harrods we loved our time there and hope to go back soon front staff are so so helpful and kind''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''my friend and i booked our first trip to london through british airways, and chose the rembrandt based on what we thought would be a great location, and because of the wonderful value when it came time to booking. | we were not disappointed!!!! | the location of this hotel is key. right across from the victoria &amp; albert museum, and a less than five minute walk from the south kensington tube station, made it very easy to get anywhere in london and back to the hotel in record time. the staff was fantastic - very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. the hotel rooms were clean and well organized, though some better labeling of where to find the hairdryer/mini-bar/coffee maker would be great to have, since in our room they were located in areas you would not expect to find them. | the free breakfast every morning was an amazing value and wonderful to have, with tons of choices and a full english breakfast. we also ordered room service one night as we were unprepared with how early places closed on the weekends in this neighborhood, and found it to be very good, even though a tad overpriced. my only qualm about the room service is that it is advertised as 24hrs, however there is a strictly limited menu after 11pm. | all in all, we loved our choice of hotel and we will definitely be booking any future stays here!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we had a less-than-perfect 3-night stay at the corinthia in june 2013 and i wrote a less-than-stellar review here on tripadvisor. our main complaint concerned noise in the room. well, you cannot imagine how shocked i was to be contacted directly by the hotel's general manager, who without any prompting offered us a complimentary future stay -- in effect, giving us a ""do-over"" at no cost. i was very impressed with how well he listened to what i had to say, responding without any defensiveness and addressing the issues i raised. i really felt my opinions were valued. | attention to detail and making guests feel appreciated are two things that separate the best hotels from the merely mediocre. yes, it is great when a hotel gets everything perfectly right the first time, but things can go wrong even at top hotels, and the way problems are handled makes a huge difference. | we recently (december 2013 and january 2014) stayed at the corinthia twice -- taking the gm up on the free stay and also booking a paid stay -- and i am happy to report that both stays were excellent. the rooms we were assigned were some of the quietest we have experienced anywhere in london. as is often the case when we arrive in london, we were exhausted and it was so wonderful to sink into a comfortable bed and sleep uninterrupted. | we had some excellent interactions with hotel staff and found everyone very helpful. the food in the restaurant was very good. there are a lot of restaurants and theaters within easy walking distance, and the hotel's proximity to the embankment tube station makes it super convenient. | i am sure we will stay at the corinthia many times in the future.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''i stayed here on business for one night and simply had an exceptional stay. front of house staff were very professional in all aspects as were the bar staff. everyone works so hard and are so professional. | room was very clean and smart and i had a lovely night's sleep. | this is my hotel of choice when staying around bank/london bridge.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''my mother, daughter, and myself stayed march 28th thru april 2nd. we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. the hotel was very clean, bathroom spacious, very helpful staff. the breakfast bar was very good and everyone seemed to enjoy it. very close to tube station, short straight walk to the left of hotel. restuarants and shopping to the left and right of hotel. public bus stop right outside as well as a hop on/hop off tour stop right beside it. on sunday they had an antique fair inside, fun to walk thru even if not interested in shopping. conceirge arranged two cars for us during stay, very afforable considering what taxis cost.taxis were easy to catch right outside. musuems just steps away from front door. would love to stay there again!!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''loved the hotel design, modern rooms, warm bathroom floor, jacazzi with tv and technology in the room and that all in the amazing location: near the big ben, st. james park, buckingham palace and walking distance from knightbridge. and what really surprised me was that the staff knew our names despite the size of the hotel.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''i stayed at the mondrian to escape for a night and get some space. i have to say it is the perfect place for it. i went to the cinema and then had a couple of cocktails at the bar. the film was average but the small cinema was great and the popcorn was out of this world. i will go back there for their popcorn and tasty snacks - so much better than the usual unhealthy cinema sweets and snacks. | the cocktails at the bar were amazing. i had a gin and champagne based cocktail. i will go back for that cocktail alone. | it is a very cool place and it is very friendlay. i am planning a girls night out there. the view from the bar and restaurant is really beautiful at night.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i took a red eye from boston to london, but due to late departure, i barely got two hours of sleep on the plane. the very kind staff took pity on me when i arrived. somehow, they magically produced a room at 10:45am, and they upgraded me to a sweet suite. i could have kissed them just for the effort of find me an available room! | i am fresh up from a great 3 hour nap! this place is so tranquil. i did not hear a sound on the street or the halls. they have a high tech coffee machine that helped perk me up, and i am definitely taking a dip in the super deep tub. great tubs are hard to find in hotels, but this one rivals the new york plaza! i just cannot remember if the plaza has huge tvs mounted above the tub like they do here. i am tempted to spend my trip in the bathroom! | the hotel is in the middle of everything! and the staff is very helpful with my questions. i am so, so grateful i spent a bit more to stay here. even if its for one night, i recommend you stay here too and get a taste of the princess life.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the mondrian is a beautiful hotel and situated with a great view of the thames! loved the reception area and it is nod to shipping, although staff uniforms are somewhat familiar to a scene from star trek. the bedrooms were a stylish treat and the staff friendly and attentive.'''",2
The Savoy,'''two of my daughters and i had a great experience staying at the savoy. we especially enjoyed the location to get to everything that we wanted to see. the staff was exceptional from the moment we walked in. i used a fairmont upgrade certificate and it paid off with a lovely suite and a butler to boot! i slept on a foldaway cot and found it very adequate and comfy while the girls had the bed. this was a special occasion to mark a last trip together before my daughters were married. we all loved it and will cherish the memories and details of the overall experience forever.''',2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we used this hotel for a crash pad for the sunday night after a rwc2015 match. both my friend and i needed to catch early trains out of paddington. which is about 5 mins walk away. good pubs and restaurants nearby i would recommend the victoria inn. the rooms are small and clean. the beds comfy, value for money better than a travel lodge or premier inn. probably not the best for a romantic break. cannot comment on brekkie as served from 730 and we were on the train. under same circumstances would happily use again'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''london has an endless list of fabulous hotel properties and i never stay in the same place twice. it is not that i think there is always something better, i simply enjoy a new experience each time. the corinthia is elegant, chic and had excellent service. i prefer the feeling of a smaller, boutique hotel and the corinthia delivers. the public spaces are exquisite; the chandelier in the center parlor is worth a pop in if your are even in the neighborhood. the outdoor lounge with lit fireplaces is perfect for a nightcap. the rooms are lovely and very quiet which is surprising given the central location. our bathroom was simply one of the best we have had in london. it was spacious, beautifully appointed and had an amazing shower, which cannot be taken for granted even in a high-end london hotel. the walk-in wardrobe is a lovely way to feel at home. the bedroom itself was a bit small but i have come to expect that in london. only disappointment was breakfast. the service was always a bit harried and the hot food on buffet was often cold. this is a blip. i am fine with a cheddar scone and pot of tea. all in all, a really lovely 4 night stay. highly recommend and i am a tough hotel critic!'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''some people care about space and used to usa or middle east rooms' sizes. in europe, most of the hotels come in small rooms, so you better check capacity before you book then cry. the hotel itself was recently opened and it is one of the best hotels in matter of service. daily house keeping, daily complementary cakes, towels changed, room get arranged. in addition, wifi was really fast compared to a lot of hotels i stayed in, location is near earls court underground station, a hyper market at the corner with pharmacy, starbucks, travel agency, liqueur store. taxis available and hospital is few steps from the threshold. rooms are very clean with comfortable bed, the only thing we did not like was the size, but we knew beofre we book because we checked the size online. it comes with a locker and free tea/coffee'''",2

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''my partner and i booked to stay at the xenia through superbreak, along with theatre tickets to see billy elliot. a very good choice! when arriving at the hotel, check-in was smooth and the room was available straight away although we checked in early. the helpful doorman showed us to the lift, he did not explain we needed to swipe our room card in order for the lift to work. when the lift was going nowhere and it turned dark a slight panic came over us and after pressing the alarm button, the doorman then explained how to use the lift! the hotel smelt clean and fresh and when entering our room first impressions were how cosy it looked. we stayed in a classic double room and it had everything we needed. a lovely clean bathroom with l'occataine toiletries, big fluffy towels, tea and coffee facilities with biscuits and a bottle of water. these are only a few things to mention. the room was quite small but absolutely fine for what we needed. the hotel is in an excellent position, a short walk from gloucester road tube station. we had the full breakfast in the morning which you could help yourself to the continental buffet that had a wide variety of food to choose from, fresh food and then our choice off the menu. my partner had a full english breakfast and i had the scrambled egg and smoked salmon on toast. both were very well presented and possibly the best breakfast we have had. both of us were very impressed with the hotel and agreed we would definitely stay at the xenia again. we look forward to it!!'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i originally found this hotel on expedia, but decided to contact the hotel directly. i actually paid less contacting the hotel and booking it online through the hotel, rather than through expedia. the room was exactly as described and it was clean and had everything i needed. i even had a private balcony that had a nice view. it is close to hyde park and i took a very nice walk. the continental breakfast was very good and it was more than i needed. slept like a bear and felt the staff was very nice. when i checked in the gentleman at the desk offered to carry my bag upstairs for me, it was unexpected, and i appreciated it very much after a long day of travel from canada. i would recommend this hotel, it is not the ritz or the fairmont, but it is wonderfully located, and it was exactly as described. very clean, would stay there again!'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed here for 3 nights a couple of weeks ago. our room was excellent and very clean, there was 3 of us and the sofa bed which our daughter slept in was extremely comfortable and larger than the sofa beds in many other hotels. the reception staff were friendly and curteous as was the concierge. | buffet style breakfast was good, plenty of choice - fruit, cereals, breads and the usual fry-up components. we were down fairly early each day for full days of sightseeing and although busy with folk coming and going, we were seated promptly and fully enjoyed our breakfast. | not knowing the geography of london the hotel was picked mainly due to the price and it certainly did not dissappoint us. straight across the road is the v&amp;a museum and also a pick up point for the hop-on, hop-off bus, very handy! a little bit further is the science museum and natural history museum and who would not want to be a mere 5/10 minute walk from harrods? | all in all we had a great stay and would definitely recommend the hotel.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''we booked a trip to london to celebrate our sister's 60th birthday, and as a special treat had afternoon tea at the dorchester. this turned out to be the highlight of the visit. the service was brilliant, the staff could not have been more friendly, they went out of their way to make my sister feel special. must also mention the pianist ""adam"", who found the time to chat to us and who played a selection of our requested tunes, he could not have been more obliging. the actual ""tea"" itself was excellent. we were only sorry that the time went by so quickly.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we recently stayed at the savoy for two nights to celebrate my birthday and wish we could have stayed longer, this hotel is just awesome. | we have stayed here several times before and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. the rooms are wonderful, beautifully decorated with marble bathrooms and the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. the service and staff are first rate, friendly, professional and who make you feel both very special and very much at ease. the birthday cake and greeting was a lovely personal touch, thanks to everybody who made our stay so enjoyable and cannot wait to see you all again.'''",2

Rhodes Hotel,"'''we have stayed at the rhodes hotel several times, and wil certainly do so again. the rooms are small, but the beds are very comfotable. the staff is very friendly - especially in the breakfast room. the hotel is close to the tube, and there are a lot of nice restaurants in the area'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''excellent value for a 4* hotel in the centre of london. the hotel location at the weekend is very quiet, and really close to the part of town i was visiting. what always makes a stay such a pleasure at the apex is the hotel staff, they are friendly, efficient and always ready to help out, 10 out of 10.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''fantastic hotel, great bar and restaurant within a 3 minute walk to bank station. the staff were friendly and helpful. the only criticism would be that the room doors really could do with soft close mechanisms as the doors are very loud.'''",2
The Savoy,'''our first time staying here. a beautiful and well maintained property with excellent service and great food. the location adjacent to covent garden and overlooking the thames is just perfect. we had a deluxe king with a river view. the room was lovely and had an excellent spacious bathroom.''',2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we arrived at the hotel early, everyone was very friendly and helpful and the icing on the cake was our room was ready, always a bonus. the room was well presented, very clean and superbly equipped (now for the only minus of the stay) but very small for a double. back to all the good points. the public areas of the hotel have been designed to be sophisticated but warm and inviting. the staff were all very attentive. we did not eat at the hotel in the evening but breakfast was a delight, again the restaurant dcor was excellent, the cold buffet was varied and all fresh, the cooked breakfast was delicious and cooked beautifully. nothing was to much trouble. would go back tomorrow, although i might upgrade to a bigger room.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''from the moment we arrived and the doorman opened the car doors welcoming us to the savoy to the time we walked out the door, we were treated to excellent service from every member of staff. this just how the savoy operates! everyone and everything is expected to be excellent and that is just how it was during our entire visit. | we stayed over night on new years eve to celebrate. our junior suite was excellent overlooking the forecourt of the hotel. everything in the room perfect. no detail had been overlooked in preparing the room and after we arrived a lady even came to make sure all was in order, that we were happy and that the orchids were perfect (each plant must have a minimum number of blossoms). | the bed was sumptuous to say the least. soft down pillows, perfectly pressed linens and a lovely soft cashmere throw. our dressing room was a bit dark so we asked our butler if it was possible to have another lamp brought in. no worries - one arrived promptly. our bath was perfectly warm and lovely. | as we were preparing for a special night we were wearing our tuxedos. our shoes needed a bit of a polish - ask the butler and they were back in 10 minutes. ""any thing else i can help you with sir?"" he was the perfect gentleman and nothing was too much to ask. ice bucket to chill the champagne - done. ""would you like the ice refreshed when you go to dinner sir?"" yes, please. ""i will be sure that is done whilst you are at dinner."" | cocktails at the american bar and the beaufort bar were both amazing. the beaufort is our favourite just being off the main dancing area which featured a full band with a lovely singer. | dinner in kaspars was superb starting with ""seafood decadence"", the best fillet of beef i have eaten in many a year, followed by an amazing desert. our server was excellent, knowledgeable and very helpful. | viewing the fireworks over the thames from the restaurant windows was perfect of course accompanied by complimentary champagne. | breakfast served in our suite the next morning arrive piping hot in a small warming cabinet cleverly built beneath the table that is brought into your suite. delicious as one would expect. | all is all a very memorable and wonderful stay at the iconic savoy!'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we booked this hotel through british airways holidays and it was really an excellent choice.the entire reception staff and the restaurant staff were more than helpful and courteous.our room was large enough, clean and quiet.english or continental buffet breakfast was available every morning and the food quality was high.the nearby south kensington metro station was a great convenience, served by main piccadily,circle and district lines.these underground lines take a visitor anywhere from heathrow to main attractions in central london, including the king's cross train station.the entire area is safe, beautiful and upper-class.interesting museums,the harrods department store and hyde park can be reached on foot in minutes. could not expect more!'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''i am glad i found this hotel. the location could not be better! right across the street from the victoria and albert museum, and the knightsbridge neighborhood made us feel like londoners. breakfast was excellent and for lunch and dinner there were numerous restaurants around. the tube was just steps away. when i go to london again, i will definitely stay here.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we enjoyed another return visit to the rembrandt, this time for three nights. | the hotel is well located for tourists in the museum quarter at the w end of knightsbridge. there are excellent public transport links nearby, including three underground lines one of which is a direct link to heathrow. both upmarket retail therapy and a wide range of restaurants are also close to the hotel. | the rembrandt is a straightforward four-star with no frills but with all one can reasonably expect from this grading in central london, including a friendly and efficient front desk and concierge staff. the dcor is not exciting, either in the public areas or rooms but it does not offend. there is an adjacent independently-managed spa and pool (extra cost but the fees are reasonable). | room size and quality varies, typical of london hotels that are conversions of buildings built for other uses (the rembrandt was originally a hostel for staff working in nearby harrods). we were upgraded to a club room, which was compact and well-equipped (especially the desk area). everything worked. | breakfast is a comprehensive buffet with quality food, attentive staff and some dishes cooked to order. the room can be crowded and the atmosphere is somewhat industrial. | wifi is free, fast and simple to use. the hotel also lends guests a complimentary smartphone. | overall, the rembrandt is a well-managed experience and good value-for-money in an expensive city. in context, we rate it 5/5. recommended.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''booked this hotel on the basis of reviews and would say that other recent reviews cover our experience both good and bad. we booked via booking.com but a few days before our stay we received an email inviting us to upgrade to a river view room for 35. it was a mondrian web link and unfortunately i did not print out the page to take with me. when we arrived we were allocated a room with a view of the buildings at the back. we were told that an upgrade to a river view would have been over 80 and that we were mistaken. we were taken to an alternative room which was not made up and then the assistant manager (inga) sorted it all out (she was very pleasant) and we did have the river view room on the third floor. it was suggested that the problem was with booking.com, which it could not have been, or with us as we must have misunderstood the offer, (we did not). the 35 for the upgrade did not include vat (not clear on the website). in common with other reviewers we were surprised by the 100 pre-authorisation on the credit card - perhaps they have a high proportion of customers not paying, but it does give the impression that customers are not trusted which is unfortunate. once we had been allocated the correct room, we had a great view, the bed was comfortable and it was nicely furnished. the bath towels were luxuriously large and fluffy - always a good point! bathroom products were lovely and there was a magnifying mirror - also a plus! great shower too. and it was quiet. so we loved the design and the room but the embarrassment caused by having to stand our ground over our booking and being trailed round the hotel did spoil our stay a bit (a wedding anniversary trip). our reservation did not include breakfast and we had a booking elsewhere for dinner so we did not use the restaurants (might have had breakfast there had we felt more comfortable about our experience). the bar was lively and fun. the staff were pleasant - but not that interested in our stay or what we had done while there. they are busy, but our best experiences have always been where the reception staff make sure you have relevant local information and then ask how you enjoyed your stay (and take an interest in the reply). to summarise all that - it would be good if they sorted out the admin. do take copies of every scrap of correspondence with you, be aware that you will be asked to pre-authorise your card and then enjoy the location, views and the smart modern dcor.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''my husband &amp; i recently spent a week in london , staying at the rembrandt. our ba flight from las to lhr landed in terminal 5. after clearing customs, we walked directly to the piccadilly line of the tube in t5 &amp; using the quest cards we would ordered on-line, boarded the train for direct service to south kensington station. one block from the station was the rembrandt, a most welcoming sight after our ten hour flight. room was well equipped (electronically, esp.) &amp; though small, absolutely acceptable. the v&amp;a is directly across the street, three tube lines are accessed at the south kensington station, royal albert hall is an easy walk &amp; good restaurants abound (check out the handra indian). hotel staff was professional, the lounge, comfortable &amp; the breakfast was typically adequate. there is a cab stand in front of the hotel, several bus lines stop nearby, &amp; the rembrandt is now our first choice in london. next time, we will bump up to the executive level, but even the superior level rooms are absolutely fine...the rembrandt has well deserved ta ratings.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my husband and i chose to stay at corinthia for the first part of our london trip -- what a wonderful experience! the hotel is an easy walk to many points of interest, room is well-appointed and the thermal floor is luxurious! service was impeccable too. for the second part of our london trip, we stayed at the langham hotel....we missed the corinthia experience!'''",2
The Rembrandt,'''it is really a 3 star hotel with a bit below par service. internet and free breakfast are great. but no ventilation in the bathroom!! they oversell the healthclub attached..it is one of the oldest gyms i have ever been to. i moved to intercontinental after 2 days of stay. good for extremely budget senstive folks. very good location. food so so..''',2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my second stay. staff brilliant; all friendly and very pleasantly informal. the hotel has a groovy vibe and the location, right on the river with direct access to the thames walkway makes a huge difference to the feel of staying in the city. super breakfast and great atmosphere in the bar.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''this was my 3rd stay at the rembrandt. it is a good hotel with many excellent features. my only criticism was that my 12 hour international flight from the us landed in the morning at heathrow, as normal, so when i arrived at the rembrandt at 11 am, the reception clerk demanded extra payment to give me the room prior to the 2 pm check-in time. i travel a great deal internationally and i just hate it when hotels do this to me as a poor tired traveler. i had prepaid for 3 nights, the room was empty and available and waiting; but she would not give it to me. a few other hotels do the same, but not very many and i find it extremely annoying. probably will not stay at the rembrandt again which is a shame since it really is a good hotel. i changed to another hotel on the strand 3 days later where i arrived at 10:45 am and they gave me the room right away with no upcharge.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''we took advantage of one of their winter offers,three courses and a glass of champagne for 49 a head.great food,good service and atmosphere. a bottle of wine on top however is not cheap! by the time we would had a bottle of wine,plus the | ''optional "" 12.5% service charge,it came to nearer 80 a head,which i suppose is still reasonable for a top london restaurant. | overall...recommended!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''the hotel is very clean as new,, room are spacious and very well furnished | staff very helpful and polite | location is central and just few meters from underground station | very quite and romantic | best hotel ever'''",2
The Savoy,'''visited kaspar's seafood bar and grill - food was really fresh and tasted great. i would recommend the scallops to start with and the peach melba for dessert. i also had the grilled cod for the main which was tasty. service was a little slow but other than that was great.''',2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''5/5 for the service - the food-the ambience, no words can describe the experience!!!! | well done! the highlight of our trip to london! | the rooms and hotel very clean with well trained staff and amazing service! | fantastic cocktails too! we will be back....soon'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''my dream has always been to celebrate christmas in the city of dickens. my second dream has always been to stay at the dorchester hotel. well, let me start by saying londoners love christmas and the holidays. everyone has a smile and a ""merry christmas"" on their lips! though the weather outside was frightful, the atmosphere inside the dorchester was so delightful. this hotel lives up to it is name as one of ""the best hotels in the world"" 5 stars all the way. from when first you arrive and throughout our stay, which unfortunately ends tomorrow, the staff has shown such wonderful kindness and friendliness, that we felt like royalty, or at least a-list pop stars. i rarely write reviews for anything. but this wonderful place deserves one from a lazy sod like myself. be sure, that we will return year after year. thank you dorchester for the best christmas ever!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''this hotel is incredibly grand and the rooms are old school glamour! | the service amazing, location is fine (not much around) but 10-15 walking distance to the shops. | the restaurant is very good too, definitely worth a try if you do not feel like venturing out. | well appointed rooms and has all the bells and whistles you will ever need being in a hotel.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''i booked this hotel in a package with british air.my usual west end hotels having had their prices launched into the stratosphere .unfortunately due to hurricane sandy i was forced to stay 3 days longer than i had booked..my 1st room booked as part of the package was excellent, somewhat larger than the usual rooms at a hotel of this class.as the week went on both my room and the prices kept going up while the square footage went lower.i ended up in a closet sized room in the garret for 50% more than my 1st room.i cannot really hold it against them, so many people forced to stay over,i am sure they filled the place. except for the restaurant manager the staff was considerate and helpful.the location , across from the victoria and albert museum,around the corner from the south kensington tube,and just a few block from harrods, could not have been better.'''",2
The Lanesborough,"'''from my first enquiring email to the end of my visit, i can not praise the lanesborough and all members of staff highly enough, i arranged a surprise afternoon tea for my mum's birthday, the attentiveness shown to us during our visit was exceptional, the afternoon tea was amazing, the staff knowing we were on short time scale kept an eye on the watch and had a cab waiting so we could relax and enjoy every second of our visit....thank you all for making our visit a truly unforgettable experience'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''i came to the rembrandt because i wanted to be near to the museums - especially the natural history museum. the hotel is a simply tube ride (piccadilly) from kings cross to south kensington tube station, which is also served by the district and circle lines. this means that the hotel's location is perfect for so many connections. harrods is just a walk up the street. the v&amp;a, natural history and science museums are just across the street - literally!! hyde park, trafalgar square and the theatres are all so quickly reached via nearby tube stops. it makes london seem so accessible!! | the hotel is extremely well presented and the receptionist was perfectly charming - a grand start i thought. the lifts had to be operated with a swipe of your room card - i am really not sure whether i found this a comforting security or an irritating inconvenience, especially when just nipping down to dinner/breakfast and having to remember to swipe! | i ate in the dining room on my first night - pleasantly sumptuous - i had the whole restaurant to myself. i do not think i have ever felt so peculiar and yet so special in my life! the food was delicious and i topped it off with a glass of champagne - well, i was on holiday! | the same room at breakfast time was absolutely overwhelming with people everywhere - a total contradiction to the previous evening! | i found the staff to be extremely pleasant and most helpful - from the cleaning staff to the restaurant/bar staff. i find this makes the stay all the more welcoming. | my room was classed as a 'superior double' and i have to say that i was a little disappointed, initially, at the size of it. but i guess that i forgot i was in london and space is a prize commodity. i will admit that, whilst it was compact, the room grew on me and i felt very cosy in it. it was well presented and had a jacuzzi bathroom - a sweet treat after a day around the museums....ahh! | i did, however, muse over the collapsible luggage holder because, if i had have extended it, i could not find the space to put it out - except at the bottom of the bed, which would mean clambering over the bed to shut/open the curtains! i left it closed up between the tv unit and the bathroom wall and put my suitcase in the wardrobe. | i have to admit that if there had been two of us in this room, i think that we would have 'fallen over' each other - this 'superior double' was ample for one person. | all in all, i loved this little gem of a hotel. i think it is located in the most convenient and accessible area for radiating out to visit places around london. | i will certainly use the rembrandt hotel again - and i suggest that you try it for yourself!'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''spent two nights at the xenia hotel in kensington, our twin room was small but perfectly formed and immaculately clean with everything you could need. the staff were lovely and could not have been more helpful. the continental breakfast was very good indeed. overall an excellent hotel with fabulous service.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''my friend and i stayed in a twin room in the annex which, despite its size, was extremely comfortable and had a newly remodeled bathroom featuring a shower with massage jets. both the room and bathroom were spotless (crisp clean sheets and towels changed daily). | the rhodes is extremely well-located for public transport with paddington station (national rail, heathrow express, bakerloo/district/circle/hammersmith &amp; city lines) and lancaster gate tube station (central line) only a short walk away. alternatively, a short ride on the bus will take you to the main shopping and dining areas. | the owners chris and maria were both very friendly and helpful and made our stay extremely pleasant. maria let me have a look at the quint room located in the main building as i will definitely book this hotel again for a future trip with my family.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i have been lodging into this hotel several times, it is at present my most preferred choice of hotels in london. is within walking distance from the city of londo, so it is ideal for business trips together with still walking distance of some key west end location, such as the covent garden almost oposite. | public transport is yet again one of its gigantic advantages.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i have been very fortunate to have stayed in some really nice hotels in asia. this is in my view one of the best hotels i have stayed in ever. the hotel is really beautiful just off the embankment station, minutes away from trafalgar square and many other attractions. i literally walked to almost all of the attractions as the walk by the thames river is really very pleasant. | the room i got on the fourth floor in the corner was really nice. i agree with another reviewer who said that the room is very well proportioned. whilst a large room can be luxurious to some, i do not fancy a large empty room. the room is as goldilocks would put it ""just nice""; cosy but not cramped. | there is a nespresso machine and the bathroom floors are heated along with the towel rails which is such a treat when the weather outside turns dreary and cold as i am told london weather can be. the toiletries that they provide is really great. the tv in the bath is such a luxury and the acoustics work. | the gym was very well equipped. the pool however was tiny, but beautifully done. even the common shower and changing room at for the spa and gym. staff were really professional and nice, especially liked the doormen. there is a small harrods in the hotel if you need to grab some souvenirs before you fly out. | i have said loads of nice things but i do have a few comments for improvement. had breakfast there every morning. it was great the first two days but really got quite bored with the food at breakfast by day three. i am from asia and i suppose we are spoilt when it comes to food choice. would have been nice if they made small changes though, having the same sausage every morning . . . not too keen. | the room was warm, even though i turned the temperature down. suffering from jet lag it took me a day to figure out not to keep the toilet doors open as the floor heating was compensating for the cold/cool air. the hotel may want to look into this as it would, increase their energy bill if unknowing people like me keep toilet doors open. | otherwise this is really a great hotel.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''felt very safe and secure, even though i was staying alone. room was small and i would not have enjoyed this if i had been staying for long, but i only stayed one night and left early in the morning for work. big tv in room and air con were great. definitely good for the price!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''it is lovely to arrive and find that you have been upgraded to a nice suite with a living room and two baths. from the check in to the check out the service is impeccable, they greet you by name, they are polite to a fault, and pay attention; i used most of my body lotion and next morning they had left me an extra one. the bed linens are fabulous, lots of fluffy pillows. we left early in the morning and ended up forgetting the computer charger in the room, we stopped after the weekend and they could not immediately locate it, it happens sometimes, it is a big hotel... well... they were so upset about it, made it their mission to find it, the manager john and the front desk staff were all over it. they found it and messengered to us. if i forget something again i want it to be there. the location is great, close to everything. the bar is nice and the bartender a great old school one. would return again. one has to give thumbs up to top service. thank you again.'''",2
The Lanesborough,'''had a great experience at the lanesborough. the hotel is differentiated from other top london hotels by the personal service provided by the staff. | room was a very generous size and perfectly presented. any requests we had during our stay were promptly dealt with by the butler/ concierge. | my husband had booked me a pregnancy massage in the spa and the hotel staff left some teddies in our room for our new arrival which was a nice touch. | quality of spa facilities are excellent. | had dinner in the restaurant- ambiance was very special and food was enjoyable however portion size was fairly small. | would definitely return in future for a special occasion.''',2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i stayed at the mondrian for four nights last week, which was its opening week. like other morgan's hotels, the standard rooms are not enormous but offer attractive contemporary furnishings and are overall very comfortable. in particular, positives that i noted: the bathroom was lovely and spacious with a walk-in shower featuring great fixtures and water pressure, and i always love the malin &amp; goetz bath products morgans provides; the us-compatible outlet above the desk was very handy; black out curtains were a big help; fitness center is well equipped with new cardio equipment and weights, although they could use a filtered water dispenser; common areas and bars are very nicely appointed and comfortable; staff were friendly and helpful. the mondrian's location is pretty accessible, within walking distance to waterloo and southwark stations; not much in the way of good, close-by dining beyond the hotel but good restaurants are walkable (recommend both union street cafe and anchor &amp; hope). my room was on a low floor in the back of the hotel, facing an apartment building with a street view, about as far from the elevator as you can get - making it less noisy with pretty much no foot traffic, but no landmark/water view. they have a few kinks to iron out - particularly the lifts, some of which seemed to not be operating all of the time - and the closet space is very limited, but other than that it was a very comfortable and pleasant place to land for a business trip.'''",2

Apex London Wall Hotel,'''smallish size business hotel. rooms are typical european size. one thing i noticed is that because there are only a few rooms on each floor it is very quiet. you do not hear the slamming doors or talking in the hall that you hear in large hotels. the rooms are clean well designed. shower is a good size and good water pressure. it is very close to finsbury circus. they have complimentary rubber duckies for every guest. good if you do not have time to pick up a gift for a little one.''',2

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i stayed 3 nights here with my friend. service is truly top notch! | from the doorman to the concierge to the reception to the housekeeping to the in room dining to the breakfast with a view of hyde park, i must say everyone made sure we felt truly at home in the hotel. | kudos to everyone at the hotel! good job! | the room itself though was showing signs of aging with pretty old furnishings both in design as well as state of maintenance. drawings were dull and while a retro grand feel was hoped, did not really come across in execution. and wats surprised me was the lack of toiletries in the room. perhaps it was the class of the room we stayed in since it was only the knightsbridge room but having paid a relatively high price for the room, i was expecting some minimum stuff like toothbrushes and tooth paste and shaving kit without having to asked for it. i could probably forgive the layout of the room given the hotel is in a conservation building (i think), but for this class of hotel...and having shower in bath tub for me was not really nice...i was expecting separate shower stall. | i had drinks at the rose berry...was not anything to shout about...but dinner by heston blumenthal was good! service excellent and i like the dress code. i gave up going to really classy restaurants and always being reminded of the dress code. but this restaurant is amazing. | but overall, this is still a good hotel with a very sound crew onboard knowing exactly all the right buttons to press! and not forgetting the location of the hotel which is right smack in knightsbridge. it is walking distance to harrods, harvey nichols and sloane street just opposite and with hyde park at the back, it is simply outstanding! and for those of you who rely on the tube, it is just right at the corner. | come stay. but if you prefer the smell of new hotels...not here til they refurbish the place.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''we were on holiday from tasmania and i had always wanted to go there and have high tea in the promanade, as my mother went there when she was at school, and had often spoken of it. well we went and what a treat, the high tea is on another level completely from other places. loved it and next time we will also stay at the hotel. thankyou for a memorable evening.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''having gone to london for a random day out, our car decided to misbehave, so knowing we were unable to get home (2hrs away) we checked into the dorchester....we were not dressed to the nines, and probably looked a little dishevelled, yet the staff could not have been more helpful, friendly and accomodating, upgrading us to a wonderful suite with a jacuzzi bath, lounge and dining room! we have stayed in many hotels, but will now go out of our way to stay here! the front of house staff were fantastic.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''best hotel i have ever stayed in. beautiful, clean, friendly and a great location to explore london. from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were treated like royalty. we were also given a room upgrade at check in at no cost without us requesting one. they even gave our son some beautiful hand made chocolates when we arrived, well presented on a platter. although a little expensive, it is definitely worth every penny!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we chose apex london wall after all the positive reviews on trip advisor and the great summer rate. it is on a quiet street but within walking distance of restaurants, the tube and bus stops. after busy days of sightseeing, it was great to soak in the huge tub and get a great nights sleep in the king size bed. staff were very helpful and courteous and we especially appreciated their being able to meet our request for an early check-in. after a long sleepless flight from canada, it was wonderful to get a little shut-eye before heaing out to explore london. so thanks to the staff for making our stay a great one. we would certainly recommend this hotel to friends or family who are planning a trip to london.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''arrived early and given access to our upgraded executive room - an excellent start! the room was on the first floor facing the busy cromwell road but had zero residual traffic noise due to the very good double glazed windows. the hotel had a touch of class throughout being nicely furnished and with attentive, friendly staff. | continental breakfast, included in the rate, was very good and served in a spacious, bright dining room. | only slight disappointment was that no whole milk was available at breakfast. restaurant manager indicated that they just do not provide it any more. strange decision at a classy hotel. | thank you lesley for a most enjoyable stay.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''it was our first stay here and we stayed as a birthday celebration for my husband. we had a 1 bedroom river view suite which was beautiful. fabulous views, spotlessly clean, and lovely bathroom with huge shower and roll top bath. | we went to the famous american bar for a drink but the dowdy dcor and surly,abrupt unwelcoming staff spoilt the experience. | i agree with the reviewer who commented on the lack of flowers. i was expecting fragrant floral displays in the foyer but there was virtually nothing. | we ate in kaspars and the grill, both were excellent. | so in conclusion i feel that we will probably return to our original favourite hotel in london, but maybe arrange to visit the savoy restaurants again.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''a luxury hotel in the city of westminster, the savoy is now managed by fairmont hotels. | one of londons most famous hotel, the savoy boasts of pomp and grandeur, having played host to many celebrities and entertainers. | celebrity chef gordon ramsays savoy grill allows you to experience 1920s style dining in the savoy.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''the staff and service here are first class all the way. the rooms are very luxurious. my room overlooked the park. great location for easy walking if you want. we were treated like royalty. in fact, royalty was actually there at the time. pricey, but if you can afford it, you cannot do much better in london.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''went for two nights at a short stop in london. staff was very professional and friendly, went out of their way to find a room with our extra request and offered us a free drink at the bar for a ten minute wait till the room was ready. bags were brought to our room at the same time. clean rooms, and some complimentary items. one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in, and will definitely go back for our next visit to london. the hotel restaurant was also decent for a hotel.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''would definitely stay here again on returning to london! | location: hotel is literally opposite the v&amp;a museum and close to south kensington tube station. location is good as it is a nice area, safe but is a decent way from oxford street, leicester square etc... about a 1/2hr to 40 minute walk but an easy tube ride. | rooms: | comfortable but a bit small... but reasonable size compared to other rooms in london/europe | has everything you need including free wifi. | breakfast: | good spread and decent breakfast... would get it if there is a special one that includes breakfast in the price | service: | great service and wonderful staff. my wife left something behind when we left and we rang up the next day and they found it and organised to get it posted to us in paris. pablo from concierge and elina from house keeping we are particularly helpful and should be commended for going out of their way to help us out!'''",2
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''i just loved this hotel! it is location is amazing! great restaurants in walking distance, harrods just across the street, hyde park and winterwonderland also across the street, it does not get any better! | the rooms are modern and clean, nice design. | the a la carte breakfast is good. the bar has a lively atmosphere in the evenings. | i totally recommend it!!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''unfortunately high end hotels in london are hit and miss whereby they are either ultra modern or disturbingly old fashioned, the dorchester gets the balance just right. | from reception, through to the public areas and the rooms there is an element of class that one would expect from parklane. the architecture of the building is a little misleading as it is almost something you would expect to find from your benidorm style resorts, but that comparison stops there. | the reception team were friendly and curteous, possibly a little too rehearsed but very pleasant never the less. | after checkin in we went to our room and was pleasantly surprised by the size for a 'central london' hotel. the decor was classy and seating and the beds very comfortable. | we ate in the restaurant that evening and this is probably where my own niggle occurred. it took quite a long time to be visited at our table for our food and drinks order. when our drinks arrived we both received prosecco and not the 2006 dom perignon as order, quite the difference. | we also asked for some water which the waiter somehow managed to spill on to my partner, not an issue accidents happened and they were very apologetic. | our food arrived, we ate from alain ducasse which was exceptional. | we both started with the mushrooms and i had the duck for main and my partner the venison. again this took a long time to arrive, not because of the kitchen but there seemed like there was some disorganisation going on amongst the front of house team, could not quite work out what. | it was a bit of a clouded affair really because we were celebrating moving back to the uk and london particularly and we just felt it was a bit chaotic and rushed, even though the food was literally exceptional. | when i asked the waiter if everything was already this evening he barked at me, yes why would not it be, have not you been here before?! nice haha. | that said the stay was wonderful and comfortable but i;m not sure i would return to eat here again based on this experience. quite often we will go to other fine dining establishents where the service is a little more refined.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i am always a little wary of budget hotels in london, but the ridgemount caught my eye thanks to stellar ratings on tripadvisor. | it turns out they are well deserved. | from the welcome i got on arrival, all the way through to breakfast the next day, it was about as homely and comfortable as it gets in a hotel. | my room was spotlessly clean, warm, comfortable, quiet and the shower was great. breakfast was great, with a kind of bed &amp; breakfast feel from the staff - warm, friendly and more like kindly relatives than hotel staff. | i am very happy to be booked in again for next week, and equally disappointed there is no suitable availability for me at the ridgemount for the week after. it is certainly a place i want to keep returning to.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''our group were 6 and we did have a lovely time and the service was very good. the first 2 courses were excellent but the variety of cake at the end left a little to be desired with only 2 choices and just put onto 4 plates and left in the middle and when asked if we could take them home, were advised that they do not do that anymore. bring back the cake and pastry trolley. also a little disappointed with the dress code, we had all made an effort to dress but there were a lot in tatty jeans and sloppy jumpers. overall we did enjoy ourselves but being in a party helped.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed for five nights with two kids in a riverfront suite with a large terrace. the kids slept on a comfortable pullout sofa that faced a large flatscreen tv. (the king bed had its own tv too.) | i picked the hotel for the location along the river. brilliant to be able to just head out and walk along the thames west towards london eye and parliament or east towards tate modern, tower bridge, etc without having to deal with vehicles (ideal for naughty toddlers who tend to run away). | the hotel is very stylish like the other mondrian hotels and i definitely feel this one is classier than the other two we have stayed at (miami, nyc). | our stay coincided with the attack in borough market and the hotel was very good about alerting guests via the tv screens to stay away from the london bridge area that night. | i would not hesitate to book this hotel again on a future stay. | (when i made the booking online i noted that we were celebrating a big birthday and the hotel had a bottle of champagne on ice for us in the room.)'''",2
The Savoy,'''we have stayed in top hotels around the world but have yet to find one that matches the savoy. all the staff are 'thinking people' and as a consequence the service is personalized and exceptional. the small touches are also noted and appreciated; unstinting measures of most things from orange juice and toast at breakfast to measures of 'wine by the glass'. fresh and not plastic or silk flowers give an authentic ambiance that sits well with the atmosphere of the whole place. not cheap but worth every penny particularly if it is to mark an occasion.''',2
The Dorchester,"'''i stayed in the dorchester quite some time ago now, but the experience still lives with me a couple of years on. i became engaged to my wife here, and staff went out of their way to accommodate my plans. i am not the kind of visitor who can usually afford to stay in such luxury, and even a single night's stay in the cheapest possible room required some significant saving on my part, but at no time was i made to feel unwelcome or that the hotel was ""beyond me"". on the contrary, everything about my experience was as good as it possibly could have been. | the suite we were in was exceptional - immaculately clean, tastefully furnished and of outstanding quality, finished off with unbeatable views over hyde park. there was even a bottle of champagne on ice waiting for us in the room, compliments of the manager. this touch was the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me - especially in a hotel. the bath in the room was deep and spacious, and the bed was plump and relaxing - i just did not want to go to sleep! | the dorchester grill is equally amazing. again, it was the most expensive meal i have ever eaten, costing something in the region of 150 for three courses with wine (and several different ones at that) for two. this may be a standard spend for some people at this hotel, but for me, it was unique - and a memorable treat at that. i was greeted at my table by the head waiter by name, and made to feel like a welcome house guest. the wine list was well-chosen and of an excellent variety. the food was simply outstanding, and two years later i can still taste the steak and chips i had. they are yet to be beaten. | the following morning's breakfast was served in our room - again, making us feel extra special. it was the most memorable breakfast i have ever had, and not just because i would got engaged the night before. the selection catered to a variety of world tastes, but even my (now) wife's choice of ""coco pops"" was taken care of - ""sir, they are one of our most popular choices,"" i was told in all sincerity by the catering team. almost needless to say, the cooked offerings were of the highest order. it was like something out of a bond movie, having champagne at breakfast in a luxury hotel. | two years on and i am still raving about that one night i spent at the dorchester. i heartily recommend it to all of my friends and family, even though i have never been able to afford to go back. if you have a special occasion, or just want to experience the best that the hotel industry can offer, then you owe it to yourself to try the dorchester. one night here is worth a fortnight anywhere else. simply exceptional.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the details and the service made the big difference | everything worked with total attention, care and caring | i should recommend this hotel and the people of the breakfast restaurant that worked a lot for us'''",2
London Guest House,"'''i was looking for a room in london for 6 nights, with parking, for about 60 per night | sadly their listing hotels.com has not been configured correctly, when parking is selected this guest house disappears (listed as no parking) | the guest house is very easy to find, and i was able to park on the street in order to check in | i was advised about everything i needed to know, then given my key to room 104 | the room was in the basement directly under reception | the facilities were as expected, with tea, coffee and kettle | whilst the room has a tv, it is in an unusual location and very high up on the wall without any form of adjustment | there is plenty of lighting, and probably too many options of switches! | there is a small fridge in the cupboard, but due to this location the ventilation was poor and as a result it was operating all the time | finally, there was a room safe | not only was it locked (and it can be used), it was not actually fitted to anything and was simply sitting the shelf so could have been removed from the room with ease, sadly making it completely pointless | the shower room initially was very good | however as time went by the inadequacies started to show | firstly one of the two doors had no handle and was not aligned correctly | next the shower fitting was loose and the upper part came away from the wall on the second day | the shower hose was not fit for purpose and really needed a proper hose, as a result it would kink and cut off | sadly when in use the shower drain is slow and also due to the issue with the door resulted in excess water on the floor | this was reported to the staff for them to rectify on my departure | obviously this guest house does not have air conditioning, but with the toilet door open (so that the extractor fan was working) and the window open the room was cool enough during the day | the room was partially serviced on the first day, but that was my fault | the bedding was not changed, but on arrival it was clean | the towels were changed each day | whilst the bin was emptied on the third day, a new liner was not inserted | the breakfast room is also in the basement | sadly i only used it once, as i prefer a cooked breakfast | however, there was plenty for a continental breakfast | the car park is very small, with room for about five cars and during this stay there was what looked like an abandoned vehicle at the end (but as it is almost unaccessible makes no difference) | access is also quite difficult | on street parking has restrictions, hereford road monday to friday 10:00 to 11:00 and 16:00 to 17:00 | a parking permit can be obtained, if required, for which there is a small daily fee (about 3) | i managed to use the car park each week day, at the weekend parked on the street, so no parking permit was requred | there is free (unsecure) wifi, which was very good | acton main line rail and underground station is a 5 minute walk | instead i used acton central tfl overground, which is a 10 minute walk, thus avoiding the oyster card zone 1 charge | there is a sainsburys local nearby | sadly i could not find any restaurants | i would certainly stay here again'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''great hotel. a clean comfy room (love the soft pillows and duvet). the extras in the room made you feel welcome - yummy jelly babies! also the room had all the things you did not pack - hair dryer, toiletries, iron plus board,padded hangers - well thought out. the staff were friendly and efficient - we were able to check in early without prior notice, taxis were quickly organised, breakfast was delicious and service friendly but discrete. a lovely stay and great base for our london weekend.'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i had an absolutely terrific stay at the corinthia from start to finish. here is what i loved: | - my room (430) had great style, was very spacious, and a fantastic bathroom with the best hotel shower i have ever enjoyed. it is a rainforest shower head that is built into the ceiling. delightful. | - perfect for business travelers: they have a wall of plugs that include 110v so that you do not need to bring an adapter, laptop plug-ins, etc. breakfast starts at 6 am for early risers. | - service was absolutely outstanding- example: i walked in from a long cab ride and flight and the person who checked me in noticed i was green and immediately summoned a glass of water with lemon. very friendly too. | -location is in the heart of london a 2 minute walk from trafalgar square. | - two good restaurants and the continental breakfast (included in my rate) was delicious!! amazing fresh fruit, local yoghurts, smoked salmon, fresh bread. truly a great way to begin the day. the room that it is served in is lovely. | - very quiet. room 430 | in sum if this stays within my budget i will stay here every time i am in london.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''most affordable accommodation in central london tends to be impersonal chain hotels. the rhodes is anything but impersonal; a friendly welcome when we arrived, willingness to carry our luggage to the room (and down again after our stay), attentive service at breakfast. the location of this hotel is excellent, being three minutes walk from paddington main line and tube stations and many bus routes, with many reasonably priced restaurants also nearby; while it is situated on a tree-lined avenue and set back from the road which minimises traffic noise. the only negative is one we were warned about on the website: there is no lift. we were allocated a fourth-floor room (although they did attempt to find us an alternative, without success) which would be problematic for anyone who found stairs difficult. the room was small but adequate, the bathroom minuscule, but everything clean and well-cared for. they are currently replacing the dated floral-patterned carpets with wooden floors, which is an improvement.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''i have stayed at the hotel may times and always find the staff friendly and willing to help if need be. the rooms are very comfortable and the room service is always on time and the food beautifully presented. the choice of films and music available in the rooms is brilliant with a wide choice for all ages and tastes. all the extras included in the room (choccies and jo malone toiletries etc) make the stay even more luxurious!! i am looking forward to my next visit soon.''',2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''we enjoyed everything about this hotel but specialy the kidness of the staff. we got an upgrade for celabrating our anniversary and the room was comfartable and romantic! the breakfast was very rich and in a good atmosfire.the location is a bit for from the center but there are good tube options.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at the rembrandt hotel on saturday 9th february and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. the hotel cannot be faulted in terms of its location, literally minutes from south kensington tube station and less than 10 mins walk to harrods. we arrived early @ 12 noon but our room was ready and we found the staff both pleasant and very helpful. | our room was v.nice, lovely comfortable queen size bed and nice and clean. only slight downside was that the bathroom was a bit small, it was basically a shower room. having said it was perfectly adequate and the shower was nice and hot. | good breakfast in the morning, would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''loved the location close to restaurants and theatre and the tate. food was excellent but you really paid through the nose for it (over 50 for a small light lunch). loved having the cinema on site (saw the martian). staff very friendly and very helpful - customer service very good. hated the art work in the room looked like an extracted tooth - not mondrian at all. marble shower floor a bit slippy. building work going on around was a bit intrusive on week days.''',2
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,'''discreet and faultless service every time. lovely touches in the room during a recent birthday stay and the car is always very well taken care of. we are frequent visitors to 45 and it is always our hotel of choice (our only criticism being that every time reception ask whether it is our first stay!). you cannot beat a pre-dinner cocktail in the bar and there is a great evening buzz at the weekend.''',2
The Dorchester,"'''we visited for a weekend to celebrate my 18th birthday and the stay was nothing short of amazing. we were looked after fantastically and it was a hugely memorable weekend. | the hotel kindly laid on special touches for my birthday which included a bottle of champagne and a delicious and beautifully presented birthday cake. the christmas tree in the lobby was stunning, as were the decorations in the promenade which made breakfast even more special. the breakfasts were enormous and cooked to perfection. the staff were so obliging and seemed like nothing was too much trouble. the gingerbread model of the hotel in the lobby is a feat of engineering! | would definitely return!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''only in india have i received the person attention i received at the savoy. the low key, but exceptional interest the staff had for my comfort and well being was beyond compare. our butler, simon, was on top of every request and nothing was too trivial for his detailed concern. this is the gold standard that should be met by any establishment that cares to hold itself to a standard of excellence. while i mention simon by name, this is not to slight the others who stood by using my name with personal regard and respect. an unforgettable week in a great city.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''very expensive to stay for one night. but wow! what a wonderful experience. | wife and i stayed at the savoy for her 40th birthday! it was a surprise and we were also seeing a west end show. from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we received top quality from all the staff.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i have nothing but praise for this hotel. the owners are on site and the staff are wonderful, so friendly and helpful. ok, the rooms are not large, but you expect that in london, and these rooms are spotlessly clean. the location is excellent with buses almost at the door - kings cross, euston and st.pancras mainline stations are 10 minutes away, and russell st.tube goes direct to heathrow. it is a short walk to the british museum, and a little bit further to the main shopping strip, oxford st. goodge st tube is 5 minutes away, as are the many and varied restaurants of fitzrovia. i found this hotel on the tripadvisor website and was swayed by the good reports from others - so glad that they were true!'''",2

The Savoy,"'''we had our wedding meal in the d'oyly carte room as arranged by the wonderful tanya at ramsay group and then stayed the night in a standard room. even though it was standard the service and room were far from standard. everything was amazing, the attention to detail to making you feel special is second to none. the only thing we found annoying was the fact reception were so keen to get hold of us they left a note under the door at 2am, then rang at 8am and again at 9am. they wanted to get us to pay for a redbull that was on the bill. that is something that could have waited until we checked out. plus the cleaners kept knocking but i think we did not put the do not disturb sign out on the handle so that could have been our fault. | but that said it is still a most amazing hotel, staff are amazing and the breakfast in the restaurant the next morning was fantastic.'''",2

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i stayed for 8 nights in june 2011. hotel selected on the basis of tripadvisor reviews. for the price - ukp48 a night including feb -- this a truly excellent value for the centre of london. i had a small room on the top floor -- all i needed as an older, solo travelling visiting family in london. the shower and toilet on the landing were always clean and free nearly all the time. toiletries are not suppled (other than a small cake of soap) but there is a boots the chemist and supermarket a short walk away in tottenham court road. | two 'boris bike' stands are within a block of the hotel -- convenient if you are into boris biking, which i was. goodge st station (northern line, charing cross branch) is a short walk away on tottenham court road. it is about a 20 minute walk to st pancras international and euston if you are catching the piccadilly line from heathrow or in eurostar. one evening i walked with family into piccadilly circus -- did not take long. | the room has triple glazing -- modern double glazing over the original window so there is no street noise. i think i heard a police car once, but that is it. one slight downside is it is not air-conditioned and does get rather stuffy on a warm day. a small fan is supplied and this helps, but i slept with no bed-coverings each night all the same. the bed was comfortable. | it is a fair hike up the stairs. this did not bother me but i noticed a couple who described them selves as elderly regulars mentioned they now find the stairs a trial. but hey -- if you want a lift get a regular london room and pay ukp200 a night! | the full english breakfast was a treat. served in the spotless dining room in the basement by exceptionally friendly staff who could not be more helpful or pleasant. it is cereal, then bacon and eggs alternating daily with baked beans, sausage or friend tomato. juice, coffee, and toast/marmalade too. i was always asked if i would like a second rack of toast -- which i did. | i asked at the office about a local coin laundry was was told 'nina' would put a load of washing through for ukp5. excellent -- it was ready and folded when i got back in the evening. | there is a pc with internet in the ground floor lounge, and coffee and drinks too. wifi is available and i got a good signal on the top floor. | this family-run hotel is wonderful. if i return to london i would certainly stay there again.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''i was taken here by a family member to celebrate their graduation, i only went to the cocktail bar, but i was blown away. there are not enough stars to allocate to the atmosphere, and for me art-deco never ages (i love art-deco) the cocktails were superb, the staff attentive and friendly. this is definitey a place to dress up for. there is no need to make any comment as to value for money. you pay for what you get. a great place to meet before a night out in theater land. using this as a yard stick the savoy is truely an ambassador of all that is best about the uk.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i recently stayed at the ridgemount hotel in bloomsbury london. i was forewarned that london hotels are small and cramped, but found the ridgemount reasonably roomy. our room had a double bed and 3 single beds as i was traveling with my husband and 2 teenage grandsons. the hotel is only 2 blocks from the british museum allowing us to walk there with ease. it is close to buses and trains allowing us to commute further afield. although we had to share a bathroom, this was never an issue as there were 2 separate toilets and 2 separate bathing areas. we had ease of access to coffee making facilities and were able to use their computers to remain in contact with loved ones in australia. breakfasts were amazing with friendly wait staff serving who could not do enough for us. breakfast consisted of cereal, juice, tea or coffee, bacon, eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes, beans and toast. our host and hostess were friendly and very helpful, particularly as we had problems with a hire car and needed to stay an extra night without notification. we were able to keep our luggage in the communal room until our car was collected. if you are looking for a economical, friendly place to stay when in london, and do not mind sharing a bathroom, then i can recommend the ridgemount hotel. remember that parking is an issue in london and this hotel may not have parking facilities.'''",2

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''could not be happier with the result of booking apex for our london wedding. we came from australia to get married and started the process of organising the group booking around 18 months in advance. we had excellent communication at all times and were offered excellent rooms and prices. | on arrival, the venue did not disappoint. service was impeccable and the rooms were brilliant. we were even offered an upgrade given we had a number of people staying as part of our group. | the location in the financial district was perfect as the wedding was at coq d'argent just around the corner, however if you want to be in the thick of the action on the weekends, this is not the most lively place to be. during the week, this area is pumping but given this is the business area of london, it is very quiet on weekends and most of the restaurants and cafes nearby are closed. we knew this is advance and it was no problem. you are only a short cab or tube/taxi from the action. | highly recommended for anyone looking to stay in london. 5 stars!!!!'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed here for one night at the beginning of december in a mandarin room. room was very spacious and nicely appointed. we were right on the front, next to the flags and the double glazing was sufficient enough for the road noise not to because any disturbance. | service in their bar was excellent with an asian gentlemen (apologies i have forgotten his name) showing everyone how it was done, excellent service, please commend him. | we also used their house car to take us to dinner on the friday night (brand new bentley flying spur), a nice touch. | the hotel is having refurbishment work done but it is done in such a way that it does not disturb you. | my only critique is that i expected a larger bathroom at the price point (1,000 per night). | we will return.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''in any location other than central london, this hotel would have been rated somewhat lower as expensive for its small rooms and dated furnishings. but in central london - opposite the british museum, university of london and charlotte street - this hotel is a really good value proposition with very friendly and knowledgeable hosts, personally cooked breakfast. take one of the buses at the stop nearby and enjoy exciting london views from the top level even if the weather happens to be rainy as during my visit.'''",2
London Guest House,"'''i found all the staff to be very friendly and polite. | my room was a single room and my initial thoughts was that it would be how i imagine the size of a prison cell to be. i had a feeling of claustrophobia on arrival but soon got used to it. | my room was very clean with everything that i needed and all in full working order. | my was impressed with my ensuite, which was also very modern and clean. | i did however find my matress to be a little on the thin side and a little ""lumpy"" | my room was 104 which was downstairs from the reception and right near the breakfast room. | i found my stay to be very peaceful with no noise from any of the other guests to disturb me. | breakfast was a little on the disappointing side if i am honest as i like a full english when i am away from home, and only a continental was on offer. | amongst the items on offer was cold baked beans (microwave provided) | and hard croissants/brioche (which was fine once they had been through the toaster) | all in all i found my stay a very pleasant experience (for london accommodation) and i would certainly return to this establishment in the future!'''",2

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''i have stayed here a few times, london wall and seething lane locations, staff are always super helpful and friendly! they really try and make your stay comfortable and hassle-free! room was very clean and bed/pillows extremely comfortable. rooms can be on the small side unless you go for the upgrade which are much better and you get full free standing bath also as well as a large rainforest style shower so no faffing about with shower curtains etc which is a bit of a first world problem but i really like that! location of the london wall hotel is great during the week for business, right bang in middle of the city but i like it at weekends as well cos its a 5 min walk to bank tube station which has loads of accessibility across london and then there is no noise at night cos you are just outside the hustle and bustle at weekends! actually a stroll around the city at the weekend is great as you really get to appreciate the buildings and history when its not crowded! st paul's is a 10 minute walk away so maybe start there.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my wife and i stayed for 1 night on a trip to london for a event at the o2 arena. the staff were really professional and friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them; although we stayed in a standard room, it had everything we needed and was really comfortable and well equipped. | the gym was good for a city hotel and the spa area was really tranquil and very well equipped, with the staff being very attentive and professional. | even though we were not able to use the rumpus bar on the rooftop, the 'bell captain' took the trouble to take us on a brief trip to the bar, even though it was closed - what a fabulous location to enjoy a drink with the views over the river and central london. | we will definitely be recommending it to friends and staying there again.'''",2

The Lanesborough,"'''the lanesborough is quite possibly the most understated hotel in london. as it is located right at the corner of hyde park where traffic just passes by, most people do not seem to notice its existence. we stayed in a senior suite there for 5 nights and were really impressed with everything: our room was clean and comfortable, and the staff friendly and professional. we would be happy to return again.'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we recently returned from london after staying 5 flawless nights at the corinthia london. after staying at many high end hotels/resorts on previous vacations, (ritz carlton, four seasons, jumeirah, st. regis) i can without a doubt say the corinthia london was the nicest hotel we have ever had the privilege of being a guest. | it started with our luxurious jaguar sedan that picked us up at the airport and avoided most of the rush hour traffic. our driver was professional and quite knowledgeable when it came to touristy questions. | next, we checked in quite early as our red eye flight from the states came in around 6 am. typically most hotels will not allow a check in until later in the afternoon. to our surprise, our junior suite was ready the moment we walked into the hotel lobby. after a long flight such as ours, there is nothing better than having the room ready for a quick recovery nap before hitting the sites. | as for the room - there was a separate sitting area with ample seating, a desk, flat screen tv, mini bar and fridge. the bedroom itself was quite spacious giving us plenty of room for our suitcases and other belongings. the gargantuan flat screen tv came equipped with all the cable channels one could want. we even had a gorgeous balcony overlooking the courtyard. what truly set this room over the top was the bathroom. the corinithia pays meticulous attention to detail as evidenced by the heated floor, dual head (one of which being a rain head) over-sized shower, spa like soaking tub, the largest tv i have seen in a bathroom, and exquisite marble flooring and counter tops. also it should be noted that the interior designers who assembled the furniture, picked out the colors, designed the layout should be commended; it was tasteful, functional and everything we enjoy in a five star hotel (is it possible to give the corinithia 6 stars?). | another nice detail was the housekeeping service. when leaving our room we turned the ""make up room"" switch on and presumably the staff is notified electronically that we are leaving and would like service. every time we left the room and came back they always had the room cleaned and ready for us. their turn down presentation was also a treat, we definitely enjoyed seeing what surprises awaited us each evening! | regarding the service, specifically the concierge: months up until to arrival i had the pleasure of working with max and his team. not once did they fall through on a request or question i asked them. while their service was stellar via e-mails prior to our arrival, their in person service transcended any of our expectations. they knew us by name, knew our itinerary almost better than we did, consistently inquired how each meal/tour was and insisted they do everything possible to ensure our holiday was one to remember. one example of how they achieved such a feat was a brief conversation we had with them regarding one of our meals at locanda locatelli where the service at the restaurant was anything but praiseworthy. when we mentioned our disappointment to one of the concierge team members (i wish i remembered his name but it escapes me), the look on his face (and the two others who were happening to listen in) was that of being mortified. they were so upset we did not have a fantastic meal and informed us they would be phoning the restaurant to speak with management and figure out why were were mistreated. we told them, it was not a huge deal and it did not ruin our night, we just wanted to let them know it was not a place we would return. but again, they insisted they follow up with the restaurant. max's team went out of their way time and time again and instances like these illustrate their consummate professionalism. many many kudos to the concierge team! | as for the rest of the hotel - the common spaces, bars, restaurant and gym were all immaculate and well maintained. we were too busy to take advantage of the spa but we did manage one quick work out session in the gym which had state of the art machines and had everything one needs when trying to get an excellent workout in on vacation. | in sum, i cannot thank corinithia enough for making our london holiday truly magical. we simply have one request, perhaps they could open a corinthia hotel in america somewhere?'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''the reception is opened 24/7, which is very good if your plan has a delay and you arrive at 11pm. the receptionist was more than nice and welcomed us with a glas of prosecco. the room we had was super spacious and clean. apex london wall is my go to hotel from now on!'''",2

The Savoy,"'''we stayed at the savoy as a treat on a sunday with one of the deals. we wished we had arrived earlier to make the most of the experience. it is a wonderful hotel and we had one of our best ever meals there at the riverside restaurant. i was surprised it was actually quite quiet. i had the swimming pool to myself entirely and the restaurant was quiet too. the room itself was lovely with large bed, great art, leather savoy accessories and art deco features. i was a bit surprised at there not being any coffee maker. as we went to sleep i was also a but surprised to see the wall and frame of the picture was really dusty across the front. but that is the only negative. i loved it. i think my husband enjoyed it less because of the pomp and ceremony and he is much more scruffy than i am. i would do it again in a heart beat.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''my son and i stayed for some time at the rhodes hotel in london during our recent holiday to the uk. i did not really know what to expect but we were warmly welcomed and made to feel like family during our stay. chris is larger than life and maria is a beautiful person. we felt truly at home during our total of more than two weeks overall at the rhodes. it is at a very convenient location near both paddington and lancaster gate tube stations. the beds are very comfortable which is much appreciated after a full day touring around london, and many of the bathrooms are wonderful. chris and maria have gone out of their way to ensure that the hotel has good, clean, and comfortable accommodation for visitors to london. i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to all my friends and relations wanting to stay a while in london, and i fully intend to return. thank you chris and maria.'''",2

(although no toothbrush for forgetful me!). it was more a large room than a suite if i am honest however. | the disappointment came when my friends dietary requirements could been able to be catered for - she had a choice of one meal at the restaurant and had fruit and toast for breakfast. she is lacto-vegetarian (and had emailed them twice for a heads up) - very surprised they failed here, definately not what you would expect. the package including a 3 course meal in effect meant in fact had a choice of one main so not worth booking on a package basis in my opinion if you are particular with your diet. also it does not state on the website that you onlt actually get 35 credit each towards the fixed menu - again not mentioned in the numerous emails i sent. | on a positive, staff are very friendly and our butler was very helpful - escorted us to a table at the american bar which had a wonderful ambience and would definately return. the staff are professional, attentive and very approachable. | rooms are pricey (keep an eye on the website as they change daily), but it is an beautiful place with bursting with luxury and timeless decor.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''recently stayed at the sea containers/ mondrian on the southbank on a visit to london- | a lovely hotel, front desk staff were welcoming and friendly- could not do enough attitude and not over the top either! | we had a basic room- very nicely finished, good facilities- | we arrived and our room was not ready so headed to the bar and sat outside on the thames path having cocktails, watched the river and the world going buy! | at night when we came back at about 11.30, we thought we would pop up to the rumpus room for a cocktail. as guests we got entry, but there was a queue, but we were allowed to pass that. | inside it was like a night club and not what we expected, huge queue for the bar and no where to sit, music was pumping out. not what we expected although an amazing venue if this was what you were heading out for. | ended up with a high cap in the quieter ground floor den- great little spot! | all in all a fantastic luxury hotel just 10 mins in a taxi from the west end- will be going back!'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''got a great deal on a room - executive double for the saturday evening! breakfast included. the room was beautiful with excellent toiletries by malin &amp; goetz. would stay again in a heartbeat but only on a deal. the dcor is very trendy, up to the minute. we were on the 12th floor (same as the rumpus room but we did not have time to visit the bar). you would never know there was a thumping bar near our room. we could not hear any noise or anything. had a lovely city view - of the walkie talkie building amongst others. staff were fantastic - just the right level of casual helpfulness but happy to provide any help you need. the only thing that did put a bit of a dampner was the minibar. it was pretty expensive even by bar terms. we did not use any of them as we had a party to go on to and needed to save the cash (!) | still, it was well worth staying there and we have recommended it to all of our friends. if you like spa experiences, it is also a nice place to go. they only have a sauna i think my husband said, no steam room but it was lovely! no refreshments here though either unless you wanted to pay 4 for a cup of tea (really?) | we had lunch in the restaurant though (again on a special october deal) and 3 courses for 25 including a glass of prosecco was very popular with pretty much everyone we saw taking part. the food was delightfully presented, fair sized portions and delicious.....particularly the pear tart. mmmmm! the staff were again wonderful, particularly the fantastic carla. we saw them all again for breakfast the next morning and seriously, i have travelled extensively and i have never had a breakfast buffet like it.....with even poached eggs cooked to order! we are seriously thinking of staying here again just to have the breakfast (you will not need to eat for the rest of the day!) | if you do stay, ask for a room away from the elevators. it is not the hotel's fault but at 1am, 2am, 3am that saturday night and 6am and 7am sunday morning, i was continually woken by people basically shouting in the corridor. what is it with some ""guests?"" do they not get it? people are trying to sleep. just because they have left their room to head off and do something else, does not mean they have to shout and laugh all night long? ridiculous! | perhaps the hotel could think about putting a subtle and polite sign for guests to see when they exit the elevator? just a reminder to be courteous and quiet for other guests. it is a shame - and like i said, not the hotel's fault but basically some people just are way too unaware for their own good. | stay here if you have the chance!'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''the hotel staff were very friendly and the hotel was in very good shape. the breakfast was included every day of our stay and did not disappoint. buffet style and unlimited ( very very very good coffee). you get a free samsung phone in every room, with unlimited data and calling to take and use on the trip. the shower is top notch-- water pressure on par with a fire hose ( just the way i like it). | the downside -- no ice machine or ice buckets. 2017 and no ice machine ?.. you must go to the ""1606 bar lounge"" to get pint glasses of ice. also, we had a card on file ( a working credit card) but were called down to settle a bill midway through the trip. we had to present the card and pay 150 to take the balance to zero. apparently, this is an unkown policy that is not mentioned-- also kind of kills the idea of leaving a card to be charged. | all in all, the location, service, food and decor are quite good. i would definitely stay here again while in london.'''",2

Rhodes Hotel,"'''i was a little worried when we arrived as the entrance area is a little shabby to say the least. but the rooms are clean and well looked after. the staff were very friendly, and the host mr chris could not have done anymore to please. he really seemed to care that everybody was happy, and went out of his way a number of times to please. the room was a little small but that is london for you, everything was in the room and if we needed anything all we had to do was ask. when i go to london i will stay at the rhodes hotel. great location close to lancaster gate tube. continental breakfast was plentiful. english breakfast available for extra charge.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''we had visited the savoy for drinks a few times and loved it - this was our first overnight stay..... | we had read some negative reviews on this site about snobby staff and poor service, so were actually prepared to be a bit disappointed, but thought we had to try it, just once..... | we are not celebrities, multi millionaires, or landed gentry. | we are an ordinary hard working english couple who occasionaly like to treat ourselves, and well..........................we had the most wonderful time!! | we enjoyed the ""sunday at the savoy"" package - 300 +vat for a stunning edwardian room full of lovely treats, a wonderful dinner in the river restaurant, and a leisurely full english breakfast at 10.30am the next day in the thames foyer. | we were greeted by the jolly doormen, followed by mira who dealt with our registration with super friendly efficiency. we were hours early, so we left the bags, went on a river cruise, and at 12.45pm we got a call telling us the room was ready. | the room was gorgeous, and after unpacking, we spent the afternoon in tranquility around the rooftop pool which we had to ourselves. the river restaurant was very busy when we arrived at 7.30pm, but we were led to a river view table and enjoyed two hours of exquisite, discreet, and really friendly service. we quickly finished off the delicious tray of breads and our waiter urged us to have another tray - how could we refuse! the food was all delicious, and the wine was excellent and affordable. | after dinner we sashayed to the american bar (beaufort closed on sundays) for drinks, cards, and a pianist singing lounge classics - wonderful. | we fully expored the memorabilia around the entrance to the american bar with the original index cards for hotel guests like coco chanel and marlene dietrich - how marvellous to be able to see that miss dietrich required 12 pink roses and a bottle of chilled dom perignon in her river view room, and a glass of champagne put in her hand as she walked through the entrance! | fantastic!! | after a long lie in on the fluffy clouds they have for beds, we packed and headed downstairs, where our bags were whisked away and we ""checked out"", before enjoying the delights of the full english breakfast in the serenity of the thames foyer - again fabulous friendly service and made to feel like royalty. | we could not finish all the muffins and danish pastries, so asked if we could take them for a picnic on the train home - they were packed into trays in a flash - no problem. | we then left the hotel to do some shopping, and asked the doorman to add our picnic to our stored luggage - he remembered our room number!! incredible really......... | all the staff knew our names, and gemma in the beaufort bar (which we visited a few nights earlier) even remembered us from our last visit in april. | so if any ordinary, decent, reasonable, non starry people are considering booking a stay in the savoy - | do it!!!!! we,re already planning our next trip...........'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we were here for a wedding and truly had no idea what to expect (that was another story, i am only covering the room and experience - wedding was even more amazing), but from the moment you walk in - it is the detail that grab your conscious and subconscious attention. it starts with the staff who are professional, but seem to know just the level of friendliness and engagement you are looking for. next is the opulent, and modern lobby with the chandelier of individual white lights and one perfectly placed red one. the various open spaces, shopping, and drinking/dining areas were similar. detailed beauty and experience focused. | the next surprise was the room. the hallways were beautiful with a mix of wood floors and carpet, the doors were solid wood with all trim perfectly placed. the construction obviously used craftsmen - no sloppy joints or filler. some that takes a minute to realize - what is different. your eyes say, just walls, doors and trim...but your brain says this is different, luxurious, and special. | the standard room was massive on european standards with a perfect lay out. large bedroom with fresh walls, modern technology, focus on comfort - yet blended in with the history of the building. the separate dressing area also had fine finishes, a nice window, and plenty of space for two. the bathroom was perfectly designed for an array of relaxation - separate spacious bath with a window, shower with fixtures i want to take home, dual shower for rain or spray and a segmented toilet area. all with heated floors makes you want to sleep there. | it almost goes without saying, but worth a note that the bed, mattress, pillows, and lindens were extravagant, comfortable, and led to blissful sleeping - i know it was a wedding so the second day we would have slept on the bathroom floor, but the night before was a good test. | i can only say this is a must stay place at some point in your travels. oh yeah...good location, although we loved the hotel so much we really never left. | thank you corinthia. we love your home, family, and hospitality!'''",2

The Dorchester,"'''we stayed at the dorchester just over last weekend and overall had a thoroughly enjoyable experience. we booked a room via the the dorchester's own website at a fairly competitive rate considering we would be staying at one of the best hotels in london. | firstly, the room was light , beautifully furnished but a little on the small side and with an amazing bathroom (nearly the same size as the room!). it had a 'mayfair' view however looked out, rather boringly, onto the buildings opposite. | us brits like our tea and coffee making facilities in hotel rooms and we were surprised that there were none here, as room service always usually takes up to 30 mins. we telephoned and asked for the above to be delivered in order that we could make our own and this was not a problem - we were advised this would be complimentary. however on collecting our bill a 25.00 charge had been added. we queried this and the amount was then removed. we really would expect a 5 star british hotel to provide these facilities, even if guests did not want to use them and call room service instead. | | dinner at the grill room was excellent from a food and service perspective, one thing about this hotel is that the staff are all exceptionally polite and unstuffy. one glitch that spoilt out dining experience a little was that our table for two was rather close to the next, unfortunately with a rather loud lady next door who was obviously not staying at the hotel and totally in awe of that fact that she was dining at the dorchester! we did inform restaurant staff of this the next day who were apologetic. | after dinner we sat at the promenade and listened to the pianist and double-bass playing down near the bar area. it would be good if the hotel had a residents lounge area or designated part of the promenade as a 'resident only' as i did object a little having to wait to be seated at the promenade. | just before we went down to breakfast the next morning i happened to lose an earing in the room and had to move the bed. i think housekeeping need to check and hoover underneath their beds more often as it was dusty and there were old luggage labels, hairgrips there which showed it had not been cleaned for sometime. going back to breakfast! it was definitely one of the best english breakfasts we have ever had in any hotel. | obviously the hotel is very central and only a 15 minute walk to harrods. we decided, last minute, to go in and see buckingham palace, which was well worth the visit and i would highly recommend it to anyone visiting london this summer. concierge can issue a voucher for this tour however you still have to queue to redeem the voucher for the tickets at the palace.'''",2

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this place is a small family run place, and you will not get a designer bathroom or (for some rooms) a bathroom at all. but for what it is i thought it was excellent. it is a lovely georgian house, and my single ensuite room was spacious - i have paid considerably more for much smaller rooms in central london. there also seemed to be a subtle attention to detail: the bathroom was well designed, the shower was decent, everything worked, the windows opened, the bed was comfortable. oh and everything was very clean. the service was excellent - cheery, efficient and helpful; for example, i asked for some cold water as (being a hot day) the taps were both running warm and they filled my water bottle with not just cold but chilled water. i would definitely recommend this place, and come back myself. be warned gower street is noisy, but the heavy windows block a lot of the noise.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we booked in at the mondrian for sunday and monday night . on arrival the staff were attentive , relaxed and lovely . our room was a balcony riverside room which was a large corner suite ,spectacular and beautifully clean , it has a room with table and four chairs for dining also with a sofa and tv , then the bedroom with tv , very comfy king size bed . both of these rooms have a balcony with seating and table, the view was spectacular . there was a separate toilet off the living area and also a beautiful bathroom with free standing bath , rainfall shower and separate toilet all immaculately clean. there were tea and coffee making facilities and bar , loads of hanging space and drawers , dressing gowns and slippers .we had a lovely surprise in the room of a bottle of prosecco and macaroons which were delicious . | we found ourselves spending most of our time on the balcony just watching the world go by , the activity on the river was intriguing . | the hotel is beautifully presented and all the staff were very professional , friendly and knowledgeable . it seems to be frequented by mainly young professional people and the public areas and bars over the evenings were very busy. | we have had a lovely couple of days , very relaxing . next time and there will be one , we will stay longer and make more use of the facilities ......... the spa sounds perfect and roof top bar which we totally missed is apparently a must ! | thank you to everyone for a lovely stay'''",2

Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we had no trouble deciding to stay at the ridgemount. after reading some rave reviews, we were sold. it also fit quite nicely into our very tight budget. | | it was very easy to find once we figured out the tube and a very quick walk from the goodge street tube stop. the area is fantastic. so many restaurants in the area, lots of people walking around, but the street itself (gower street) is very quiet. there are lots of apartment looking hotels all lined up next to each other. | | unfortunately, i do not remember names, but a very nice man greeted us when we got there and showed us to our room on the second floor. i have only two complaints about our entire stay there. the room was really small. and by really, i mean it was worse than my freshman dorm room in college (pictures attached). thankfully, we are young and spent little to no time there, but for anyone that wants to spend more than an hour of awake time in the room, you will all be sitting on the bed because there is no other space in the room. the second complaint which ties closely to this one is that during our entire stay, there was a study abroad group that was living in the hotel. this posed as a problem if we ever were in the hotel for awake time, the lounge was always packed with college students. i would definitely recommend checking with the hotel before you go if a college study abroad group is going to be there. they were a very respectful bunch and not loud, but we never got to use the lounge because it was always packed. | | on the plus side, the staff was incredible. everyone was amazingly nice and we got a great english breakfast every single morning. eggs, toast, english bacon, and then something different every day. there was cereal, coffee, tea and it was all done with wait staff. this was an amazing part of our stay to have breakfast every morning before we trekked out. the hotel itself is also nice and clean, as were the bathrooms. there was a bathroom in our room which was also small, but doable and nice not to share with all the college kids. the location was perfect. if anything, i would totally recommend finding a hotel in that area. it was so quiet, but around the corner there was tons to do and so close to downtown london. | | honestly, we probably would not stay there again because the rooms were just soooo small for what we paid and we got the double room! i have received more space from a shared hostel room. we were not there that often, but when we were and just wanted to relax, we both had to sit on the bed. if i did stay there again, it would be for the staff and the location. | '''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''have been several times in this hotel, and finally i want to give my opinion about it. | location for visit london is just perfect ( only 5 minutes walk far from south kensington tube station), 5 minutes far from harrods and surrounded by any kind of shops including minimarkets. | hotel staff is always professional and committed to the customers. rooms are way bigger compared to many other 4 star hotels in london (and in more than 20 years visiting london i have been in many of them), comfortable and always properly cleaned, breakfast is just lovely (mini muffins are just wonderful). price quality ratio is very very high even though somebody could find it a bit pricey !! i recommend it for a romantic week end, for a business trip and also for a family trip.'''",2
The Lanesborough,'''an impressive 5 goes to the library bar and the hostess fleurie - she was a dream and made the visit out of this world | she discovered it was my father in law 70th and within minutes there was mini cake and happy birthday plate - excellent service | our cocktails were also fun and beautifully presented''',2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''the location of the hotel is great, within 3 minutes walking distance from the undground station ""bank"". the rooms are big enough, clean, quiet and nicely furnished. the service at the reception was excellent, since we arrived a few hours before check in they stored our luggage and showed us everything we needed to know on a map. i would definitely book there again.'''",2

The Rembrandt,'''the hotel is in a very well placed hotel. the staff are exceptional. they are so friendly and helpful. nothing is too much for them. our room was spacious and exceptionally clean. the bed was very large and comfortable. the room was also very quiet and air-conditioned. we had a lovely breakfast each day and both bar and restaurant meals. all the food was well cooked and beautifully presented. i cannot fault this hotelin any way. i hope to return there when we return to london. a big thank you to all the staff.''',2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''just spent weekend in this hotel, staff excellent throughout, restaurant at sea containers really good with great atmosphere the other two bars were just as good. hotel has great location over looking the thames, plenty to see and do within a short walking distance. really modern boutique hotel.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''travelers looking for a great hotel that is centrally locared, provides outstanding service and quality in everything they deliver (food, room service, concierge assistance, etc.) have to stay at the savoy. having tried other 4 and 5 star hotels in london, we came back to the savoy for first class accomodations and service. working with concierge jaime for theatre and dinner reservations was a pleasure and somehow he was always able to meet our needs. | if travelling, do yourself a favor and stay at the savoy. by the way, try tea in the foyer, it is a memorable experience'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''earlier this year i stayed at the al qasr, dubai, part of the madinat jumeirah group, a hotel i would recommend to anyone and have reviewed twice now. that is what i think is a 5 star hotel delivering 5 star service and comfort. until this weekend i had not stayed at a hotel in england delivering the same. but upon recommendation from my brother in law, we picked the corinthia situated very close to the centre of london and the west end. we could arrive and check in at any time, and also do the same for check out. nothing seemed to be a problem with any of the staff. we chose a deluxe room, which has a small foyer as you enter, a large dressing and clothes area directly in front of you, a superb bathroom with a tv on the bath wall to your left and a lovely bedroom to the right. the room is complimented with lovely fittings and fixtures, a cracking nespresso coffee/ tea machine, huge bed and tv. we ate in the northall restaurant. it was easy to book up and we were taken through to the restaurant which is large, airy, looked beautiful and clean and the service was fantastic, first class. we had a pre theatre menu which was 30 inc champagne, i cannot understand how the hotel can make money out of it. it was a choice of three starters, mains and desserts yet all were excellent size and superbly presented. i would also like to thank fabrizio and his colleague for their wonderful service. we also had breakfast which was included in our weekend package, something i would recommend. the food for breakfast was also of a very high quality, no corners cut, and service excellent again. | if you get a chance, try the espa spa out. i do not think you will find a better one and better facilities in the uk. this really is a 5 star hotel offering 5 star comfort and service! will definitely be going again'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''the xenia is a boutique in a renovated older building. it is well located and the staff is very helpful. there are many restaurants nearby and public transit is easily accessible. | but, the room i was assigned was very small. while i did not miss anything it was strange to find the tray with the water boiler on a lower shelf under the hanging clothes. the windows were not renovated and outside noise could be heard. the breakfast buffet was very good. | i found it expensive for what it offered'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the rhodes hotel rates a ""4"" on a sliding scale. anywhere else in the world it rates a ""3"", but affordable hotels are hard to find in london. the rhodes has an excellent location just 2 blocks from paddington station &amp; tube, and close to lancaster gate tube stop. the rooms are very small, but typical of london accommodations. however the air conditioning was a big plus during a hot spell! continental breakfast was fine: we never paid the extra for the full english breakfast. | service was a little spotty. we had some excellent service, especially from chris &amp; maria who went out of their way to be helpful, even going so far as to drop our fellow travelers off at a restaurant. others working at the hotel were less helpful and not consistently friendly. | overall though it gets 4 stars because of great location, the owners helpfulness, and air conditioning during a heat wave!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''visited the dandelyan bar for birthday drinks with my husband and two friends. had an amazing evening - the views across the river are to die for, and the cocktails are not bad either! the cocktail menu has recently been revamped, and i can say i approve! staff were great, and even brought a birthday cake for my husband. amazing bar, going again next weekend!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''a 4 night stay with the wife (left the kids in chicago with grandma!) on vacation- exec king set us back $3500 (room, tax, service only). full breakfast included, thanks to american express fh&amp;r program. reasonably spacious room toward the back (read: quiet) of the hotel- two closets in the entry foyer- spacious bathroom with his/her sinks, separate bath and shower. there was also a bidet that provided us with at least several minutes of amusement. | the dorch is on the east end of hyde park, across park lane. it is a brisk 5 minute walk to hp since you cannot directly cross park lane (unless you have a death wish) unless you walk south to the pedestrian underpass. green park and hyde park tube stops are closest, both about 5 min walk from hotel. | otherwise, there is not much immediately around the dorch- 5 min walk to shepard's market (a small, socioeconomically normal enclave in the middle of an otherwise outrageously posh mayfair neighborhood) or oxford st and a hideously barricaded us embassy (do not get me started). kensington (harrods, etc) is a good 12-15 min walk- but at least you can cut through hyde park and the lovely flower gardens along the southeast edge. | had tea at the dorch- $135/two people. it is unbelievable to me that the english, who readily voice their disdain for loud, tactless americans, allow constantly ringing cellphones during tea! shockingly inappropriate, if you ask this ugly american. | meals in general at the d are ridiculously expensive, especially given the overall mediocre quality. we did not eat in the grill or china tang- unbelievably pricey. given the multitude of superb restaurants in london, we pretty much limited ourselves to breakfast. | the clientele are an interesting mixture of arabs, tourists, and englishmen wearing tophats (royal ascot horse races were happening). we were low-key americans doing the usual tourist thing in jeans and casual clothing- we definitely stuck out but i did not feel particularly ostracized. no one ever hassled us, except when we tried to unsuccesfully cut through the back door of the hotel as a ""shortcut."" my bad. | service is fine- not outstanding though. calls to the concierge desk in the middle of the day went unanswered a few times. maid service was excellent- discrete, fast, and thorough. check in and check out went fine- they got the bill right on the first try pretty much. overall, service is comparable to ritz carlton, four seasons, but not as good as peninsula. | summary: although the location is considered great, i would suggest that the dorch is actually a little bit off the beaten path, particularly if you like being able to easily walk (within 5-7 minutes) to restaurants, lounges, shopping, etc. it is outrageously expensive but i am hard-pressed to say it was really worth spending so much for what we hoped would be the quintessential english experience, especially with the constantly ringing cellphones during breakfast and tea. i would stay elsewhere if we went back. | p.s. selfridges is far superior to harrods- less tourists and waaaaayyy less emphasis on their own brand. for example, if you want to buy tea at harrods, you can really only buy harrods brand. if you go to selfridges though, you will have a ton of choices, only one of which is the selfridges brand. selfridges' foodhall is just as impressive as harrods. similarly, selfridges also has an amazing array of clothing, electronics, books, etc. skip harrods- selfridges is a much more entertaining and productive shopping experience with way fewer people to push through.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i booked this hotel after seeing the interior pictures and falling in love with the theme. it is even better once you see it! great studio with amazing decor and the most comfortable desk chair ever! aside of how beautiful the hotel looks, the stars of this hotel are a reflection of how attentive, smart, funny and competent the staff is! from reception ( renato) to the italian waiter from sicily at lunch time at the restaurant, what a great place to recommend and visit again! | the location is perfect for an early stroll by the river, what a treat! | dear mondrian staff thank you for a great stay and welcome! as for londinium...well simply one of the main hubs for culture, variety of people and finest landscape of old and new!! enjoy everyone! | you see it l'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,'''we had a saturday night stay as a birthday treat. we got a great room with a view east along the river. the furnishings are luxurious but contemporary. the staff are attentive but do not overwhelm you. we had an excellent dinner in the massimo restaurant which had a buzzy atmosphere. i would recommend corinthia if you are looking for a well located london 5 star that offers something a little more modern than the traditional park lane &amp; mayfair hotels.''',2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we have just returned from a 2 night stay with our children. we booked, through another site, a double and a triple room as that was what was available and then i e-mailed the hotel directly to request that the rooms be next to each other. they responded promptly and, on arrival, we not only had rooms next to each other but they were a triple and a family room, leaving us with a fantastic amount of space. the rooms were clean and really warm, in fact we ended up using the air conditioning to cool them down, with all the stated facilities. all the staff were really friendly and carried our bags down to the room on arrival. there was plenty of choice at breakfast, we did not try the cooked breakfast which was available at a small cost. the location is excellent with both paddington &amp; lancaster gate tube stations within easy walking distance. we really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be staying again.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i recently stayed here for at least the fifth time. i have stayed in both single and twin rooms, both with and without private bath, and all are very comfortable and a great value. for my recent 10-day stay i had a single en suite. although the room was small, it was perfectly adequate. it was located at the rear of the hotel with a nice view of the garden and an unexpected treat: lots of birds singing every morning. you cannot beat the location on a relatively quiet street. with at least three tube stations (serving five different lines) in easy walking distance and a bus stop right across the street, you can get just about anywhere in central london in a few minutes. check out the ethnic restaurants in nearby charlotte st. and the vegetarian indian ones in drummond.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i stayed at rhodes hotel over two separate periods for a total of 4 nights in late january / early february 2014. | there are two separate buildings and i had the pleasure of staying in both. the rooms were fantastic - very up to date fixtures, fittings and appliances and very comfortable bedding. | breakfast was lovely and served with a smile. | all the staff were kind and very helpful. | my only comment, is that there are a lot of stairs in the main building, so if you are not so good on stairs (or you have just come back from an 11 day tour with the flu) you may wish to ask for a room on the lower levels. otherwise, the exercise going up and down the stairs will do you no harm! the staff assisted me with carrying my bags which was very kind of them. | i look forward to staying at rhodes hotel next time i am in london and have passed the name on to my friends.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we live in london, but sometimes treat ourselves to a night out... my partner had heard of a new kid on the block which might rival the great and the good of the old guard. namely the ritz, the savoy and the dorchester....so i booked... | i had heard of the refurbishment and was shocked at the sea of marble, the pillars, the cavernous interiors in which could house a king (where is the recession? certinaly not in london) oh boy the owners must have deep pockets.. | our room was not ready (even after 4pm) and we were asked to have tea in the lounge....and the general manager would come out...he never came out....and they charged us for the tea..(perhaps he was more interested in the new x factor winners that were staying) eventually a lovely lady took us up to a wonderful suite overlooking the river thames (just)...our room was very blue and art-deco..although it was more designer than functional, and very art gallery (quite cold), although the butler service was delightful.. too many little bits..books etc..the gm needs to visit the savoy and see how it is done... | we had planned to go out for dinner but decided to go to massimo..the buzz was amazing and the food was as well...we gorged on so much sea food...i commented to my partner ""that this could be the best fish restaurant in london""... (sorry scotts you have some serious competition).. | room service breakfast was a must and was faultless....they even rung us to get us prepared for their arrival....although where was the salt and pepper? | if your going to visit our wonderful city.. stay somewhere else until they get it perfect...although try northall or massimo's because they are up there with the great and good already... | we are londoners and are wiery of the the new kids on our shores..i am sure if they sort out their check-in and their general attention then they will be up there with the rest.. stay again we will see..dine in the restaurants yes'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''a beautiful hotel. our deluxe room was extremely spacious, noise free, and richly furnished, with an abundance of storage space, lovely products and a very comfortable large bed. staff were courteous, helpful and efficient throughout. location is good and the promenade/foyer is such a delightful space for breakfast, afternoon tea or a drink or two. no pool though there is a spa. definitely one of londons' best.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed overnight in this hotel as a birthday treat for my hubbie. spectacular view from the window &amp; very modern decor. the hotel was very clean &amp; only opened 2 years ago. the room was spacious &amp; lots of nice features like a 'handy' which is like a mobile phone but preloaded with closeby things to do. you can take this with you on your trips out of the hotel &amp; return it to the charging cradle in your room when you return. the beds were very comfy and amazing mini-bar, but needed a mortgage to use it! the price list included the clock from the room at 30, pillow at 45, duvet at 200 &amp; bedding at 260 should you decide to take them with you when you leave! bathroom was clean &amp; well stocked, but we were a bit disappointed that we were in a disabled room with high loo, low wash basin &amp; wet room without being asked on check-in. we were lucky to get a good deal through secret escapes which included breakfast (otherwise 25 per head) &amp; sat outside watching the world go by while enjoying our breakfast. lots of choices of good quality &amp; well cooked food. would definitely recommend the hotel for a trip to the south bank. oxo tower, the globe, national theatre, tate modern &amp; lots of restaurants very close.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we just spent two nights at this wonderful hotel. the staff were wonderful and the hotel is convenientally located if you want to walk to harrods, harvey nichols. hyde park is a stone's throw away and we enjoyed a leisurely walk dfrom the hotel through the parks and onto buckingham place. | the buffet breakfast was outstanding and offered a great variety of food.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''really enjoyed the rembrandt. excellent location/neighborhood for a london base. across street from victoria and albert museum and just down the road from harrod's and hyde park. great dining options in every direction, especially next to south kensington tube stop. hotel rooms are stylish with newer furnishings and small but well appointed bathrooms. staff was extremely helpful with bags, directions, and making reservations for us. the hotel is afilliated with the aquilla health and fitness club next door. while not included in room cost, discounted access available and it is quite nice with a beautiful pool, sauna, and workout area. also various spa services. each room has a smartphone made available for use for local calls, navigation, and web browsing which we thought was a great touch. the included breakfast buffet was a god bit above the average for any hotel. near harrod's, there is a section/neighborhood with a predominate middle eastern/mediterranean population well worth exploring. the restaurants/bakeries/drinking establishments were very good, unique, and so friendly. walking through there in the evening was quite unique for us with menus and hookah bars and language that were very colorful. definitely try one of the delicious pastry shops. easy tube distance to all the faves of london visitors. recommended.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''a great hotel in a good location, 5 minutes walk to liverpool st station. the room was lovely and the amenities were top quality. clean, comfortable, though a little stuffy (the heating was on despite it being july and we could not quite figure the air-con). the staff are fantastic and i would highly reccommend that you stop searching &amp; just book this hotel! note that on a weekend, the surrounding area closes up, so very few open shops, restaurants etc - but that goes for most of the city area on a weekend.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i stay in hotels around 4 nights every week (of every standard from 3*-5*)- i am generally not that easily impressed however the corinthia blew me away!! | every details from arrival through to departure (each at a time to suit you, not the hotel's housekeeping department) was perfect. | the staff are friendly and make you feel comfortable and at home - unusual for a 5* in london, rooms are amazing and the espa spa stunning. | it is not (and should not be) the cheapest option but i can guarantee if you stay here you will not be dissapointed. i will be staying whenever i can!!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''i stayed at the hotel following a conference in london. from the moment you step through the famous doors of this hotel you are met with the highest quality of service, nothing is too much trouble, the rooms are a good size (for london hotel rooms) and beautifully appointed. this hotel is definitely not cheap but what an amazing experience. we ate in the savoy grill which offered wonderful food and high standards of service and had cocktails in the american bar which was fun. we will be staying again soon.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''once again i was visiting my father who had decided to try the savoy when having to suddenly his trip and found that a change in hotels was not a bad idea.. the suite was a little smaller than the one at the ritz and instead of a view of the green park, we had a view of the thames albeit at a distance.. i tried both restaurants and nice meals which i shall review separately.. however in my opinion while the refurbishment has done a lot to improve the restaurants, bar and lobby there is much to be desired in the rooms.. however on another note the staff were extremely polite and in terms of service right from the checkin there is nothing left to be desired..'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we had a nice room, and it is a good location, with friendly staff. we especially liked johnny, who is part of the breakfast team. the check-in staff did a very nice job as well. the concierge told us of a fine restaurant within walking distance. the food at the hotel is very good.'''",2
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''i stayed at 45 park lane for a few days late may, on a recommendation from a colleague. the experience was faultless. i booked a park view studio, which turned out to be a spacious room with a large functional desk, generous lounge area, king bed and large bathroom. the room looked out to hyde park, leading to a very pleasant view of green trees and blue sky when the blinds were raised every morning. the furnishings were modern and classy, with a lot of wood tones. the bathroom included twin wash basins, with separate bath and shower. the room service menu is extensive and arrives in your room remarkably quickly. i did not have an opportunity to try the restaurant but the bar is excellent. i was arriving from heathrow very early in the morning so booked my room for the previous evening to ensure it was available when i checked in. a nice surprise when i got to my room, was the basket of bakery items waiting for me, with freshly squeezed orange juice. the most striking thing about this hotel, however, is the outstanding service. the staff are young and good looking in their black uniforms, and are very well trained. i lost track of the number of times i was greeted by my name. this hotel is a gem, and i would recommend it to anyone.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we stayed one week at the ridgemount in march and were delighted with the hotel. great value for the money. the owners have made wise decisions to keep the price of rooms affordable, by the standards of central london. (clients cannot expect to have everything for that price ...!) what you get for your money are competent and experienced staff, congenial owners who go to great lengths to accomodate the reasonable needs and requests of their guests, clean rooms and bathrooms, a copious breakfast -- the perfect start to a day of sightseeing ! -- and of course a very good location in the heart of bloomsbury, within walking distance of the west end theatres and close to underground and bus lines. to keep prices affordable, the owners have chosen not to update the decor and fabrics, and there are no telephones in the rooms. (calling from a hotel room is prohibitively expensive, in any case !) but these are minor sacrifices to make. my wife, daughter, and i could not possibly have been happier with a hotel in that price range, and the hotel (and its owners) were a crucial part of our enjoyable stay in london. we would recommend the hotel to anyone and hope to stay there again.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my hubby booked us a weekend here for my birthday and wow can be the only headline i can think of. firstly we got to the hotel and the valet was outside and ready to take our car away for parking, thank you hamish! when we got into what was a very modern, contemporary but beautiful reception we were told the hotel had given us a free upgrade to a superier patio room as a treat for my birthday. this patio room, has a little private patio, with table and chairs and ashtray for the smokers. if you are a smoker you know what i mean when i say this is a total joy to get in a hotel anywhere in the world! to say we were chuffed would be an understatement. this hotel is only a year or so old, it sits directly on the south bank, right next to the oxo tower and the itv studios, in the middle of all the action you could want. the rooms are modern but have all amenities you could possibly want. i have to mention the wifi, for us country bumpkins sometimes only getting -1 on our broadband, we were wetting ourselves with getting nearly 50 at the hotel, oh you lucky pips in london! | anyway onto the room again, there was not anything we would wish for any more than this hotel, its situation is perfect, right in walking distance for all attractions. we walked to see the poppies which were amazing, and once we had finished walking we realised we did 18 miles in one day. totally enjoyed it. | we did try to get into the dungeons however a tip for anyone looking to go, book in advance, we could not get in as it was fully booked for the day, it was disappointing. so we decided to queue up for 50 mins to get into the london aquarium which is next door to the dungeons, once we finally got to the counter to pay, it was just shy of 50 for both of us, and if i am being totally honest, it was not in the slightest bit worth it. we have been to much better aquariums around the world, and expected a whole lot more from the london aquarium. but if you are determined to go, book in advance and take advantage of the deal of all 4 attractions for a set price to all, ie. madam tussores, aquarium, dungeons and i think the last one was the tower, but i could be wrong with that one! | back to the hotel, i could not recommend this hotel enough if you want a top class hotel, right on the south bank, but with a more relaxed atmosphere than the stuffy traditional hotels in london. | we will definitely not go anywhere else when we go next to london, as you can see from the excitement of my post we really had a smashing time there.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''as a huge fan of art deco i was particularly looking forward to my stay at the savoy. whilst the hotel itself is stunning, the service is variable somewhat disappointing considering its reputation. as ultimately its service which differentiates a good from a great hotel, i do not feel id hurry back. more detail... | arrival | arriving into london city, id booked the savoys limousine transfer service (135 pounds for mercedes s-class) hoping for a speedy transfer to the hotel. having provided my flight details it was disappointing having to wait 20 minutes before the chauffeur arrived (with an a4 page with my name hastily scribbled on it). the vehicle was not as booked. the arrival at the hotel was lacklustre typically with a well-organised hotel transfer you are greeted by name on arrival not the case at the savoy. having been asked my name, and a delay of about 5 minutes whilst the paperwork was located, in room check-in occurred. i would however note, upon discussing the issues with matt at the front-desk he was apologetic, providing a complementary transfer on departure and pre-dinner drinks very well handled! still, from experience id just recommend booking an independent transfer and save yourself around 50 pounds. | | the room | the deluxe art deco room was spacious, luxurious, and tastefully furnished with a partial view of the london eye (see photos). whilst on the whole well maintained, there was damage to the bedside cabinet and the wardrobe door hinges had fully detached. notably there were no tea and coffee making facilities (a pity given my welcome tea ordered at check-in time had never arrived). housekeeping was poor with no turndown service on the first evening, late afternoon servicing on the second day, and turndown for two when there was only one guest. | public areas, bars &amp; restaurant | all very well appointed. | thames foyer afternoon tea was very enjoyable; the service was however, with the exception of one staff member (a dutch gentlemen), inattentive. still, its a must do if you are in residence. | bars the beaufort offered very good cocktails (patience recommended if you enjoy gin), had a great selection of champagnes, and nice ambiance (overall my favourite when compared to the american bar). service was good. of note however, is that even as a resident the only seating option available on a number of visits was at the bar. | river restaurant an enjoyable dinner but not exceptional; limited options for vegetarian dinners.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my husband and i stayed at the mondrian overnight last saturday to celebrate his 40th birthday and go to a party. before arriving i had been contacted and asked if it was a special occasion, and i also booked 2 mud packs in the spa. on looking at this again it was clear that the mud packs were in separate male female hot rooms, and when i contacted them about this they arranged for us to be in the same room. we also arrived earlier than check in which i had informed the hotel about before. so all in all communication before arriving was helpful and responsive, and indicative of things to come. | we drove and when we arrived valet parking was on offer, which we declined - it was 45 pounds, and we dropped our stuff and drove 2 minutes down the road - and parked ourselves for 20 pounds. if you do go for valet parking just be aware that there as some very close car parks that are significantly cheaper! | check in was fine - but when we arrived in the room i realised i had mistakenly booked a room with 2 double beds in rather than 1 king size. no problem - the porter encouraged us to ring reception and they found another room for us, which they would make ready and move our belongings when we were in the spa. | we picked our keys up, and the porter moved our bags into a lovely room. 2 minutes later a knock at the door and we were delivered a cake to celebrate the birthday - a really lovely touch. | we went upstairs to the rumpus room (which i had booked) for a drink before we went out, and whilst this was not cheap a special treat to look out over the view and spoil ourselves a bit! | breakfast is a buffet with a wide selection of hot and cold breakfast food - we asked for fried and poached eggs that were brought to the table, but i do not remember it being obvious that you could ask for this. so do if you do not want scrambled eggs. | the room was spacious, the bathroom excellent and the staff (all staff - porters/receptionists/supervisor (who sorted my room mistake out - i have forgotten her name) were superb - nothing was too much trouble. overall this was very good value for where it is for a five star hotel in my opinion. i would definitely recommend it and definitely go back!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''wow!!!!! what an amazing experience. | we were brought this as a first wedding anniversary present and we will certainly never forget it. | it is 5 star treatment. | we have been to dubai and had afternoon tea at the burj al arab 7 star hotel and this beats it hands down! | i cannot have mayonnaise so our waiter had sandwiches made especially for me that were fine to eat. | my husband went to pour his own tea and was quickly told that that is their job and we just needed to make sure they were there and anything was not too much!! | the waiters were so friendly, were very polite and professional but had lovely sense of humour, appropriate for this kind of establishment. they asked questions about your visit, not too intrusive but as interested as if you were their only customer. | the food was exceptional. that is all i am going to post...try it for yourself!!!!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''returned from a friday night stay at the hotel with a friend of mine who was celebrating her birthday. i advised the hotel prior to our arrival that is was my friends birthday and what a lovely surprise first of all for the reception staff to acknowledge this on arrival and also when we got into our room to find a lovely birthday cake waiting for her. we were in a deluxe bedroom which was just luxurious. one thing we did notice was that they were no tea/coffee facilities in the room however that was such a small thing it really did not make any difference to us. the room was wonderful, very spacious, glorious big bathroom just wonderful. everything was spotless. | the whole evening of having drinks and canapes to dinner was just lovely. i could not fault a single thing. the staff were extremely friendly and more than helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. | the breakfast next day in the pavilion was a delight, we were brought a basket of pastries which was more than enough, although the eggs benedict i ordered was also so delicious. | would 100% love to return to the hotel and i would certainly recommend it to my friends and family.'''",2
The Savoy,'''quality was excellent. a real touch of class. the savoy really sets the standards for hotels. i will be back here again. great location. | the doorman are so friendly and professional. there are some really nice restaurants and bars in the hotel too so no need to really leave the hotel.''',2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''gower street, heading south, becomes bloomsbury street, endell street, bow street, wellington street, lancaster place, and then waterloo bridge. an almost straight shot to the south bank, and right alongside theatre district. meantime, back north, very near the british museum. as i write, the ridgemount is rated #62 in london, but most of those above it are hundreds of dollars per night, several over one thousand. so at fifty-seven to seventy pounds, $114 to $140 in round numbers, this is a treasure for those ultimately paying in us dollars (pounds at the desk, of course). beyond value, the ridgemount is family run and apparently owned by good employers: the entire staff is cheery and helpful, from breakfast to room cleaning. make no mistake: this is a very basic hotel with small and stark rooms barely helped by the lounge with internet connection (wireless too) and the typical english breakfast. but for location and value, there is no comparison.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we stayed at the ridgemount for 5 days recently. it was difficult for us to choose a neighborhood of london in which to stay. this hotel fit our needs perfectly. the bus stop was just outside, and the tube a few blocks away. we could walk to the theater district and the british museum. it was very nice to have a daily breakfast included in the room rate. of our stays in venice, bologna, and london, this was our cheapest accommodation. if you are on a budget but still want a nice, clean room and great staff service, you cannot go wrong with the ridgemount.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed here on a honeymoon break and was very impressed with the hotel and the staff. from check-in the staff are more than friendly and helpful, they will literally bend over backwards for you. after telling checkin staff that we were on our honeymoon we were greeted by a complimentary bottle of prosecco on ice which was a very nice gesture. the hotel had 3 bars and every one was amazing, the dandlyan i beleive has recently one awards for the best new bar in the uk.. aswell as their bartender winning best barman in the uk... i think! the hotel and room were outstanding. a large open lobby area beside reception with huge sculptures and cleverly designed curved wall cladding, looked amazing. the room designed by tom dixon i believe was full of art and bespoke furniture and fittings. even the lighting system added a level of class! could not fault this hotel at all and have recommended to many friends for future visits. location wise was a treat too. 5 min walk from blackfriars station which has regular trains to gatwick, and 10 mins walk to major attractions, the eye/dungeons/shreks adventure.'''",2
A To Z Hotel,'''the hotel is in a very nice and quiet area. transport in area is quite good. the room is small but ok. wi-fi only in the lobby or in the breakfast room. the personal was friendly. the prices are good for the service you receive.''',2
The Savoy,"'''mum and dad used to live in london many years ago, when they were first married (early 60s) and dad would take her to the savoy on very special occasions for a cocktail...after they moved back to scotland, they often spoke about it and he always promised to book a special trip for them when he retired but unfortunately dad passed and it never happened and even now at the age of 80 mum would still sometimes talk about it.. so to keep the promise that dad made, i decided to take her back and this our experience of mums stay in the london savoy. | i had been trying to arrange a trip to the savoy hotel for mums birthday and because of her age (nearly 81) her health and mobility, i was very aware that it would have to be this year but unfortunately the package i wanted was no longer available and i was so disappointed, but in stepped the savoys own in-house angel- quality executive and sustainability manager, ms debra patterson. | this lovely lady was completely outstanding and could not do enough to assist me in arranging this special trip for mumthere was nothing she would not /could not assist with. she arranged our theatre tickets on my behalf before we arrived, booked a fabulous table for afternoon tea for us and even arranged a table in the american bar for a cocktail for after our theatre visit . this fantastic lady answered all my (very numerous and i do mean numerous) emails and enquiries so promptly i felt like i was the only customer in the worldeverything was so seamlessly arranged and mum could not wait to arrive, neither of us aware of just how special this visit would be. | and so the fun begins . | we arrived by train from scotland and jumped in a black cab. the lovely taxi driver - who, incidentally, we found out in through our conversation, lived only a few houses away from mums brother until my uncle and aunt decided to retire to the coast a few years ago. in a city the size of london -how incredible is that! anyway, he drove us to the savoy advising that there is only one way to enter the savoy in order to get the full effect. to be honest, i had not really thought about that but as the savoy is set back from the strand in its own little private road it made sense you cannot really get the full wow factor of the incredible art deco entrance unless you enter head on from the small street straight across the stand and i never thought i would say this, but we were lucky enough to get stopped at the traffic lights - giving us time to take in the amazing sight of the savoy entrance. the savoy, with its glittering statue of peter of savoy in all his glory standing atop the roll royce frontage surrounded by fluttering flags is a sight to behold, truly iconic in every sense of the word a hotel with an unparalleled history, amazing tales of the rich and famous (and maybe, the not so rich and famous) that must have been played out over the years in this one small part of london the stories it could tell! | we arrived a little while before 3pm (official check in time) and were immediately assisted by the very welcoming and beautifully attired staff at the main entrance - helping mum from the taxi, organising our overnight bags and escorting us into what i think must be the most beautiful hotel foyer in the world - less than 3 minutes at the savoy and mum felt like a duchess. | my first impression. was simply wow. mums whispered first comment to the concierge as he help her from the taxi was i have waited over 50 years for this! this wonderful person smiled and quietly whispered back it does not matter how long it takes you to come back were here waiting for you! i could have cried- what a wonderful thing to say. | the rich, dark wood, original revolving doors, gleaming black and white floors, sumptuous rugs and sofas surrounded by stunning bronzes and beautiful porcelain wall friezes at ceiling height- the more you look the more you see. in fact, everywhere there is something else to drag you into a world that i now know, can only be the savoy. | we were introduced by the concierge to the lovely reception staff, shown to a grand and exquisitely decorated reservation /check-in area, where we invited to have a seat and complete our check-in process. we were being escorted to our reserved twin room when our angel of the savoy appeared and introduced herself we finally meet the lovely person who had been so instrumental in ensuring that the trip could go ahead as planned. i already knew she was extraordinarily helpful but she is also incredibly beautiful and such a lovely lady to talk with she insisted on personally accompanying us to our room, which i thought was such a lovely touch and arriving at the 7th floor, we were met with a beautifully understated but elegant corridor leading to room 754. the door opened and we were completely blown away. | our expected little twin room was, in fact the most beautiful edwardian suite with views over the thames. i have never seen a more stunning hotel suite. the angel had upgraded us to this incredible suite. the same black and white chequered tiles floor as the main foyer welcomed us into a large and out of this world entrance hall, which had a lovely modern twist due to the gorgeous lilac textured walls. a beautifully proportioned sitting room was decorated in a classical edwardian style - comfortable cream sofas, elegant high-backed pale green chairs, dark wood desks and cabinets throughout. simply wonderful. the bedroom was decorated in the same style and again - just breath taking. we were so shocked and completely over the moon- not believing this was ours. we were so in awe of our lovely surroundings - it took quite a few minutes to noticed all the other little extras that debra had arranged a beautiful little birthday cake and card, champagne, chocolates and a delightful bag of the savoys special blend tea. we had been in the hotel less than 15 minutes.and mum, who felt like a duchess before, now felt like a princess our angel gave mum a theatre programme and advised that she has also arranged special access and a dedicated member of theatre staff to assist us. | can a day get any better? | well actually, yes it can and it did. | i had a table booked for mum to enjoy the savoys legendary afternoon teaso after freshening up, changing clothes and enjoying a glass of champagne in our beautiful suite we headed down to the restaurant. this is got to be one of my favourite places in the savoyelegant, beautiful and serene! there really are not enough words to describe how truly lovely it is. | the famous savoy afternoon tea is everything it is reputed to be and so, so much more.the selection of teas is second to none - mum fell instantly in love with the savoys specially blended black vanilla (telling anyone who will listen that this is the best tea in the world!) the selection of finger sandwiches would be hard to beat, but you just must try the smoked salmon with lemon curd cream cheese. odd sounding, yes, i thought so too - but it works on every conceivable taste level possible and the warm fresh baked scones served with clotted cream and fresh strawberry jam were feather light and mouth-watering but the little fancies and cakes were beyond description.little works of art in their own right . the lovely maitred visited every table, offering guests a complimentary glass of champagne, which you could see was very much appreciated and enjoyed, just a little touch but it just helps provide an overview of the incredible standard of customer care and service that the savoy and its fabulous staff provides to each and every guest. the lovely pianist, who added immensely to the overall ambience, even played a few bars of happy birthday for mum, while the staff presented her with another delicious little birthday cake to enjoy. in fact, we could not finish even half the cakes, so our lovely waitress from italy, arranged for them to be boxed up and taken back to our suite for later. (sorry, but you have no idea how much i love writing our suite instead of our room!) | we were just 4 hours into our stay. | after our delicious savoy afternoon tea we decided to have a little breather, return to our suite to relax before going to see dreamgirls. we both just sat looking out the window, relishing in the fabulous view of the city and the thames until, all of a sudden, it was show time. on leaving the hotel we walked about 10 metres to the theatre door and we were met 3 lovely staff and advised by a darling young chap that he would be our assistance for the whole evening, that if we needed anything just let him know. he took us into the small but incredibly beautiful savoy theatre . pointing out the seats that had been specifically reserved for us but also advising that if we felt that they were not suitable then he had other options available. but like everything the savoy does the seats booked were perfect. i do not think there were better seats in the house front row, circle. we were very lucky, not only did we have the fabulous seats, but we ended up chatting with 2 lovely young men sitting next to us, who were so funny, interesting and well acquainted with scotland. they often stay with friends who live not far from usanother amazing coincidence in a city this size! | the show was not what we expected but all the better for that very reason. especially in this stunning and intimate theatre. the acoustics are fabulous, the costumes- dazzling and the story was sad/funny and enthralling all in equal measure. at the end of the show, we were escorted back the main entrance of the hotel where we were welcomed home, asked about our evening etc we felt like everyone was a friend, staff addressed us by name and seem genuinely interested in every single guest. in glasgow, our city motto is people make glasgow . well, this truly applies to the savoy. yes, the hotel is stunningly beautiful, the service is out-standing and the savoy even surpasses its own world famous reputation on every level but the people are the real stars. they truly make you feel like you are the most important guest in the hotel. (and mum, who felt like a princess before had by this point decided she now felt like a queen!) | debra had booked a table for us at the world famous american bar but it had been such a long but wonderful day that mum was exhausted so i felt it was best to take her back upstairs rather than stay and enjoy a cocktail (much to my disappointment) but it was mums birthday treat and she was tired soheyho! mum was straight into bed and asleep in minutes, so i decided to make the most of the massive, luxurious bath and have a soak using the wonderful decadent toiletries - such bliss and so relaxing after our hectic and fabulous day. | and so to bed! into the most wonderful bed i have ever slept in (i never thought any bed could compare to those at the hong kong penninsula, boy, was i wrong. savoy beds feel like you are sleeping on air, they just wrap themselves around you and feel heavenly. in fact, i think it would be nearly impossible not to have a great nights sleep. | next morning myself and the queen made our way down for breakfast. the breakfast menu at kaspers is excellent and a really great way to start the day.. from the aroma of vanilla wafting from the little trays of pastries, to the scent of crushed blueberries in the fresh baked muffins that are offered while you make your breakfast choice right through to the delicious savoy breakfast that we opted for and wonderful rich and aromatic coffee served- there was not a fault to be found. but after our delicious and very leisurely breakfast, we had to head back upstairs to pack and contemplate the journey back to reality. our wonderful stay was nearly at an end and honestly it really was truly, truly wonderful. | in reality, visitors come to london to see the sights (and rightly so, it an amazing, complex and vibrant city) but people stay at savoy to make memories. yes, the savoy maybe a little expensive but it really is worth every single penny. it might be a world-renowned 5* hotel but its much, much moreits a feeling and it just makes people happy. i now totally get the savoy | on the way back home to scotland, mum turned to me and said that she felt dad was with her during our stay, that it might have taken over 50 years to revisit but if she died tomorrow she would die happy. | this gorgeous, charismatic hotel with incredible staff creates memories and experiences that will last a life time!'''",2
The Dorchester,'''we stayed at the dorcherster at the end of may.it is one of the best hotel i have ever stayed in the world the staff are fantastic and very professional. on checkin we were welcomed back as previous guest and promptly upgraded to a suite which was great we were also warmly greeted by the concierge who remembered us from our previous visit. this is a great hotel with great staff the only thing is that the internet is not complimentary like other hotels of this level. | i will most certainlity staying he again when next in london.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this has become my go to hotel in london. it is not a cheap option, but it is worth monitoring for their specials, such as 3 nights for the cost of 2. fantastic location in whitehall just south of trafalgar square. easy access to london eye, houses of parliament, and all that central london has to offer. you can walk everywhere from here. the hotel itself has such a high level of customer focus. the staff are very helpful and seem genuine in their desire for you to have a great experience. the rooms are large for london. very clean and well maintained. i found the bed to be very comfortable and had a great night's sleep. they have a nice lobby area and separate atrium to sit and relax and enjoy afternoon tea. the food in the hotel is very good. i visit london have a dozen times a year and have yet to have a bad experience on any level at this hotel. highly recommended. have not had the time to use the spa, so cannot comment on that part.'''",2
The Savoy,'''very nice stay! pleased with the room and very happy with the staff. lobby bar was great as well.overall condition was great. the only downside was that the road in front of the hotel was quite frustrating with traffic.''',2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''stayed here for the weekend. this was my second visit &amp; will be back again. food in restaurant was delicious and room was very comfortable &amp; clean. staff were very helpful. location is great on the river with so much to do nearby &amp; only a short taxi to most places. highly recommended &amp; will definitely use this as a base for any future london trips.''',2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''stayed for one night whilst attending an event in london. we were upgraded to a fantastic two room suite overlooking the thames. the decor of the hotel and the rooms harks back to the historical maritime nature of the buildings previous occupants. really nicely done. we did not eat dinner in the hotel but had room service when we came back. have to say that the burgers we ordered were super-pricey but the best we have ever tasted and served quickly with extremely polite service. overall fantastic service from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out. loved it and we will definitely go back. pity there is no pool but that is the only slight downside.''',2
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''i recently stayed at 45 park lane for 1 night whilst down in london on business. i have stayed at 45pl many times for work and with my family and see it as my home away from home when in london. in my experience, each stay gets better than the last. | in terms of the hard product the rooms are easily the best in london. each room or suite has a great view, feels spacious and has a stunning well appointed bathroom. as always, the pre-arrival communications were great and handled in an incredibly efficient manner by raul. raul organised a couple of appointments for me and arranged a table in the bar so i could have some dinner. i am a big believer that what makes the difference in luxury hotels like this is personal service. they meticulously remember all my preferences from previous visits and place the things i requested last time without me having to ask. | f&amp;b is a huge strength at 45. whenever i stay i get to have japanese beef, which, having grown up in japan is a real treat. they make fantastic pancakes for breakfast and the bar does a phenomenal old fashioned cocktail. | housekeeping was perfect (as always) and the whole team were super friendly and looked after me really well. i have just completed a stay in another hotel of a similar standard to 45pl and it really made me appreciate just how hard the team at 45 work and how meticulous they are. i want them to know that it does not go unnoticed! | in closing, go ahead and choose 45 park lane without a single hesitation - it never disappoints.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''it is sometimes not a good idea to go back....but we do....and sometimes and some places never change....but our hearts are weakened by the memories, we have...and our minds are curious...so we go back hoping to pick up where we left off. | there is only one place that i can honestly say leaves me feeling as if it were only yesterday...and the faces are the same...the smile and the embrace...the conversation and the guanine desire to make you feel valued, loved appreciated and welcome...that place is the saturnia international hotel in venice....and venice itself... | so i return as often as i can but if i have a break of a year or two, it is still as i left it. | here though was a moment...and an opportunity to stay in london...and my memories of a time gone by tickled my thoughts, my heart felt a pang of joy....and my head agreed....we shall stay in a particular hotel, one that we had stayed at several times, both as a couple and with our children, we always had a warm welcome and a very nice room, suite, the service was wonderful the room very very nice indeed, the food and hospitality perfect....so all this together with the location, why not return... | so we did, we decided to book direct, which was a good idea, again it was what i always used to do, but bearing in mind the last time we were there was 20 years ago. | since then we have the internet...enough said. | so my first impression was hopeful that maybe my choice was good...the rate was very good, and the room choice offered was fair value....so far it looked promising. | we arrived,,the exterior was as i remembered it, the reservation desk was manned with enough people to make it smooth and very efficient. | the young lady was pleasant and welcoming...even remembering that it was our anniversary and wishing us well and upgrading our room to a club room, !! which i was pleased to hear though i asked what was the difference between the excecutive room and the club, i said it in a very quiet voice as i did not want to seem ungrateful, the answer was taken away by another member of the team who distracted the young lady from answering, so i left it. | we took our luggage to our room which was on the fourth floor, the lift was smooth and quick, the corridors bright airy, and we approached our room, opened the door, i am not saying it was small but i fell straight out of the window....hee hee ha ha...only joking...got you though...anyway....i opened the door and i was met with a very lovely interior, very nice, very nice indeed, comfortable well dressed and meticulously cared for...the drapes the bed linen the bed covers and the furniture all, very thoughtfully put together, good housekeeping here for sure. | the dressing gowns slippers added a nice thoughtful touch, the bathroom extras were plentiful, right down to the dental kit and razor. no sex toys though...only joking...sorry...as i was saying, there was fruit and water,,a well,stoked fridge and magazines to read, a comfortable couch and table onto which you could place your ice cold beer, and a tv if you want to view, if not a massive king sized bed to loose yourself in, which i did a couple of times that night, it is so big one would have though a gps should be included in the extras. | the sleep though, was glorious, the pillows made sure of that, the mattress was a long big hug, and the room space was enough not to feel hemmed in. | my only complaint at this point is this,,why do the hotel guests who when leaving there rooms at say 6 am or later think, that people are sleeping as such to close their doors mindful,if others, and not let them bang shut, which they did, and by golly they were loud, so to the housekeeper, please might i suggest a door frame noise reduction strip, this will make up for the ignorance of others. | the shower, big enough for two, and the bath too,. | then breakfast, well i do not like serve your self breakfast, all that food left out for who knows how long, and people handling utensils, hands that have wandered far and wide holding the ladle that you are about to handle...yuck! dried skin and hair cascading all around, people of little hygiene leaning over that which you are about to eat...no...not like....so one has to be selective in what one eats....so i chose carefully, but to be fair most hotels offer this method of feeding the masses, that which i could see looked tired and well tossed and turning, i did try a sausage and a piece of bacon, only to find them cold and tough, the eggs were not happy, they looked sad and abandoned, the fruit salad was tinned, the serial, in a far off place embarrassed i think to be near the feeding table, the bread was hard at the edge,mine coffee typical hotel coffee sad, cold strong and suffering in both taste and texture, why cannot hotels make a cup of coffee? | the dining room was laid out with tables too close to each other, the room though large was not at all elegant considering the promise made by the exterior, that is why i could not understand why the hotel dinning offer was so poor, i had hoped to have dinner there on my first night, but the offer was not as i had hoped, and thus decided to eat elsewhere. | the bar was furnished with very comfy chairs and sofas, the staff helpful attentive and always pleasant, the service excellent. | the health suite was next door and though i did not use it, it looked great, if i return i will use it, if i return i want a room overlooking the street, if i return and when i return i want the doors to close with a whisper, and finally, i would like the wine prices to reflect that in the absence of a meaningful dinning experience, there should be a wine to drink that does not require an aged steak to qualify it is price. oh i forgot my room overlooked the central,square of air conditioning units, the sound proofing was good though but imagine...'''",2
The Savoy,"'''stayed in early november, and it was lovely. we were in a suite and the room, decor and view was beautiful. bathroom was large and the room was spottless. the staff was very kind and made us feel very welcome. as this is old world elegance and service, i was happy to see the staff was not stuffy, but very accomodating and relaxed- yet formal enough. a nice balance to experience in a five-star hotel. the american bar was true history, and the staff in the bar took great care of us, and explained the drinks, which was a lot of fun. my only ""complaint"" was the overall value- for the price of the room, though the stay was wonderful- it would have been nice to have included breakfast- even something minimal or some other small amenity. when you are paying so much for a room, those little extras go a long way. however, this is very common in many high end/luxury resorts, so i cannot hold it against the savoy. overall a great stay, and wonderful experience in london.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,'''the location was very good with regard to popular tourist attractions (e.g. covent garden and numerous theatres - the british museum was a mere 10 minute walk away) and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. the room and facilities were very good and clean and the family-run atmosphere made for a very welcoming stay. i would definitely consider re-booking for another trip to london.''',2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''me and a colleague visited the main bar for after work drinks one weekday night last week within the hotel as non-guests and were treated so well. it is such a beautiful hotel, very well designed architecturally. | the staff are so attentive and polite, monika made me a bespoke cocktail taking into consideration my preferences and allergies and was very accommodating throughout, i will definitely return with other colleagues and friends for drinks and dinner. i will also take the hotel into consideration when booking accommodation within london.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''a coworker mentioned the hotel as being really good and conveniently located. it is by american standards an older building in bloomsbury about 2 blockes from the british museum. quite convenient to shopping,theaters and public transportation. rooms and facilities are kept very clean and neat. room was ensuite and well stocked. breakfast was included; juice,tea/coffee, either cold cereal or eggs,bacon,sausage, etc. | owners/staff checked each morning for our destinations and directions (short cuts) as well. friendly helpful environment, with free computer available. | there are no negatives to report.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''as regular visitors to london for work and pleasure we have stayed at many hotels and i have to say this has been the best one yet. the hotel is luxurious and elegant throughout without being old fashioned and overly ornate. for me the aesthetics of the place are as good as it gets. the room was large and comfortable, service was warm, friendly and professional. we particularly enjoyed having drinks in the garden area. the hotel spa was on another level to any other spa i have ever experienced, a great facility and a big plus for the hotel overall. the corinthia is definitely number one on my list for future visits and i would highly recommend to anyone - cannot fault anything.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i recently stayed at rhodes hotel and was genuinely surprised at the qualiy of the rooms (for the inexpensive price) and how friendly the staff were. locations is great for tube (only two or three stops from oxford street), good restaurants within 100/200 meters from hotel. with rooms from 50/60 it is an absolute must!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''nothing could say it more than above and beyond everything was amazing and the team went out of their way to make our stay better than i could of dreamed of. | from the start the staff went out of their way even when we arrived early. | big thank you to the wonderful staff.''',2
The Dorchester,"'''just returned from a one night stay at the dorchester, a retirement treat for my husband and myself, we mentioned this to the very helpful young lady who checked us in. our room was large as was the bathroom, there was complimentary bottled water and fruit also. we spent the evening out some friends, on returning to our room, we discovered a lovely chocolate decorated cake had been left for us, such a nice touch. the bed had been turned down, pyjamas laid out and my untidy pile of clothes folded up. the next morning we asked at breakfast if the cake could be boxed for us to carry, we were told this could be arranged and sure enough when we got back to our room the cake was inside a dorchester carry box. our breakfast was lovely, freshly cooked with lovely breads and pastries. this is not a cheap place to stay and really was a treat for us, but we were impressed with all the staff, the attitude seems to be nothing is too much trouble for a guest. finally, i am not the best sleeper, but have to say our room was quiet, the bed and pillows were so comfortable, it was like sleeping on a cloud. all in all a lovely stay. just as an extra tip there was a comment from another reviewer that the hotel is a fair walk from green park tube station, we got off at hyde park corner which seemed fairly close to the hotel.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''visited mondrian@ sea containers for nye with my boyfriend. it was a beautiful modern ultra clean hotel, and the room was lovely. i think we paid so much for the date (300 odd) - being nye it was a very sort after location. the queue to check in was really quite a wait, but staff were apologetic and very friendly and helpful. again, this may have been due to the date. our room did not have a view and was quite small but the bed was really comfortable and the room was clean and modern. we visited the hotel bar and enjoyed cocktails. each drink served was accompanied by a small glass of water which helps in the morning (no hangover!) and keeps you feeling fresh through the night. we opted to go back to our room around 11pm and ordered food to the room. it came really quite fast and was enjoyable! and not too expensive either! | we unfortunately missed the fireworks as we ended up falling asleep! haha. it was a lovely hotel | however, after visiting shangri-la at the shard i would definitely recommend the shangri-la over the mondrian.'''",2

The Savoy,'''so looking forward to this trip to the savoy with my family we had 3 delux rooms very clean and stunning bath room ate in kaspers very nice used the pool this was wear it went down hill very rude staff in there accused my grand baby of having chicking pox and told us in a in a very nasty manner he is only 6 months old and has got some marks on him from a very bad case of it at christmas wear he was in hospital so there is no way he has it now so this made my daughter cry we left the pool area feeling very angry with the rude ladie she should of at least called us to one side to tell us to in front of 10 people so not sure if i will use again''',2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i stayed at this hotel for one night in december 2012. | i had a single room with shared bathroom and shower. the shared bathroom and shower are in separate rooms which is handy, and you are only sharing with a couple of other rooms so i did not have any problems getting ready in the morning. there is a sink in the room with soap and i had a fresh towel, as well as a hair drier. the only thing to mention, as some other people have, is that there is no shower gel in the shared shower. | the room was simple; single bed with a desk and digital flat screen tv. the bed was comfortable and i did not hear too much noise from the road so it was not difficult to sleep. the location of the hotel seems to be quite quiet anyway, it is far enough away from the nearby main roads with the bars / restaurants. | the staff were very friendly and the breakfast was great - cereal, orange juice, tea/coffee, then sausage, bacon, eggs and toast (freshly cooked and served to your table). | i cannot think of any complaints about this hotel; it is very cheap for what you end up getting - a clean, fresh room with the basic stuff you need for a short stay.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''after the best hotel experience of my life at the savoy in may, i simply had to go back. i would never stay at another hotel for my bi-yearly holidays in london. this experience was somehow even better than my last one. we were graciously greeted and taken to our sublime rooms. they did not have our suite available so instead they gave us two larger connecting rooms which were even lovelier than the suite we had on our last visit. as before the rooms were immaculate, spacious and superbly appointed. i have never slept in a more comfortable, luxurious bed. | the daily breakfasts at kaspar's were perfect and of course, the thames foyer serves the best and most elegant tea in london. even if you are not staying at the savoy, the tea here is not to be missed! | i have to add that the location could not possibly be more perfect. you are next to and across the street from some of london's best theaters. i had the pleasure of seeing jennifer saunders' performance of lady windermere's fan at the vaudville theater which is within walking distance. | ultimately, aside from the beauty of the hotel, what keeps me returning is the impeccable customer service; one truly feels welcomed at this legendary establishment. | i would like to thank everyone at the savoy for yet another memorable stay and look forward to returning soon. | roxana russo'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i was fortunate to stay at the corinthia hotel for three nights over new years 2017. this is a fabulous hotel - although quite compact in size which is a little surprising from the outside. | the rooms are fantastic, amazingly luxurious and well equipped (although an iphone compatible speaker or bluetooth speaker would be a nice touch and was a surprising non-addition). the bathroom was amazing and both the shower and the tub are hard to get out of. | very odd bar system on nye in the main room where you had to pay in advance for drinks in a queue system - as one other guest pointed out, for a hotel of this standard it is odd to have to pay for each round of drinks in advance! | but aside from this, and a slight hiccup we had with servicing our room on time, the hotel is amazing and i highly recommend it. | for nye in london it is perfect!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''a last minute deal which was like winning the lottery. valet parked the car, met on arrival and was told our room had been upgraded....amazing art deco room. friends were staying too, we had a wonderful evening meal. cocktails and a fab breakfast. i have worked in the hotel industry and nothing was too much trouble...everything was spot on, i could not find one fault with the whole stay. definitely would return...it was an amazing treat to stay.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''an excellent base for a weekend in london - quiet in the evening, but not very far to the nearest tube station, and a blissful relief from the hustle and bustle of busier areas. extremely friendly and helpful staff, outstanding. loved the room and the view from the balcony!'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,'''the location of the hotel is excellent as is the facilities both in the public areas and the bedrooms of the hotel | check in is a stress free process and takes only a few minutes before you are escorted to your room. | my only disappointment was the quality of the buffet breakfast. for 34 i would have expected a much better selection and quality of food''',2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we had booked the gourmet package as a treat for our wedding anniversary. | from the moment we reached the front steps we were welcomed, our luggage taken care of , whisked through check in and led to our suite although we had arrived early at 11.30 am everything was ready. the room was a good size and beautifully furnished with large b&amp;o tv and natty ipod docking station slightly out of keeping with the traditional swags and tails decor. the bathroom was large with a lovely selection of coveted jo malone toiletries there was complimentary fruit juice and champagne. when we returned later chocolate strawberries had been delivered which we enjoyed with the champagne | we had booked the package to obtain a table at the exclusive dinner by heston which my husband was desperate to experience and did not disappoint. the menu is based on historic recipes which were quirky and delicious, snail porridge, meat fruit, steak, pork, tipsy cake and chocolate bar all enjoyed and washed down with a nice red wine and tea infusions to finish. | we slept very well, luxury bedding , silent air con and very little noise although we were on the street side facing harvey nichols. | breakfast was another gourmet experience included in our package. each item was individually priced - the waiter advised us that we had an allowance of #36 each ! | we each ordered fruit juice, coffee, a fruit plate and cooked breakfast with one round of toast between us - when the bill came we has over run our allowance by #2.50 that was #75 for breakfast! never mind being scottish we like to get our monies worth and we did not eat anything else all day. we walked it off around buckingham palace state rooms. | well it was an expensive overnight trip but it was absolutely worth it for a special occasion . as reported elsewhere the staff in this hotel look after you so well from beginning to end- we will start saving now for next year'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''my brother booked this hotel and based on these ratings and we were happy with what we got. | we stayed in a twin room for 6 nights, with a shared bathroom with one other room. the twin room backed onto the busy street outside, but as i am a heavy sleeper it did not bother me much. | the bathroom had a seperate toilet, a bath and toilet in one room, and a shower in another. the shower was very small, but functional enough to get the job done. there was not a queue to the shower at all... | the room was small as expected, and a dated as expected, but clean and secure. there was a hand basin, a wardrobe, a set of draws and a desk with the tv sitting on top. the free wifi was a bonus and worked well while we were there. beds were made and the place cleaned each day. | the service, i thought was great. the garden out the back was a good spot for those that have the smoking habit - you just need to get yourself past reception to get there, which was not a problem. the traditional englishman at reception was quite english, and made you feel like you were in london. he seemed mildly interested in what you had been up to. the only downside was that they seemed to want to convert currency via their bank when we settled up - i was thankful that i did not, i would have lost at least au$60 | the english breakfast was fairly traditional and basic - the catered to vegetarians ok - just supplementing with whatever the cooked version was with extra cheese, tomatos etc... all of it was served to you rather than you having to get up. | all in all it was a good place to stay - location was good - service good - id go back...'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''my partner chose this hotel based on the reviews already written so i hope our review will help someone else decide to stay there. check in was friendly and efficient. the room although not a great view as on the first floor was spotless stylish and extremely comfortable. the bathroom was wonderful a lovely big tub and a great powerful shower with very nice toiletries. the room had complimentary goodies but be careful to read the card as the nuts are not complimentary. breakfast was very tasty the full english was lovely however my partner ordered the pancakes with bacon and was disappointed to only get two small pancakes. check out was easy and quick. it is a little bit out of the way and if you find the tube an ordeal then maybe this hotel is not for you, however if you do not mind then you are in the main tourist area within 15 minutes. we loved it here and would happily stay here again. by the way we saw the show spamalot and that is well worth a visit too.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed here recently to attend the alexander mcqueen exhibit at the v &amp; a museum; directly across the street from the rembrandt. i was very happy here. the wealth of museums within walking distance was a dream for me. i am mobility impaired and use a scooter. it can be tricky getting a taxi when they see my scooter, so being able to go across the street and get to these places under my own power is about the best i can hope for. | the hotel itself is very nice. clean, quiet, lovely staff. everyone i talked to or had interaction with was very professional. | breakfast is included, and they will even let you have it as room service (small delivery charge, but i did not mind at all). full english or whatever you desire. room service was good, as was the food. with the exception of the scampi basket. that was not good. the free wi-fi was surprisingly fast. i was impressed that the hotel offered an ethernet connection as well, with instructions and the cable if you wanted to connect to the internet that way. there was also a small but well equipped business center in the lobby. | rooms are a reasonable size for london. well appointed, very comfy bed. the bathroom was quite nice. be careful of the floors. they are lovely black marble which can be treacherous; even with bath mats. tubs are nice deep soaker jacuzzi tubs. | my brother stays here all the time, and is the one who recommended the rembrandt. i am glad he did. it is not one of the grand dames of london hotels, but that is not what i wanted. i wanted a nice, small hotel that is clean, quiet, focused on the guest and most importantly, near the museums. i got exactly what i wanted. i will definitely be back, and will recommend it to anyone going to london who wants the same thing.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''an excellent experience. the staff are efficient, friendly and welcoming. the facilities are first class, the guest wants for nothing, the american bar serves superb cocktails (the secret agent gets my vote). kaspars serves the finest sea food and the staff helped me with my first ever oyster. delicious. while not cheap the savoy offers great value for money. i recommend the hotel highly. lbw'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here as friends were here, arrived and thought uh oh, the room was pleasant, the linens and towels really good quality and plentiful, the bar and food very much above average and overall this place is a bit of a sleeper. the spa and gym next door is really good (small fee) and i have been here 3 nights now and really like it. if you read my reviews you will see that i only comment when my expectations are exceeded or not met, the rembrandt understands its core business... guest comfort.a really good find with lots of fine casual restaurants and cafes in immediate area,try pierinos for great casual italian and cafe valerie for coffee and treats.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''excellent hotel, with extremely friendly service, very accommodating staff. the room was clean, comfortably and nicely furnished. large, clean bathroom. | we stayed at the weekend. the hotel being in a financial district, it was very quiet but not far from lively areas if you want it.'''",2

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''a fantastic hotel. it is a little outside the main drag of london attractions (e.g. buckingham palace, big ben, st. paul's, the tower), but it is only about a 5-minute walk to the tube and a 10-minute ride to the heart of everything. definitely grab a coffee and walk from the property through the neighborhood up to hyde park (just under a mile). | as for the hotel itself, it is extremely well-appointed, the staff was beyond attentive, the wifi is great and the public spaces are superb. the room i had was on the smaller side (i was in there solo and felt a little cramped; i dare say two people would really feel pinched), but that did not diminish the experience at all. i will certainly be back here on my next visit.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i booked the ridgemount after seeing the listing for it in lonely planets 2010 england. i am a student on my way to uni and the price was right for my stay in london. the hotel is in an excellent location, very close to the british museum. the room was small by american standards, but the delightful people who run the hotel more than made up for the size. everyone was so helpful, always curious about where i was going and offering assistance. my favorite was the cheery maid who served me a full english breakfast every morning.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the mondrian sits on the south bank just across from blackfriars tube station and many of london's attractions. the perfect location to walk anywhere while taking in the views. | the lobby, restaurant, dandelyan bar and rumpus room are all superbly appointed. | although super modern and sleek, the maritime heritage is subtly referenced in many areas. | our room on the ninth floor was immaculately clean, very spacious and comfortable. our bathroom had both a walk in shower and a free standing bath. | the service throughout the hotel was great at all times. | cocktails at the dandelyan bar are pricey, but worth it. the view from the balcony of the rumpus room is breathtaking, taking in st. paul and all the other landmarks of the london skyline. | the only minor disappointment came from the restaurant. the menu had room for improvement. our dinner was well presented, but lacked substance and was rather average.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''from entering the lobby, you get the feel of a modern hotel with a good vibe. this pervades the hotel - the rooms are fairly large, modern, clean lines. did not eat at the restaurants, but they are consistently full and people look happy. | well located right on the thames walk in southbank, so london bridge, etc to your right, and big ben, the london eye to the right, and about a 15 minute walk to trafalgar square. | seems pricey, but got a good rate with my company.'''",2

The Dorchester,"'''we stayed in dorchester for four nights.our room was very beautiful,well and classicly (but not old fashionly!) decorated and gave an immediate warm and homy feeling .we came to london to celebrate our 12 year old son birthday and the hotel receptionist received him with a cake , candles and lots of candies and received us with a great champagne bottle.thanks!!!!!room service was efficient and the room was spotless every single day.theatre desk managed to get great tickets to wicked and hair.concierge was very helpful,doormen very nice-offering taxis,umbrellas etc.we did not go to the hotels restaurants but went to the afternoon tea which was wonderful -really getting pampered by the generous staff.well ,despite the fact that the hotel is pricey,it worth it!

The Rembrandt,"'''i had booked a 4 day stay here and when i arrived the duty manager (najib) explained apologetically that there had been a computer glitch and instead of my choice of a classic double room he would unfortunately need to place me in a single room for the night. he went on to say that since the hotel was completely full there was no other choice, however he would upgrade me to a king room the following day. he reduced my first night room rate to help ease the problem. | i accepted the option, really i had no other choice, and true to his word next day i was in a king room. he even sent a gift box of toiletries to my room. | that incident aside the stay was very good. this is a clean hotel with good service and located across the street from the victoria and albert museum and within a short walk to the natural history museum and the royal albert hall. | my sincere thanks to najib for the professional way he handled the computer problem.'''",2

The Dorchester,"'''the dorchester is a classic luxury hotel. the location is terrific, and the service is superb. as is typical for london hotels, the rooms are not huge, although ours was quite comfortable. virtually every other london hotel is cheaper; the dorchester is very expensive, but for a special trip to london this is a great choice.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we have stayed at the rembrandt hotel in london many times and have always found it to be an exceptional experience. the location is extremely convenient, the staff goes out of its way to be caring and attentive, the rooms are very well maintained and appointed, and the full english breakfast is wonderful. we enthusiastically recommend the rembrandt hotel to travelers.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''really impressed with checkin, were a bit let down when coffee machine and kettles were not in the room, the reception let us down telling us they would be sent up, so after an hour we called housekeeping and they brought them up but after 2 calls. we were upgraded as requested but were not advised so that led to an awkward situation at checkout. breakfast was fantastic, but marred by the fact our waitress told us we had to count up the cost of breakfast items when we deliberately chose a b&amp;b rate to avoid this. the hotel is fantastic, rooms are well decorated, the hotel complete with original styled lifts (elevators) is sublime but i felt, (despite being a fairmont club member ) that because i was not wealthy as i imagine the usual guest would be that i missed that velvet touch.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''the savoy london is perfect in every way! from the man in top hat and tails gretting you by name the first time you arrive, to the private, seated check in, to the location on the thames right in the middle of everything. the savoy accomodated our family with adjoining rooms which were large, comfortable and had luxurious marble baths. our reservation included breakfast each day which was outstanding! the afternoon tea put on at the savoy is a special treat. although we did not have reservations and they are definitely needed, the staff worked hard to get us a great table. finally, dinner one night in the gordon ramsey restaurant, the grille, is a treat not to be missed. other than the ritz, i am not sure you can pick a better place to stay in london than the savoy.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''myself and my husband are both in agreement (for once) that this hotel is excellent! modern and with a funky dcor which we like. we booked quite last minute as we got tickets to a show at the itv studios down the road and this was one of the closest hotels that still had availability. so happy that it did, otherwise i do not think we would have ever discovered it! | corinna/carina on reception gave us a massive welcome at check-in and had us in stitches! she offered us a discounted upgrade to a river view deluxe room which we accepted as it was great value for money. she was very informative with what facilities the hotel had to offer and what showings the cinema had on that evening. | lots of staff everywhere at the hotel happy to help but not obtrusive in the slightest. | the upgrade was worth it as we had lovely views over the thames and st paul's cathedral and the room was a good size for the two of us. very comfortable bed and we both had a very good night's sleep with no noise disturbance. | we visited both the dandelyan bar and the rumpus room and loved both of them. it did not feel like we were at our hotel but more like a nice bar/club! great city views from the rumpus room and it had a dj playing decent tunes. both bars had such a buzz to them which made for a good atmosphere. we were asked if we had a table reservation at both of them which we did not but we just stood at the bar at the rumpus room and we managed to get a table that became occupied at the dandelyan. their cocktails prices are in keeping with london hotel prices but the ones i had were small and were not lasting me long, so i switched to the standard vodka + mixer in the end. | breakfast on the sunday morning was served until 11:30am which was great after enjoying the hotel's bars a bit too much the night before. they had a good selection which unfortunately i could not stomach too much of but my husband had a full english breakfast and said everything was so fresh and he really enjoyed it. | overall our stay was fantastic and i wish we had stayed for longer. we are currently looking at staying there for our wedding anniversary this summer as we loved it that much and the area it is in is not too busy which suits us both. hopefully next time we will take time out to use the spa and the cinema!'''",2

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we spent last night in the xenia and could not recommend it more highly. the staff were outstanding. everyone smiled and spoke and made one feel welcome. reception were charming and neil could not have done more. our bedroom was fairly small but very comfortable with all that one could get in a 5 star hotel. our bath plug did not work but maria sorted it straight away. the breakfast was perfect, endless choice, sitting in the sunshine in a conservatory. | it is spotlessly clean and modern and although, for us, it is slightly in the wrong part of london (we go to the theatre a lot) i would definitely stay here again. if you want to feel better, stay here!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''the savoy has an american bar just off the lobby and the drinks are really great. the wait staff are on the ball as well! try the cosmos and you will want more. they serve their drinks with olives and nuts and the olives are to die for. | great wine down spot. most of wines are on lighter side...being from california, i prefer much heavier wines and they had only 1 in that category by the glass (a napa one at a price i could buy the bottle for in the states). | we followed drinks with dinner in the hotel at kaspar's seafood bar &amp; grill. it was a perfect way to follow cocktails from the bar. their brussel sprouts are so good!'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''stopped at the rembrandt for a london weekend with another couple, booking two king executive rooms. we had a great stay at this hotel, lovely room, great breakfast &amp; lovely staff, defiantly stop here again. | it is situated in a good area near the museums, royal albert hall &amp; kensington palace and some very nice restaurants. | a special mention for neil the concierge who was very good, jolly and helpful. if your looking for places to go and see then neil is the guy to ask and he will only be too happy to help or organise for you. | bar prices are a bit excessive but it is what you would expect at this type of hotel, certainly would not stop me returning.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''as one of the best hotels in london, it is only right that the savoy should be judged by the highest standards and our experience was generally excellent but there are a few points to note. | we had a very comfortable room on the side street and as other reviewers have said the noise from outside seemed to penetrate the double glazing from early on a sunday morning. the art deco public rooms were manificent and the staff were welcoming and generally very efficient. | we were part of a large group function and the catering and service were well up to expectations. | disapointments? we arrived after lunch and would not be dining until after 8pm. the only realistic option for a light meal was room service and while this was enjoyable and beautifully presented, i felt it was over priced, as were soft drinks from the mini bar. | | secondly, the american bar was packed to capacity by 11pm and the only alternative was to take to the (admitedly comfortable) restaurant. i got the impression that were a lot of non residents and perhaps space could be found for a dedicated facility for house guests. | breakfast was only adequate and i might have more to say about the ambitious pricing of some very simple items on the menu, had it not been inclusive in our case. | lastly, while check out was very efficient, we gave 15 mins notice of wanting our car (as advised) and waited a further 15 mins before it arrived (ie 30 mins) and even then the bags had not arrived. a lot of guests were leaving but all cars seemed slow to arrive.'''",2
"Bulgari Hotel, London",'''a lovely hotel in a good spot in london. driving there recommended as they have a valet service. customer service perfect and the rooms incredible too. spa treatments pricey but well worth it. plenty of food choices locally too.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we stayed here for one night and it was not enough! the hotel is superb, contemporary but not minimalist. the room was lovely and well equiped. the lighting in the bathroom was great as generally i find there is insufficient light for applying make-up. breakfast was great and the spa is out of this world. i have seen lots of 5 star spas, but this is amazing! the staff were all lovely and the service was without fault. finally, the 24 hour check-in is an innovative idea and is so convenient. we will definately be back on our next trip to london.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''this was our second stay at the savoy, they upgraded us to the next room category, which was wonderful with lots of space and a seating area, where we were able to have tea and cake when we arrived. the view of st paul's and the shard was fantastic, river view room was perfect. the service was great and very efficient, though the lady in the shop was slow and had no idea why we wanted to have cake delivered to the room to eat - something we were told by other staff members we could do.. the only niggle i have, is that since our last stay a couple of years ago the rooms looked a little tired. couple of broken tiles, paint coming off the wood and furniture. for the price of this hotel, i would not expect to see defects such as this, i have been to many other hotels where this was not so obvious, so i was a little annoyed. overall a lovely stay, the cocktail bar was lovely and they acknowledged we were celebrating with a lovely surprise cake. we did not have breakfast here this time, but i highly recommend simpson in the strand for breakfast.'''",2
The Rembrandt,'''booked hotel for my fiances birthday. they sorted out a jacuzzi bath for us and sent up a lovely bottle of wine and fruit platter which was a lovely surprise. staff were very friendly and helpful. breakfast was superb they had everything you could think of. great location only a few mins from the main entrance of south kensington tube station.''',2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i visited the mondrian with two old friends. we wanted somewhere chic and audible! this place is extremely chic, comfortable chairs, fantastic view and an ultra modern design by tom dixon. it is decked out to feel like a gigantic ocean liner and you feel very special as you begin your cruise! it really is a delightful building, housing a hotel, several bars, a restaurant and a 54 seater curzon cinema. it also has the best toilets in london! checkout this place as it is a luxurious treat and a great place to meet. i will definitely be back.'''",2
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''with its landmark architecture and dynamic interiors behind an art deco facade, the hotel is, of course, sophisticated but also very contemporary, hosting us celebrity chef wolfgang puck's ""cut"" restaurant, where you will casually find yourself having breakfast or a delicious steak meal (the chef's specialty) under works from damien hirst's psalm series'. | i was totally in love with my suite, the moment i stepped in: combining contemporary style with art deco elegance, it clearly is one of the coolest hotel rooms i have experienced recently, as it had everything i love... spacious, super stylish with great colour combinations and nice art, beautiful furniture, a super comfortable bed, and a lot of technology. virtually everything in the room could be operated at the touch of a screen, from the blinds to the different sets of lights.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''stayed here for a weekend in february | the stay was faultless. rooms are beautifully appointed, public areas amazingly decorated and the food and bars wonderful | if i had to praise one single thing about the savoy above all else - it would be the service of the staff. i have never experienced such flawless, seamless and ""above and beyond"" service anywhere. | a delightful experience!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''as a family of 4 we took afternoon tea at the savoy. there were two fixed menus, trad or high tea. the latter the same but with poached egg on salmon on a brioche instead of a mix of finger cakes. the finger sandwiches were excellent. the tea cakes fab. the tea just right. customer service is what you would expect of this establishment; attentive, discrete and well mannered. this is a must do. allow 60 per head at 2016 prices and hurry before the nanny state slaps a sugar tax on those lovely cakes!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we came to stay to celebrate our engagement, we had such an enjoyable stay the first time we were excited to come back and were not disappointed. check in was great, we were quickly acknowledged in a short queue and able to leave our luggage. room was great with fab views across the city and standard of the room was excellent - spotlessly clean. we were really delighted to come back to a bottle of proscecco from the hotel and a congratulatory note, such a lovely gesture - thankyou. we enjoyed a drink in the dandylyan bar which was lovely and breakfast was excellent too. cannot wait to come back !'''",2
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''from your arrival to departure this hotel truly makes your stay as luxurious and enjoyable as possible. | when we arrived at the hotel early in the morning the room was not quite ready yet (understandably) however they gave us some suggestions with things to do and the duty manager got in contact with us when the room was ready. the process was very easy. i had arranged for a cake and champagne to be delivered to the room when we arrived which was very nice and our butlers then proceeded to take us through and explain everything in our room. | the two gentleman who drive the rolls royce are a credit to the hotel they have an excellent local knowledge and really do stand out in our memory of the trip. this hotel is lucky to have these guys. they are great! likewise the butlers always act swiftly and any request you have is delivered upon. | i am not much of a cigar smoker however, the manager of the cigar lounge recommended a nice cigar for us to enjoy in the lounge which was a thoroughly enjoyable end to the evening. as a scotsman it was also a pleasure to see such a great collection of single malts which any whisky lover should make sure to indulge in. this is a collection anyone would be proud to have. | overall i find it hard to find any downfalls with our stay. we have stayed in other great hotels in london but the wellesley takes customer service to the next level. looking forward to returning soon.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i spent three days in the hotel with my friends. the room was clean, but there was not enough space between the beds. the owner was helpful and the breakfast was included in the price (eggs, toast bread, fruits, cheese and so on). it was also quite and nearby there were two lovely pubs. the metro station was only 5 minutes away from the hotel! the price was also good, the stuff friendly and it was central (2 minutes from hyde park).'''",2
The Savoy,"'''a simply great experience. service, expecially from the concierge guys was simply the best - and the decor and location made us feel that we got it right - and so did you !! it may feel a bit pricey but it was well worth it. | |'''",2
The Savoy,'''spent four nights with family. great hotel and staff. service was best i have come across in a long time. area very central and a lot to do within walking distance. close to public transport. would strongly recommend''',2
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''prime location! less than 5 minutes walking distance to harrods, harvey nichols and the hyde park. | modern decor, excellent service, amazing shower! | i just hated that when i asked for a late checkout when i checked in, they told me well let you know later on. | and on the day before our departure they were so dramatic about it! and they started making excuses of how busy they were! i told them that i was willing to pay for the extra night! they argued that they were full but they will let me know on the day of my departure! i immediately checked online and there were available rooms! i booked and paid and gave them my confirmation number! | they should have told me from the beginning that they did not offer a late checkout and that i needed to pay the room in full rate if i wanted to checkout later than 12 noon. they did not need to be so dramatic about it.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''just stayed here for a long weekend to celebrate my 40th birthday. notified hotel i was visiting and they gave me a complimentary upgrade including champagne a card and cake. luke neill the guest manager constantly liased with me to see if everything was to standard and nothing dissapointed. | as an architect i find this hotel a design dream. beautiful textured decor, gorgeous bathrooms and bedrooms, with the added bonus of having a cinema, roof top bar, restaurant and a fantastic cocktail bar on site. step outside and you are minutes away from shakespeare theatre, oxo tower, tate modern and all the south bank has to offer. this is one hip, relaxing and friendly hotel. it adds perfectly to this family of hotels that is based on great service and impeccable design.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i tend to come back to this small hotel on my trips to london. i was a visitor shortly after it opened and i am pleased to see that the hotel stays well maintained throughout years now. it is true that rooms are rather smallish, so if you like to stay in your room and enjoy the space, this is not the place. none the less, the rooms are clean and fresh. although small, the bathroom is pretty and modern with a walk in shower and loccitane toiletries (pleasant touch). i do tend to ask for a room away from the main road if they have availability, as the road side can be quite noisy. i tried their breakfast buffet too and enjoyed it. although the selection can be limited compared to 5 star hotels, you still find pretty much everything one would need for a decent breakfast. the restaurant area at the time i was there was not overcrowded so it was nice to relax there and enjoy the service. | the reception staff is always friendly and welcoming. the housekeeping does a good job too. i hope they keep up the standards as it is a nice place for a short stay in london.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''this was our first visit to the savoy hotel since it is refurbishment. well what can i say, fantastic. the refurbishment is perfect and it has kept its unique charm. | we ate in the savoy grill and the food was first class and the staff were very helpfull and always on hand to re fill your glass for you. after dinner we sat back and relaxed in the beaufort bar and watched the people come and go. we were also treated to a pianist who was very very good. we soon forget we are we were and melted into the atmosphere and | ambience that makes this place so special. | even if you only visit once you must sample the delights of the savoy, it is everything that is quintessentially english. | we will be seeing you soon. | many thanks'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the mandarin oriental hyde park has one of the most central locations in london, with beautiful views over hyde park on one side of the hotel. it also has excellent banqueting facilities, a fashionable bar and two of london's best restaurants. the rooms are extremely comfortable although it is worth paying up for a room with a view of the park. it is an old building (with a rather dated air conditioning unit in our room) and many of the hotel rooms look out onto a rather gloomy internal courtyard while others look onto knightsbridge (a great sight but also one of london's busier/noisier streets). there is an excellent spa in the basement, with saunas, steam rooms and a jacuzzi pool. | service was generally good , although the concierge/doormen services were surprisingly hit and miss. beware that your final bill has little relation to the quoted room rate - the rate quoted does not include vat (20%) or the 5% service charge on the accommodation. and on top of this the hotel charges for internet (at these room rates it should be included). other hotels such as the berkeley (a comparable hotel across the road from the mandarin) quote their rates including vat, which i think is the right way to do it.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''from the offset the corinthia hotel london was amazing. when entering the hotel the staff were welcoming. we checked in and had an upgrade on the room, this was fab. a truly and refreshing hotel with good staff. | if you decide to take a trip to london and are thinking of spending over 250 for a hotel, stretch that little more and stay here you will not be disappointed. | the pool area was very clean, with an excellent sauna. | the food was excellent and afternoon tea a must. | we would differently look at treating our selves again. | simon grove'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,'''this was our third stay in the corinthia and it is honestly one of my favourite hotels and definitely my favourite in london. | on this occasion we were only in london for one night as we were hosting a party to celebrate our daughter's 18th birthday. although the party was not held in the hotel there was a card and cake waiting for our daughter in her room on arrival which was a nice touch. | we enjoyed a delicious lunch in the northall restaurant on the saturday and an excellent breakfast on sunday morning. service at both meals was cheerful and helpful which seems to be a hallmark of the corinthia. the spa was as always sheer luxury and the staff at daniel galvin were wonderful. | the only reason i consistently give this hotel four stars instead of five is that despite all the positives it always seems to just miss the standard you should expect on all levels in a hotel of this category. on this occasion i ordered tea and biscuits through room service at around 5pm. about 50 minutes later i rang to check on my order and was told it should have already been delivered. it had not and so i cancelled the order. really a minor detail but i am picky and things like this are memorable. nonetheless i look forward to our next visit!''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''a lovely secret escapes getaway for the night. great location. superior room, very spacious and lovely and clean. very relaxing bar area for a cocktail or a coffee. only downside for us was the breakfast, which we had brought up to our room. arrived on time but was cold . however we really did enjoy our stay here and will return soon.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''amazing hotel and a favorite place for us... this time we experienced the real christmas spirit with the quaint sweet shop in the entrance as well as the gorgeous christmas tree and giant gingerbread house. we received a gift of a delicious traditional christmas pudding in an elegant white gift box too ! the staff from front office to cleaning staff are always pleasant , friendly and most helpful and the beds cannot be described aptly ! across the road was the fun winter wonderland in hyde park.... i cannot wait to go back !'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my husband and i recently stayed a night in a corner suite for our anniversary. the staff made the effort for our stay to be extra special. the room was absolutely fabulous - stunningly decorated, spacious and had everything we needed. i also had an incredible 80 min massage at aqua spa which i highly recommend. the staff at the spa were friendly and attentive and my masseuse was excellent. i cannot wait to come back and stay and enjoy the facilities. thank you!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we live just outside of london but come in every day to work. we like our weekend breaks and have picked the mondrian 4 times now and are already looking into our next stay. we love it here. | it has such a chilled vibe, i love the decor in every room we have stayed in and the hotels very odd design and incredible views over the thames. | try to go for a room with a bath, they are lovely but then again so are the rainfall showers. also a room with a river view makes the stay just that much better! | the spa staff are wonderful. we have had some of the best massages at the mondrian spa. the gym was also great, and pretty empty when we visited! | breakfast is always lovely with a choice of a la cart or buffet. i went for crab scrambled eggs which were delicious whilst my boyfriend went for the buffet and dinner at the sea containers has also been great. | would 100% recommend staying here'''",2
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''i have stayed in the bulgari the last three times i visited london. it is luxuriously dark, extremely clean and well attended to. the amenities in the room are just fabulous &amp; smell so good. there is plenty of closet space which is great if you are a heavy traveler. the bed is extremely comfortable. | the downside to the hotel is the view is not all that and the room service food was average. | the location is perfect, just a few steps away from hyde park, shopping heavens such as harrods and harvey nichols. their spa is one of the best, featuring margaret dabbs. the gym is also great with the bodyism system.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i arranged a work event at the mondrian last week to be held at screening rooms (which holds 150 in reception area and 56 in cinema room down in the heart of the hotel in the sub basement - great drinks, canapes and food plus you can even have fresh popcorn served to your guests!!! | the event staff are fantastic - samm, golnaz and the rest of the team could not do enough to help me organise and manage the night which was a complete success! | as a hotel to stay, it is got to be the coolest in london - thames views from the southbank side, funky music from soul, hiphop, rap, jazz etc piping through the bars and lounges - awesome food in the hotel restaurant, great drinks in the dandelyan (again fab music and cool place to hang) and then the rooms . . . . superb views and the staff could not do enough for us during our stay the weekend! | big thanks goes out to brittney, bernardo, ricardo, josh, francesco, ada and zsolt . . . . attentive, friendly and not over the top but you nothing was too much to ask or too small to arrange! | i would wholly recommend this to anyone, do not think you will find a finer hotel in london!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i stayed here for 3 days, and the stay, quite frankly, was brilliant! we ate at the hotel, and enjoyed the bar and restaurant as well as the rooms themselves. i was fortunate enough to be upgraded to a river view suite with a balcony, and as the sun decided to shine that was absolutely perfect. the hotel is quiet, soundproofing excellent. the staff are friendly, helpful, very relaxed and enjoyed every aspect of the experience. the rooms were very user friendly, as you expect from a new hotel plenty of power points and good clean finishes. coffee and tea included with a wee machine. my friend forgot her tooth brush, hair brush and razor and the hotel happily and quickly provided all at no extra cost. two very small things...checking in we were stood around as only one staff member who was serving a walk in and kind of left me...always immediately check with arriving guests, we were booked and the walk in can wait a moment! second, struggled to find a way to play my music, not obvious without trying to go through the tv...i am used to some kind of idock type arrangement. anyway, amazing, really enjoyed the whole experience in every way :-) positioning could be better either, 5 mins walk in either direction took you to the west end or the london eye, dungeon and so forth...'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we are just back from our 2 night trip to london and enjoyed our stay in the rembrandt hotel and had a fantastic time in london. nice decor in reception and was greeted by friendly staff on arrival. we stayed in a double superior room on the 6th floor (641) with great views of the v&amp;a museum which was directly across the road. i had requested a front-facing room when booking. from walking around the hotel, i would assume that some rooms would not have had much of a view, so it might be a good idea to make a request such as this when booking. rooms are small, but we have certainly stayed in smaller! the fully-stocked mini-bar was a nice touch and we had a jucuzzi bath in our bathroom too. breakfast was great. nice selection of hot food, cereals and the usual continental bits also. we had a full english to set us up for the day each morning. tube station is literally 2 mins walk away. take the exit that is signposted 'museums' when exiting south kensington station and head right on exiting to take you to the hotel. would love to go back to see the natural history museum and the v&amp;a which are right beside the hotel, but we went to winter wonderland in hyde park and spent a day on oxford street instead, so maybe next time! overall a positive experience. only small negative would be that the walls between the bathrooms backing onto the room next to ours were perhaps a little thin! small bit of soundproofing would not go astray there! could not hear any noise from the bedroom however so it was not much of a complaint. great hotel, would definetly recommend.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''having been lucky enough to to stay in some of the best hotels in london, this has got to be my favourite. | the rooms are comfortable, well equipped and stylish and the bars/restaurants are top notch (i particularly enjoy the bar for cocktails).'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''small hotels around paddington seem pretty indistinguishable from each other but this place should stand out due to modern rooms, excellent service and plentiful breakfast. the hotel retains its character but the refurbished bedrooms are really comfortable, though small and several flights of stairs to many. definitely the best small hotel among the many i have stayed in around paddington and excellent value for money for london and for being right by the tube/mainline.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we were not going to stay there as it was more than our budget , but as soon as we walked in the door me and my wife were hooked the decor the atmosphere the modern art the big ceilings the den where we chilled at any time on those large leather couches, it was simply the best looking and friendliest hotel we ever been to in london and the distance from everywhere covent garden , city hall , the shard was a breeze to walk to. | |'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''on arrival the reception staff were very friendly and helpful and took only a few minutes to get our keys,our room (715) on the 7th floor had a balcony which had a nice view of the shard building, room was spotless and nice touches added with some free mini bar items and water. also some nice touches in the bathroom. we only ate lunch in the hotel and it was good enough and reasonably priced. overall a good hotel and great staff |'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i had not stayed at the hotel since its first opening as the mandarin oriental quite some time ago and probably would not have returned if i had not been going to eat at dinner by heston blumental. we were very pleasantly surprised by our fairly spacious room with a lovely view over the park at the back of the hotel, which was comfortable and most importantly very quiet. the room had french windows which actually open and would be a great choice at any time of year but was really special with the autumn colours of the trees. | the facilities are as expected in a hotel of the class and size, only niggle (as usual) is the charge for internet access.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''very nice hotel with great facilities and excellent level of service. enjoyed my 4 night stay - changed rooms during the stay and the staff were very helpful and efficient. they same could be said of my check-out and whenever assistance was sought.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed at the rembrandt for 13 nights from december 16-29, 2013 and loved it: (1) although my [tastefully decorated, typically british] room was on the front of the hotel facing the victoria &amp; albert museum, there was no street noise or harsh light. (2) the hotel feels safe, because you use the room key card to operate the elevators, because the tall windows in the front rooms have double-paned doors over them, and because there is [also] a chain lock on the door to the room. (3) the breakfast room is enormous; the breakfast buffet huge, clean and well maintained. pick up a free newspaper in the lounge, then take your choice of cereals, fruits, cheeses, cold cuts, porridge, eggs (fried, scrambled, hard boiled), sausages, bacon, broiled tomatoes, beans, light yogurt (try the cranberry/raspberry!), breads/rolls/baguettes/pastries/muffins, juices, water, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc. (4) the samsung tv in the room has high definition channels in several languages including english, arabic, italian and french, and there is even music available on the set. (5) the water pressure in the bathroom is amazing; the hot water is so hot that one can sanitize a toothbrush. | the hotel's location is perfect for the underground, neighborhood walks and the hop on hop off tour bus: (1) it is a short walk to the south kensington tube station, which is a stop on the train from heathrow. use that station to go to piccadilly or leicester square for most theatres, and you can be there in 20 minutes. (2) walking around the area where the hotel is located is fun. within a day you will feel like it is your own neighborhood. a marks &amp; spencer local (the sign says m &amp; s simply food) grocery store is 3 blocks from the hotel on the same side of the street; across from it is a sainsbury's local. i asked the hotel to remove everything from the minibar, and stocked the small refrigerator with pre-made sandwiches, bottles of wine and water. harrods is 5 short blocks from the hotel, and their food hall is amazing. if you are not a do-it-yourself person, there are many restaurants in the neighborhood that smell wonderful when you pass by. (3) the original london hop on hop off tour bus picks up passengers in front of the victoria &amp; albert museum, just across the street from the hotel. you can redeem a voucher or buy a ticket on board then do the museum loop on that bus, and/or change at piccadilly (near the aberdeen steak house) for a different loop that takes in the tower of london, the tate modern, westminster, sloane street, etc. that bus could drop you off at harrods then it is a short walk back to the hotel, or catch the museum loop bus back to the victoria &amp; albert and walk across the street to the rembrandt. | in terms of safety, what is included, and location, the rembrandt in london is my favorite of all the hotels in london i have stayed at over the past 40 years. highly recommended. i just wish the wait staff in the breakfast buffet room would stop asking ""are you ok?"" every two minutes. that seems to be a new question from londoners in retail, too, and it drove me nuts by the second day. here in the usa, we would ask that question if someone fell down a flight of stairs, not while someone is eating a muffin!'''",2
London Guest House,"'''our room was a double room on the ground floor, spacious enough (i have been to places where you could hardly move around!!) and very clean. the location is good, perfect for what we needed: you have piccadilly, central and district line all within 15mins walking distance or 10mins by bus (bus 266 literally stops in front of the guest house). quiet neighbourhood, breakfast included and a good balance quality-price. definitely recommended.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i stayed at the ridgemount hotel for 3 nights in june 09 and i really enjoyed my stay. a great solution for a low budget hotel in a fantastic location. if you are looking for a simple room to stay at and have a place to crash at night, this is the place for you. on my next time in london i will definitely come back. | it was the first time in london for us, 4 friends on our early 20s. we took a quad room on the 4th floor facing the street with a private bathroom. the shared bathroom also seemed nice and clean, but we prefered adding a couple of pounds for en-suite. | pros: | * great value for the money! we paid about 100 for the four of us per night, including breakfast - one of the cheapest offers we could find. | * great location, short ride on the tube to every central tourist site. | * 5 min. walk from 2 tube stations (goodge, euston square). | * the rooms are clean. very clean. | * clean towels every day. | * the quad room had one double bed and two small ones, all were comfortable. | * gower street seems safe, around ridgemount there are mostly other small hotels and what seems to be student dormitories. as a young woman i felt safe walking alone at night. | * free wifi. not too stable on the 4th floor, though. you can always go down to the small lounge downstairs, it also has a pc if you do not own a laptop. | * english breakfast included, nice and simple. | * friendly staff, very helpful! in our first day they asked us what is the purpose of our trip and suggested help and guidance every single day. | * nice atmosphere - feels very homy. | cons: | the cons are really minor considering the price and the pros. | * 4 floors, no elevator. getting to the 4th floor with luggage is no easy task. | * no air conditioner, and our first day was pretty hot for london. on a typical weather it is no problem. | * the street is pretty noisy, even at night. it is not so bad on the upper floors, but i guess it is worse downstairs. if avilable, ask for a room facing the garden. | * smokers can only smoke on the street outside the hotel. | * the furniture is pretty old. | * our quad room was pretty crowded for the four of us, the beds are small and the bathroom was tiny.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we always visit the american bar when in london but this time around we did things differently. we started off in the gorgeous beaufort bar having the best kir royale ever, great pianist and vibe. then onto kaspar's grill, great service, decor and ambience. most delicious fish and chips with excellent wine. after dinner relax in the lounge listening to nicole emmanuelle, she was fabulous, i could have clicked finger all night, the music was superb. and oh, the flowers in the foyer are stupendous.'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''everything was perfect, from the room, its interior, facilities and fast free internet! however, i believe the front desk staff should be more courteous, alert and asked guess first instead the guess has to wait a little to approach. they should smile more often too :), look very serious. anyway, that was just a small part only, no big deal..but it is nice right to smile and approach guess, so that we know that we were feel like home and welcomed. :)'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''excellent hotel. the staff really make the place. they are extremely friendly and helpful. breakfast was yummy and we had lunch also which was good. the attention to detail is second to none. our room was fantastic. location is great not far from liverpool street station which is on the central line. quiet at night so you sleep well.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here with my partner for my birthday and it was okay. location was great in terms of being opposite the v&amp;a and tuns of lovely restaurants near by. check in staff were really friendly but a lot of things let it down for me. room was pleasant- perfectly fine. | booked a spa treatment earlier in the week and when i arrived, barely any greeting - when i went into the treatment room what they had written down was wrong and whilst the therapist was very nice, the management and front of house staff were very unprofessional. through the massage all i could hear was children screaming - not relaxing at all. my partner was going to meet me in the spa (which he had to pay for), when we got there, children were everywhere so impossible to relax. we sat for 5 mins in the jacuzzi then decided to leave. what a waste. on the morning we were checking out cleaners knocked out door twice at 10am to try and clean the room. again whilst they were very nice, it seemed like poor organisation and communication from the management.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''i have visited this place in march for a spring break. i have been welcomed great fully and been upgraded from an executive room to a 1 bedroom suite. | the suite has two access doors and two toilets with showers and a living room and a dinning table. | the lobby is also a great place to stay in during the day for a cup of tea. however, the breakfast is a menu style, which i really do not like, i tend to enjoy the buffet more. | i really enjoyed my stay at the dorchester.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we booked this hotel after having been recommended and it was a great choice. we booked for bed and breakfast and on arrival was impressed with the building and hugely impressed by the location - right on the south bank. ricardo on reception could not have been more helpful, and changed our room as the one booked was not ready. we were on the top floor with great views. we had drinks in the dandelyan bar and pre-dinner drinks in the rumpus rooms on the top floor. the rooms were very comfortable and the breakfast had literally everything you could think of. would definitely stay again.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''one of the best boutique hotels i have stayed at. the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. i loved the small personalised touches such as macaroons every evening and the easter egg during the easter long weekend. | the room is small but its actually sufficient and considered large for london. our room was cleaned twice a day so it was really clean! toilet amenities are great too. | superb location with 2 train lines near-by. close to royal albert hall, science museum, hyde park etc. and many local pubs, pharmacies and super markets near-by. | definitely would stay here again and highly recommend!'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''a lovely hotel, ideally located to imperial college which we were visiting. my daughter and i had a comfortable twin room to the rear of the hotel, currently the room is overlooking some building works but i think in the future that will not be an issue. the reception staff were friendly and helpful and i would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. i plan to stay at the rembrandt the next time i visit. it is a very convenient location for the general area.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''from check-in to check-out it was a delight to stay at the hotel. the staff are attentive, friendly and helpful. little touches like lending us an umbrella, providing gluten free bread in the restaurant and coming to our room very quickly to address a problem with the blueray player were appreciated. the hotel decor is great - modern and in very good order. the superior rooms are lovely. we stayed at the weekend for leisure, rather than business but it is ideal for both. its very well located for moorgate and liverpool street tube stations and close-by the financial centre and sights. definitely one i would recommend and will stay at again.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the single room was what i expected- tiny with a single bed. it was cozy and i had a nice view of the street below, which was quiet at night. | the hotel is within walking distance of paddington station which was a selling point for me as i was planning on using the underground for all of my transportation. | the people at the front desk were polite and professional. the continental breakfast was fresh and filling. the hotel overall seemed well-maintained. | do be advised that there is no elevator in the hotel and there are a lot of stairs to climb if you are on one of the upper floors.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''early in february we stayed at the savoy for karine's birthday. from the doormen taking the luggage from the trunk to being greeted and checked in (within a private office) to being introduced to the concierge (all of whom seem to have their les clefs dor), the hotel is seamless and very comfortable. service comes naturally to all staff and while there, you must have a drink in the american bar; winner of many awards and try a ""moon walk"". simply put... this is the property in which you should hang your hat while in london!'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i loved our stay here. the couple that run the place were extremely nice and very helpful with any questions we had - as were the other staff. the breakfast ladies (who double as cleaning staff once breakfast is cleared) are very efficient and fast. room was nice, clean and comfortable - but there are no lifts, so you will have to lug suitcases upstairs yourself. rooms have tv with plenty of channels (though no hbo/showtime as us customers might be used to) and free wifi everywhere. | the breakfast comprises any or all of: orange juice (good quality), tea/coffee, cereal, toast, and a cooked plate which varies day to day, but usually comprises two rashers of back-bacon, an egg and one other rotating item such as sausage, tomato, baked beans, etc. very good - we really filled up for the day! there is also free tea/coffee anytime from a machine in the lounge, and cold drinks that can be purchased from another machine (50p/can). | access is easy, with a short walk to goodge st. tube station, or a longer one to russel square station. and the british museum is just at the end of the road. there are also many shops and restaurants within easy walk, including a tesco supermarket round the corner from goodge st. station, with a big selection of cheap pre-made sandwiches and warm food items, drinks etc. they have meal deals of sandwich, snack (chips/crisps) and a drink for 3gbp. all the west end theaters are nearby - less than a mile walk or short tube ride - as are the famous oxford and regent street shops. if you go to the theater, plenty of unsold tickets are available one or near the day, at up to half price off, from various online sources or the ticket booth in leicester square (we saw a couple of shows while there, averaging 30-40gbp per seat in the stalls close to the stage). | we really enjoyed our stay at the ridgemount and would heartily recommend it to anyone.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''we stayed at this beautiful hotel for one night whilst on a short trip to london to see the bafta'a. this hotel, its surroundings, beautiful rooms, delightful food and amazing staff truly made our stay a memorable one. from the minute we arrived we received the most professional, friendly and genuine service from the hotel staff. nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel valued and welcome. i cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. we will be back next time we are in london. thank you to all the staff at the dorchester.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''i stayed here with my husband for a 3 day trip to london in january and were very pleased with the hotel. we had a very clean, comfortable room, even if it was a little small. our bathroom had a lovely spa bath which was excellent for a long hot soak after a days sightseeing. it is located 5 minutes walk from the south kensington tube station, and in a lovely area for good restaurants, cafes, and traditional english pubs. also 10 minutes from harrods. it is directly across the road from the v&amp;a museum and 3 mins to the science and natural history museum. the buffet breakfast was excellent, everything you could want, traditional english, fruit, juices, lots of cereals and yoghurts. the only complaint about this hotel is that the walls are quite thin, but this is easily sorted by a set of earplugs.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''on a week-long business meeting that would take me to every part of greater london, i chose hotel xenia and it admirably suited my needs. i booked a small single room - and yes, it was small, but sunny, cheerful, and quiet. there were enough nooks and crannies that i was able to organize my stuff and not be tripping over things during the week. the hotel is within a 5-7 minute walk of two tube stops, and also very close to grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants. i would not call the immediate neighborhood ""charming,"" but it was safe and convenient. the bed linens were great and i slept well. the bathroom, though very small, was well appointed (great towels and l'occitane products - but bring your own tissues as those that are provided are only good for wiping up small spills). a hotpot was tucked away inside the closet, and though it proved challenging to find outlets for all my needs (hotpot, hairdryer, charging electronics) - i had to unplug and replug things repeatedly -- i managed. with the hotpot came instant coffee and various (good quality) teas. the desk was big enough for me to use my laptop and files, so i could work well. my window opened so i could get fresh air. the staff were invariably attentive and pleasant. i did not use the restaurant or bar - but they looked lively and pleasant. if i came on vacation this may not be the hotel i would choose just because of location - but on the other hand it provided very good value for price.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''once a year i take some friends for a weekend in london . a nice hotel and a great meal and good company. the mandarin hyde park is in my opinion the best of the 5 star hotels i have stayed in. real service delivered well. | if anything the bar is on the small side but still very nice.''',2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 teenagers) and we spent 6 nights here in january and in summary it was great, very central, very clean, fabulous filling breakfasts (cooked breakfast included every day) and the owners and their staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. | yes, the rooms are small however we had enough room for the 4 of us in the family room. the family room is on the very top floor - loads of steps when carrying your bags, so if you are unable to climb and carry do not stay here. the beds are also small for tall people. | we loved this hotel and will definitely stay here again, where else can a family of 4 stay for 96 pounds in london that is handy to the tube station, buses at your door, the theatre - showing ""we will rock you"" - a definite must to see, a pub around the corner that had cheap budget style meals. | a place we will recommend to everyone.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this is a fantastic hotel. location wise, it is just off trafalgar square. the service given is exquisite. from the moment you check in, to the concierge, and the staff at the spa. the spa, which is based over 4 floors, is impossible to explain in words, with world class facilities, a sauna with glass walls and a great service in the area. the rooms are very well kept, comfortable, with excellent bathrooms.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed at mondrian for 5 days during a business visit earlier this month - this was my first stay there. | location: the hotel is very conveniently located - right on the river bank and close to black friars and waterloo stations. the tourist spots like st. paul cathedral or london eye etc. are quite close by. also, there are quite a few good restaurants with in 10-15min walk from the hotel which is very helpful. so, full marks for the location... | room: i was on the 9th floor in a standard room. room was quite spacious and the bed was comfortable. the specially liked the amenities provided in the bathroom which again was quite spacious :) the collection in the mini-bar was also good. | restaurants and food - i did not try the breakfast or the food at the restaurant as there were not too many options for vegetarians. the hostess did mention that the chef would be happy to accommodate any specific request in case i did not like any of the options in the menu but we chose to have our dinner elsewhere. we did however had evening drinks at the bar and they were good. the ambiance, music were quite good and staff was attentive and helpful.... | cons - not aware of them being part of any loyalty programs as such. being part of such program would be nice as well ! | overall - an excellent hotel. i would definitely go back whenever i visit london again.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''this is a newer hotel and we booked a superior room that was spacious compared to other london hotels where i have stayed. | large bathroom with tub and shower. the bed was very comfortable and the nearly silent ac made the nights restful. | there is a restaurant and bar. it is a short walk to the moorgate tube station. staff is very friendly and helpful. highly recommended.''',2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''suite was fabulous and staff were efficient and friendly.room was immaculately clean and hotel was in good location. we were disturbed in the morning with local building work. spoke to staff on check out who were very apologetic and offered a discounted rate on a future stay with the hotel.''',2
The Savoy,"'''second time having afternoon tea at the savoy. the food is lovely (although the vegetarian sandwiches were not quite as nice as the first time we went). scones and preserves are sublime! after our first visit, we learnt not to ask for seconds as the whole 'meal' is actually very filling! had lovely vanilla black tea. only downside was a bit of noise coming from the adjacent restaurant (doors were left open).'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''excellent location, amazing staff and what views ... better than t.v. not really cheap but definitely worth a splash-out. rombus bar is always very busy, so make sure to reserve because all london wants to enjoy cocktails with this stunning view!'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''this is an excellent hotel and would highly recommend it. feel hotel deserves to be in top 100 in london. the rembrandt faade is a beautiful architectual structure and upon entering, you are not disappointed. the original internal features of a period build are still very much in place and it certainly adds to the appeal. top spot for couples as this is how we stayed first time round. we asked for an executive king room again and an interconnecting executive double/twin for our children. the room combination worked perfectly and children were secure and we as parents could feel relaxed ourselves, large rooms with space foe energetic children, lovely to have seating area to sit later with glass of wine. free wifi i believe. as far as location in london is concerned, the rembrandt is certainly one of the best locations we have ever stayed in, the area is quiet and you have a feeling of staying in a unique setting of yesteryear, with an intimacy and safety due to its individual setting aound thurloe. it is 3 minutes from south kensington underground which is good from paddington. at this hotel,you are opposite the v&amp;a which is free entry and 5 minutes walk from th natural history museum, science museum, royal geographical society and royal albert hall etc. the original tour bus company pick up at v&amp;a opposite and we used this private bus tour company to travel across london rather than use underground and you get to see so much above ground with a river trip thrown in too! i must mention the food at the rembrandt, as we had breakfast and dinner. with kids as everyone knows, they can be fussy eaters, but we were delighted with the choice available on children's menu and it was so reasonable from 2.50 each child. we will definately be back, a rare spot indeed thank you to all for yet another enjoyable stay with our 12 and 9 year old in tow, experience stressfree due to everything being thought out well before we arrived! we will definately be back. mrs b glos/wilts.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''you often hear that the most important thing is ""location, location, location"" and this hotel is right where you want to be for a wonderful stay in london. bus stops just outside, tube 2 minutes away, the best museums in the world just across the road and the west end less than 10 minutes away - who could ask for more? this hotel delivers fabulous rooms with plenty of room and a wonderful bathroom. the room has tea and coffee making facility which is wonderful. breakfast is enough to keep you going all day. the staff are very friendly - including the housekeepers. had a fabulous london break here and will definitely stay again.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''i do not usually write reviews when i have nothing further to add to previous reviewers but our experience was so fabulous i felt i wanted to underline just how unique i feel that this hotel is. | we stayed only one night in order to meet our daughter for dinner in the savoy grill. | we were professionally and warmly greeted by the doormen. our car was valet parked (a very reasonable 25 for our 'hybrid' lexus - 50% discount for hybrids) | every member of staff with whom we came into contact was without fail, charming, professional &amp; helpful. in fact, we were treated royally. | our pre dinner cocktails in the american bar and the beaufort bar (we had to try them both!!) were just right. | our dinner in the grill was superb. | the whole hotel had the feeling of grace &amp; charm of a bygone era. it made me proud to be a londoner. | thank you savoy for a very memorable stay. i would return tomorrow if i could.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''thank you so much for the amazing service offered by your staff particularly your out of hours waiters in the bar area and in the early hours of saturday 30th may, nothing was too much for them. | also, my thanks go out to your concierge paul stocker who did his best to help me with my congestion charge. there were all sorts of issues but he persevered and kept me informed long after i departed from your hotel. i cannot thank these people enough for the excellent service they provided, they are an absolute credit to your hotel.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''good value for the price, situated in quiet lane, | location superb, close to two tube stations, access to 6 lines | paddington being the station of the expensive but fast heathrow express. | rooms small, but clean, | good continental breakfast'''",2
The Savoy,"'''myself and a few friends recently visited the savoy hotel, we ate in kaspers restaurant. we all shared a few starters, the goat cheese and fig salad was one of my favourites. the steaks were amazing, we all went for filets. | the service was amazing, nothing to fault. our waiter was from south africa was especially amazing, very attentive and went the extra mile to make our night memorable. | i would highly recommend eating there. | huge thanks to the team in kaspers for making our evening fantastic, we will definitely be back.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''had a magnificent experience at this hotel. i had a turret jr. suite and it was fabulous. i had a sitting area in the turret and had wonderful views of knightsbridge at night with the christmas lights it was breathtaking. the bed was a very cozy and i had a very large bathroom. service was excellent. my daughter met me at the hotel and we had tea at the stunning rosebery lounge and we ate one night at the bar boulud which was excellent. the hotel is also perfectly situated for hyde park which we went to the winter wonderland and it had a lovely christmasmarket. will go back next year same time, loved it!'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,'''we thrive excellently well at rhodes and always try to stay there when we are in london. location is good and the accommodation comfortable. we like the breakfast and the owner's personal and caring style. often he offers a pleasant conversation and something extra to eat!''',2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''the apex london wall hotel was the setting for my proposal to my girlfriend (now fianc). from the very first conversation with rosario i knew it was going to be the perfect place. from booking out the restaurant, helping to put my own choice of music over the sound system and providing first class personalised service for the entire stay, the staff could not have been more helpful. the room was fantastic (the balcony is an excellent addition!) and the overall cleanliness and service from the hotel was impeccable. they contributed to the special occasion as each staff member congratulated us and they were extremely helpful with the preparation beforehand. i recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely be staying there in the near future. thank you apex for a stay we will never forget!!!'''",2
The Rembrandt,'''my teenage daughter and i visited london and stayed here. we looked out our window at the victoria and albert museum and down the street to harrod's. great location. the staff was helpful and the food good. i would stay here again and have set this as the standard in london while traveling.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''this is a gem of a hotel, situated extremely close to harrods, the science museum and the national history museum. it is constructed - as are many london hotels - inside a series of old houses, so that you will encounter several twists and turns and little ramps as you discover your room. nevertheless, it is sparklingly clean, very quiet and yet busy in the lounge and bar areas. it is position that sells it, however. there can hardly be a better place to explore london from than this little jewel. well-placed sources also indicate that european royalty often use the hotel to stay on visits to the capital.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed here after attending a wedding in london. arrived before our room was ready but were able to use the spa to get changed, which was great. staff were so helpful and attentive and nothing was to much trouble. they were extremely approachable and pleasant. we stayed in a room on the top floor and it had excellent views. modern and funky rooms with comfort bed. unfortunately we had to leave early the next day and did not have time to sample breakfast. definitely want to go back.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''recently stayed 4 nights at this hotel to celebrate my husband's birthday. we had an executive king size room which had a wonderful view overlooking the v &amp; a museum and despite there being a main road outside, the room was exceptionally quiet. on arrival we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of wine and hand written birthday card in our room which was a very nice touch. the facilities in our room were excellent, everything you would expect. in our bathroom we had a jacuzzi bath which was glorious. breakfast was excellent, very well organised with staff being helpful and efficient without being overbearing. we also used the swimming pool attached to the hotel which was a lovely relaxing place to spend some time after a busy day out. | we found the location of the hotel to be brilliant with the underground just a short walk away giving us easy access to almost anywhere in london, and plenty of shops, restaurants, and places to visit nearby. | all in all an excellent 'homely' hotel that we would be happy to recommend and return to again.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed here following a series of unhappy stays at other london hotels with the same star rating. it was like a breath of fresh air. the staff are welcoming, polite and helpful, the rooms clean and spacious, breakfast was excellent....we shall certainly return here the next time we stay in london.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''worldwide traveler and this is the best hotel in the world. location, employees and service...you will find no better anywhere in the world. it is a little expensive , but as they say...you pay for what you get!!! |'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''the corinthia is best summed up in one word - service. the staff are very adept in being attentive to your every wish and this, coupled with the crisp, elegant decor and quiet, understated luxury makes this hotel one of the best places i have ever stayed. the bedrooms are cozy and comfortable with high-thread count linens, plush terry cloth towels and thick carpeting. the dining options are impeccable including the splendid breakfast buffet and the spa is second to none. i have been pampering myself on this trip working out in the gym followed by relaxing on the thermal floor. from the moment you enter the hotel, located just off of a busy, noisy street, you feel the quiet and calm enveloping you.... i would live here if i could!'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at the rembrandt two years ago and again this past month. we had a very good experience both stays. we splurged on a ""club room"" this year and the extra space was really nice, but definitely not essential. (we had a spacious bathroom with a whirlpool tub, a desk, a small sofa bed and two chairs, plus robes and slippers.) this year the room price included a cell phone for use during our stay. we did not need it, since we brought our own, but it would have been handy otherwise. the hotel's location is perfect, being a 5-minute walk from a tube stop and away from the most crowded areas of the city. it is also across the street from the wonderful victoria and albert museum, which we visited twice, and we were able to easily walk to a concert one evening at the royal albert hall (which i highly recommend). it is not a large or grand hotel, but it is clean, attractive, comfortable and appears to be well-run, and has most everything you need (small health club and pool next door is an extra charge, but we did not use them). this year we could not take advantage of the savings to be achieved by paying in full in advance (due to last minute uncertainties in our schedule), but still found the price to be a good value, especially considering the buffet breakfast included in the price. we also found all of the staff to be pleasant and helpful, including front desk, bartender and dinner wait staff (alex was very good), room attendant/maid, and breakfast staff who always made sure we had plenty of coffee or tea. off the small main lobby is a small area to sit and have drinks, or a meal. we had dinner there three nights of our ten-night stay and were happily surprised at the quality of the food. we are light sleepers and were quite pleased with the lack of noise from adjacent rooms that is so common in many modern hotels these days! we were pleased with the room location during our previous stay, but this year asked to move rooms after the first night because we were on the first floor overlooking the main road, primarily due to lack of privacy when the curtains were opened (the bed was just a few feet from the window). despite the double-pane windows, we could also hear some road noise at night (which frankly we could have tolerated, had the privacy aspect been better). the second room overlooked an inner ""courtyard"" on the third floor, which was much quieter, but the lower part of the window had been frosted to block the not-so-attractive view. plus, others across the way could in theory see in our windows through the top (unfrosted) part. this did not bother us so much, since the room was perfectly fine otherwise (and we just remembered to keep the curtains fully closed when getting dressed). next time i would ask for an upper floor, and one that does not face the inner courtyard. despite these minor negatives, all in all we were happy with the hotel, and would stay here again and recommend it to friends.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''great location, very stylish, spacious and classy rooms, great food and the best service i have experienced in a hotel in years (probably ever) - and all for under 200 a night. almost too good to be true. and a special mention for the front office manager - daniel berardi - who was exemplary: relaxed, friendly and always thinking about how to make the guests' stay even better. he was superb. i will definitely go back and will recommend to all colleagues and friends.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''this hotel was the absolute cherry on top of a wonderful london weekend break. being in a most suitable, central location, it was very easy to travel around the remainder of the city from there. after tiring days the beds were so very comfortable and with no outside noise at all, we slept as soundly as we possibly could. the rooms could not be better, were superbly clean and had everything you would expect. we ate dinner in the restaurant on the first night and it was excellent; in fact, the best ravioli my friend had ever tasted. overall the food was delicious and the breakfast was to die for. there were so many choices, and all beautifully presented. the dining areas themselves have been imaginatively layed-out, giving a fairly intimate feel that meant you felt comfortable and not swamped. all the staff were very well trained and polite without being overly intrusive. a really great stay and thoroughly recommended to anyone visiting london.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''delightful in every way..we had a lovely one night stay including spa break,hotel is mind blowing staff amazing,breakfast amazing.we will be back.thank you very much for the upgrade on are room.everything is beautiful you are all doing a truly amazing job.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''i stayed for 8 nights on a business trip accompanied by my daughter who was on vacation. being her first time to the uk the front desk staff were extremely patient and helpful to give her tips on places to visit.the room was very comfortable, super-clean and linen of top quality. housekeeping was very flexible about room making up times. the biggest plus was the attitude of the staff: they were so friendly and helpful at all times and are a very, very motivated group of people. they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and showed a genuine desire to take the time to make sure all was well especially for my daughter who was a first-time visitor to the country. i have stayed at grand and not-so-grand hotels in over 54 cities and this by far was the best experience for me. warm and professional hospitality with a soul ...!'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''despite reading mixed reviews, we found the staff to be very friendly, helpful and concerned about our stay there. we spent the first two days in a old, but clean room. i had a problem with a bed which was immediately fixed. this area of the hotel was definitely a 'two-star'. then we were moved to their second location which had been renovated and much nicer. typical european small room, but clean. this is a renovated town house, so you do hear the neighbors and there is no elevator/lift, but they will carry your luggage for you. you still have to walk ups several flights of stairs so this hotel is not good for the disabled. included breakfast was pleasant, staff was there to greet and treat you. it is close to the paddington station and restaurants, little shops, and the best meal we ate in london was at the local pub, the victoria. do stop by the victoria! | thank you, rhodes! we enjoyed the visit!'''",2
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''from arthur greeting us upon arrival and regaling us with the history of the building, pre it being a pizza express when i was a child, to the perfectly attentive service in the bar our visit was a total treat. the wellesley is the perfect example of chic discreet hospitality without any pretence at all which is so difficult to find in the area these days. stay as you are and i will keep coming back.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''we had a wonderful stay at the savoy on our final day of our uk holiday. though we were staying in the lowest tier of rates, we were treated like royalty. the rooms are stylish, large and super comfortable, with the ability to cool the room at night and many lighting options that actually enable you to have bright light as well as atmospheric light. both are very rare in my experience. you were left with the feeling that you were a guest from the era of downton abbey and in a quintessentially fine london hotel, not a bland hotel anywhere. we dined at kaspar's and enjoyed it so much that we went back on two other occasions. we would love to stay again.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this is the second time i have stayed at the mondrian. the rooms are well appointed and pleasant. the hotel has free wifi in the rooms, which is, in my view, a business necessity. i was disappointed that my request for an early checkin was not honored, even though i called several days in advance to see if it could be accommodated (unless i wanted to pay gbp 60 per night to upgrade my room). the location of the hotel -- on the south end of blackfriars bridge is convenient to the city, as well as to south bank venues including the tate modern. there is considerable construction near the hotel at the end of the bridge, which can make driving and walking in the area difficult.'''",2
The Savoy,'''at the time of booking we did not realize how amazing and historic this hotel is but once we arrived we realized this is going to be a great vacation. | for european standards our room was large and very very comfortable. the service is as expected from any fairmont property. just the best you will find. | we loved the tea room and the location. even during our boat tour they showed the hotels to the tourists as a london landmark. i must say we were excited about tea and scone but the scones did not taste as good as they looked but the entire experience was wonderful.''',2

The Savoy,"'''we booked the savoy as part of our annual christmas shopping break. our normal choice being new york / waldorf astoria. the savoy was no let down. on arrival we were immediately hit with how warm and welcoming the hotel was, along with its staff. we would normally look to upgrade our room however,here, there was no need. rooms were spacious,beautifully dressed and cosy. in fact the whole hotel was. it is the first hotel that upon check in, you honestly feel that the staff are only addressing you, very nice touch. we will stay here again and look forward to it.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''i visited the hotel with my sister for sunday lunch on the day of the london olympic marathon. we were very much looking forward to the jazz lunch in the river restaurant and we were not disappointed. we looked out over the river and the excitement of the marathon.we started with an amouse bouche a small bloody mary was delicious and the king prawn starter had lovely flavours. my sister had the roast beef which she said was the best beef she had ever tasted. mycchicken caesar salad was fabulous. we had coffee and petit fours with a congratulatory message on the delivery plate as it was my sisters significant birthday. | the opulence of the hotel was something i have not experienced before, it was magnificent! the service was excellent and not obtrusive. we could not fault it. we would love to visit again when we have another special day to celebrate.'''",2
The Lanesborough,'''i had meal in a private room with some of my husband business colleagues. | felt welcome right from the start. i had to arrive on my own and i was greeted very nicely by the doormen and then shown exactly where i had to go. we had drinks first and i asked for tap water (being told to avoid mineral water due to kidney stones) and one of the waiters made sure my water glass was constantly filled throughout the evening. | the food was lovely especially the apple pie/tart for dessert. | the staff were very attentive and food excellent. would definitely return here.''',2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''we staryed at this hotel last weekend as we had lots of things to do in london and thought an overnight stay somewhere would be beneficial. we booked this as it was on a deal through lastminute.com and were glad we did. | it is ideally situated a short walfk from liverpool street station and as it is in the city it was quiet at the weekend which meant a decent nights sleep was easily obtained. the reception desk staff are very friendly and helpful - we could leave our bags at the hotel after we checked out as we were going round some places as part of open london and did not want to drag a case along with us. | only (slight) downside was at breakfast - we had to ask for our tea and coffee a couple of times as it keprt on being forgotten as was the toast we ordered. but those are just a couple of minor niggles. | we would definitely stay here again (especially as there is a great cocktail bar just round the corner near the guldhall!!).''',2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we were in for tree nights, i recommend this hotel. well placed and very kind staff. the breakfast is very good. the bar is confortable with a terrace to smoke with furnishing and outdoor stoves. in short , a good choice to live a few days. for long stays it is a little narrow. | |'''",2
The Savoy,"'''if you have ever wondered what is really 5* then this is hotel is it. some things may seem obvious i.e. they know you name on arrival, and make you comfortable straight away by not having to wait in queues. the surroundings are ""faded glory"" that have not faded, all impeccable condition. the staff are not distracted and are continually available, with each member seeming to know you personally, (it was our wedding anniversary) the food was individually made and with the finest ingredients, particularly the meats, including the vegetables which were in season and fresh. there is a resident chocolatier who demonstrates the making of all the sweets and confectionary, a superb touch. | all in all, a wonderful 5 star experience'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we stayed 3 nights. the rooms are a bit small but they are fine and we were expecting them to be small so no problem. everyone is lovely - we got a fantastic welcome and we found each member of staff went out their way to be helpful and pleasant. valentina who serves at breakfast was so nice and we had great chats with her. there was a nice waiter who took time to help us plan running routes, too. i absolutely loved the apples at reception - they are the nicest apples i have ever had! breakfast was fantastic - a huge buffet of wonderful things to eat - i could have eaten the apple cake all day. you could also order things from a menu - my husband and father in law did this - but i was happy with the buffet - cake, cheeses, meats, chicken, breads etc and beautifully presented fruits. they also have lovely toiletries in their bathrooms. location is ideal and close to a few tube stations. we ate in the restaurant one night and i was a little disappointed so would not eat there again (although i know it gets great reviews so maybe we were just unlucky) i will definitely stay here again'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we went for lunch and last month and what a delight the food was very nice and the staff very friendly, | great portions the duck heart was simply beautiful | the building has great character with great toilets with a powder room space | we would go back again and the lunch time menu was more than a good price'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i stayed in this hotel for one week. i chose it because of its price and location. it was the cheaper in this area. i had a single room with share bathroom and toilet. the place was very nice, clean and comfortable. i have to highlight that the breakfast was very abundant: egg (one or two), bacon and bread. sometimes it even included a sausage, some tomato slices, and cheese. the staff was also very friendly and always willing to help the visitors to plan their trips. | the only thing that i disliked was the noise coming from gower street. i you close the windows it gets less noisy, but i like to have the windows open. so, if you are sensitive to the noise, you should ask for a room that faces the backyard. | i would definitively recommend this hotel!!!'''",2
"Bulgari Hotel, London",'''the bulgari hotel is very classy and elegant. the service is great and the food and drinks in the bar restaurant are excellent. it has a very relaxed atmosphere. the staff are attentive and you feel very welcome.''',2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''girlfriend and i stayed 8 nights in february 2013. the strongest point of this hotel for us was the service. everyone was very well trained, so consistenly we got above average service. which is very nice because you feel welcomed and at home. | the second characteristic that stood out, during our stay, was the great location. shopping was next door, with harvey nichols in front and harrods five minutes walk away. location was very important because the cold weather in february is aggresive and you do not want to wander around too much ""looking"" for places. also, knightsbridge is considered the most exclusive and upscale area in town, meaning that you can always get out, and very closely, you will have a high concentration of the better restaurants, cafes, and ""posh"" things to do in town. | the food and the mandarin is also another great point to this hotel. bar boloud is owned by one of the top chefs of new york, daniel boloud and it is a great place to lunch, considering the quality. the other restaurant in the hotel is dinner by heston. another, great value really, considering it is the same chef of fat duck, among the top 10 restaurants in the world. | the weakest point is, with no doubt, the fact that the hotel facilities (except for the common areas) are run-down (guest rooms) and that if you are looking for a sleek, modern, (such as recently remodeled sofitels, for example) you will not find this here. the hotel decoration is very classy, a bit too much, but tolerable. be aware of the size of the rooms, it is no mistery that there is a strong corelation with high real-state value locations and smaller rooms, do not forget you are paying for being where the action is, so if space its important for you (we travel with 4 suitcases) make sure you check the sizes of the rooms, since is one of your selection criterion. we read comments of the sizes of the rooms, so we picked the second option in size and it went really well. we were on the atic on the nineth floor.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''my partner and i booked the apex wall for the evening of our friends' wedding as it was walking distance from their chosen venue. | we were not disappointed. | this hotel is well presented, with nice, fresh decoration throughout. the rooms are a good size, with excellently sized beds and nice furnishings. the bathroom is well decorated with a walk in shower and separate good sized bath... making the whole room feel that little bit more luxurious. the bedroom is easy to enjoy too, with comfortable furnishings, making it a great space to spend time in, perfect for having that little bit of peace and quiet in the city centre. | lots of freebies including tea and coffee, hot chocolate, pringles and biscuits and also complementary shower gel, shampoo and conditioner and body lotion. really lovely touches which make the whole stay that little bit extra special. | if we need to be in this part of the city, we would definitely stay here again and we would recommend you do too!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this was our second visit to the mondrian. the first was a little disappointing as we were disturbed by some other guests on a number of occasions throughout the night. however, the manager handled it very well the next morning and invited us back to stay with his support for our next booking. he was extremely accommodating and our room was outstanding with great views and very quiet throughout the night. breakfast was also delicious and i was pleasantly surprised by the vegetarian sausages hat arrived with my room service order. it was a shame that rumpus was closed and that room service was a little pricey but you would expect this from a hotel of this standard. would highly recommend and plan to return.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we went for a family/business celebration, drinks in the american bar followed by long lunch in the river restaurant's hidden private dining area. what more could you ask for, location, style, grandeur and just that feeling of occasion. just what we needed. | i really cannot fault anything the service was great so was the food. with regard to the food, where can you eat in such surroundings for 27.50, nowhere i know. | whiles its not in ""my part"" of london it is now my destination of choice over the more obvious green park/park lane venues. | go, relax, enjoy it a nicer pace at the savoy!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''stayed at the apex london wall hotel for a week when attending a conference in the area. nice, clean hotel, friendly staff, decent breakfast. we chose the hotel mostly due to the location, close to the conference venue, so for us the location was very good. if you are in london for pleasure and fun, i am guessing the location is less optimal. since it is in the middle of a business district, there are not many restaurants or pubs in the neighbourhood. on the other hand, if you walk some 20 minutes you can get to much more populated areas. | the view form my room on the 5th floor was pretty much just the opposite office building, but i did not expect much more. might be other rooms with better view. | all in all, good hotel when in london for business, but i probably would not choose it for a family weekend.'''",2

The Lanesborough,"'''just had a wonderful overnight stay at the lanesborough and it was wonderful. | the style of the hotel was lovely, we think regency, and so peaceful. | all the staff were attentive but not over the top. from the door men who took our bags from us on arrival (and at midnight when we came back from an event laden down with goodies) to the very friendly receptionist (jamie or janie we think her name was) who booked up in before showing us to our room. then we were greeted by the butler eve who explained their service which included a complementary clothes pressing if needed (we took advantage as my dress shirt had not travelled well). | we enjoyed lunch at celeste and several cocktails in the library bar. | all in all a wonderful stay, thank you.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''during a girls trip to london and the surrounding areas, we booked a 9 day stay at this hotel. we were a bit nervous since we knew that if we did not like the hotel, we would be stuck. however, we could not have been more pleased with the stay. the hotel was clean, the rooms well appointed, and the hotel was kind enough to give us adjoining rooms that that we would not have to navigate up and down the halls to meet up. the breakfast was perfect for us. they had a great selection of items so that each one of us found something (or many things) that we enjoyed. the location is wonderful. it was across front he victoria and albert museum, very close to a tube station, a short walk to some great nightclubs, and a short walk to harrods. i would not hesitate to stay here again. the service was friendly, the rooms were perfect for our needs and the location was great!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we spent a long weekend in london and decided to go for a centrally located hotel. so this was the first time we have been in the savoy and it was a great experience / can definetly recommend. despite the size of the hotel, the atmosphere and attention of staff was phenomenal and very personell. attention to detail and the well-being of the guest is a clear priority. the rooms are large and spacious and nicely decorated in traditional english style, yet all the modern features you would expect from such a hotel. at night we paid a visit to the champagne bar which had a live performance with band. very nice setting and great cocktails. the breakfast is also an experience it itself in the beautiful setting. will definetly come back. only drawback like in many hotels is the surcharge one has to pay for high speed internet access.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i have been going to london fairly regularly two or three times a year for the past ten years or so, so as you can imagine i have seen my fair share of b&amp;bs and hotels, and i must say the ridgemount is a real gem! | the fact that it is managed and run as a family business really makes a difference. i had been trying to book here for ages, but always found it fully booked; finally this time i managed to book enough in advance and found a place...and i am so glad i did! | when we arrived, we were given a choice between a room on the first floor and one in the basement. we choose the one in the basement, overlooking the garden, and i am so glad we did, as it was really quiet, you could hardly hear a noise, even from the other rooms within the building. the room was spotlessly clean, with a recently refurbished bathroom and plenty of shelves and storage space. | breakfast is freshly made (eggs, bacon and something on the side, such as beans or sausage) and yummy. staff at breakfast were always cheerful and smiling, which was a definite bonus, as i have encountered plenty of grumpy staff over the years. | the owners are very nice people, with always a word for you when you go out in the morning, if you need help with directions, suggestions about sights to see etc. | there is no lift, it being an 18th century building, but we were helped with our luggage both on arrival and when we left. | finally, there is free wi-fi available, plus two computers for guest use in the lounge. | rates are very reasonable and i will definitely stay there again when i am in london!'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we chose to stay here for 6 nights in november because of 2 key considerations - the location and the price. the location is in bloomsbury, very close to goodge street station (northern line, great for visits to leicester square for us homesick asians) and within walkable distance to tottenham court station (even in the cold). | room was basic and it was really no frills which was not surprising (we paid only 90+ pounds a night for a room with attached toilet) but i have to admit a little disappointing especially since we had just come from a delightful frill-full b&amp;b, hotel ceilidh-donia (75 pounds a night) in edinburgh. but no shower gel, shampoo in your room at hotel ridgemount so remember to bring your own. | breakfast was bacon, egg, tomato and sometimes sausage, cereal, tea or coffee and orange juice everyday. the breakfast servers were very courteous and friendly, but do not expect variety in food choices. and please do not make the nice servers rattle off what is available that day. it is the same everyday, no point asking. | the only sour point about our stay was that we got a room on the ground floor (which was ok because there is no elevator so it is such a chore to drag your heavy luggage if any up the stairs) and the room was near the main door so everyday in the mornings and late nights (sometimes) we could hear the doorbell buzz. it was rather annoying but we were hardly in the room and i wear ear plugs to sleep so we did not ask for a change of room. if you are a light sleeper, take note. | the elderly mrs rees (i assume) was very kind and helpful. the hotel also has plenty of maps, a lounge with computers for your use. overall, a pleasant stay but do not manage your expectations. it is budget accommodation in a great location, nothing more.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''the savoy has to be my favorite hotel anywhere. the staff here is the most caring, helpful and polite. the welcome you receive when arriving continues throughout the lobby, reception, room attendants, and restaurant staff. the rooms are immaculate, food delicious and i will repeat... the staff cannot do more for you. | only con: one of the girls in reception, she was very good technically, but her people skills were lacking. just not the person you want to get for a first impression of the savoy'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''i stayed here for 3 nights in march and then 2 nights just last weekend with my children. well i have to say that it was faultless. all the staff were attentive, chatty and pleasent. from the reception desk to the room service team. most recently we stayed in rooms 240/241 which are 2 ajoinning rooms. well they are just excellent. they were large with a long corridor joining the rooms. well appointed and so comfortable. what more can you say.. we all had a fabulous stay..'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''after much research we decided to spend 3 nights at the corinthia in march. wow! i am a pretty big hotel snob, but loved just about everything about this true five star hotel. we checked in late after the train from paris. check in was smooth and friendly and attentive. we were shown to our upgraded executive room and i was afraid it was too small for us with a roll away bed. they worked hard to find us something else, but i was desperate for a balcony so it limited our options. i did not choose to pay for an upgrade to a much larger suite and as it turned out, the room assigned was fine for us, even perfect! when a hotel and its rooms are well designed it makes all of the difference in the world. this was a perfect example. the executive room is not huge but just right. the room also had a little balcony that overlooked their beautiful and quiet courtyard. i should add that i loved the design and decor. just so pretty. the bathroom is as fabulous as the pictures. great double vanity with perfect lighting and huge tub with tv. there was a separate shower and room with toilet and bidet. soaps and products for all necessities. (serious pet peeve of mine). | i am quite particular, and during our check in had a lot of requests. everything was taken care of quickly, efficiently and with a smile. from the extra blankets, to the portable fan, to the welcoming stuffed animal that was so sweetly given to my very grateful son, it was really quite impressive. special thanks to the evening housekeeping gentlemen. turndown was a treat nightly. wifi was excellent as well. | the location cannot be beat. | near the eye, trafalgar, piccadilly, covent garden, soho buckingham palace etc. all within walking distance. | breakfast was a highlight! i love fancy hotel buffet breakfasts and this was one of my favorites. huge selection plus a great made to order menu. yogurt, cereals, fruit, delicious belgian waffles, eggs, fish and even asian delicacies. the room and service were just wonderful and my son loved the very special hot chocolate with marshmallows and accoutrement. it certainly kept us going for most of the day. the concierge was nice and helpful. the doorman and bellman were great as well. | our only complaint was the room service dinner we had the last night. the pizza was not edible, an indonesian dish with dried out chicken and shrimp with undercooked rice was really bad and the rest was mediocre at best. my kid's pasta was just fine but for 85's and everything else being so so wonderful, i was really disappointed. | i do not want to end this review on a bad note as i loved our experience there and have already recommended this hotel to many. it ticked almost every box and really felt like a true five star wow hotel! with luck, we will definitely be back!'''",2
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''this hotel is my favorite hotel . the room is beautiful , i love the marble clad floor that provide heat in the toilet . the food was amazing but i think the breakfast should be include in the room charge. the internet is very fast and the service is marvelous . the rolls royce ghost is amazing . i used it for 3 or 4 time and i am in love with the car . the driver were very nice and a guy who opened the door for me to the hotel and to the car he so kind . after all this is a very good hotel in london and we will come back again for sure .'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed 2 nights here free as part of a british airways deal. it is right across from the victoria and albert museum and a short walk to wonderful restaurants in south kensington (bibendum, racine, kwality india). the staff was very friendly, there was free internet access, a terrific breakfast and a health club adjoining (available for a slight fee.) our room was not huge or fancy but had a powerful shower and was quite clean if somewhat dowdy and worn. (the mattresses were firm, though) we then paid for some additional nights because our daughter is living nearby and the location was so convenient. again, we booked through british airways and got a wonderful promotional deal - i think it amounted to about $145 a night! in london!! this is not a ""romantic"" getaway but if you do not plan on being in the room much and just want a nice place to stay with lovely staff, i would highly recommend the rembrandt.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''i did not stay or eat in the restaurant, but did come into contact with a number of staff members. the meeting was in one of the conference rooms and had the standard fare of croissants and muffins. sadly nothing more interesting but that was in the hands of the host, not the hotel. although i did not try one, the muffins looked spectacular. the urn of hotel coffee (usually like mud in most hotels) was a tasty blend. for once, i could have drunk a 2nd cup. | the staff were uniformly charming and friendly. i had no idea where to go. like quality hotels everywhere, there is no obvious check-in or place to make enquiries. staff quickly appeared when i stood briefly looking lost. my walking stick was immediately spotted and i was escorted to the lift. coming out a woman was approaching the stairs with a small overnight case (a pilot case with an extending handle). someone rushed forward to help and carry it. the doorman was later on station, not distracted, and called a cab for me. this was a step up on claridges which i reviewed recently after a lunch. the staff were not as spontaneously smiling, helpful and cheery so this was a really good experience. on that comparison, and my limited exposure, it is nevertheless worth an extra star on claridges'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''stayed at the rembrandt for 4 nights in london prior to spending time in the cotswolds. this is a great hotel, with a very reasonable price for london. we had a lovely, beautifully decorated room (a no-cost upgrade by the management to their ""club"" level). the room was very well appointed, desk, couch, king bed, well equipped bath and lovely decorations. we only dined after our late evening arrival in the bar, and this was tasty with excellent service. breakfasts, included in our room price, offered an expansive buffet. the concierge was friendly and helpful. the hotel is in a great location, less than 5 minute. 3 block walk from a piccadilly line tube stop. but our favorite feature was the free smart phone provided in our room. we could take it with us to use it map features, be able to access information about places we were going while on the move, and -- best of all -- free phone calls within the uk and to the us (among more than 100 other countries). this alone saved us a substantial amount, making the overall price of our stay in london even more reasonable.'''",2

The Lanesborough,"'''my experience of staying at the lanesborough hotel can only be described as experiencing what a hotel can be when it is at the very top of its game and at its finest. | i stayed at the lanesborough for one night along with my mother on the day of my 21st birthday as we were in london to enjoy the day and celebrate. from the moment we arrived at the door we were greeted with style and class by the expert doormen and porter team who swiftly showed us through to reception where the delightful lilly took us through a very swift and easy check in experience. throughout our stay (and based upon my previous experiences visiting the lanesborough and other hotels) my mother and i both noted how excellent the doormen were- certainly some of the finest in london and always willing to welcome you by name back into the hotel and provide a cheery goodbye when exiting. as the first and last point of call when at the hotel these men have got their craft down to a perfection. | we were delighted to find upon check in that as it was a birthday celebration and there was availability we had been upgraded from the executive room to a premier room, the hotel having been able to match my exact decor specifications in the room (special thanks for mr shard for taking down these details at the point of reservation)- i could not have asked for a room closer to my taste! upon entering the room i was greeted by a delightful birthday cake (due to a very minor issue with it however we were not able to finish the cake but from what we did try it was delicious) so a special thanks goes to ms bursfords guest services team for this wonderful detail . | our room was extremely spacious, very light and airy with all the in room facilities helping make our stay effortless. the bathroom was beautifully appointed with the softest towels of any hotel my mother or i have visited. it is quite easy to miss many of the bathroom features and any slight little issues i could even think about raising could have been solved by the press of the 'housekeeping' button next to the butler call button. we choose not to do so as we found solutions to them ourselves so they really are not worth mentioning. in the morning we took breakfast, complimentary due to an offer whereby accepting a complimentary years membership of 'leading hotels of the world' (which will no doubt prove most useful!) meant receiving a complimentary breakfast, in our room. the service was excellent with the trolley arriving perfectly presented and set up by the team members with all host of delights available through the 'lanesborough breakfast' menu option. there was a minor issue given that we tried to split the times of two breakfasts after having initially ordered them to arrive together and the second ended up arriving early but i put this down to my not having been clear at the time i was amending the order, as it was i was happy to receive the breakfast earlier than i had planned anyway. while i dined elsewhere in the night my mother dined through the in room dining menu, ordered through the control hub tablet system in place in all rooms, and was extremely impressed that not only did the team who delivered it ensure it was set up well in room but they also were aware she had been to the spa and hence provided bottled water for rehydration and had the turn down service rescheduled so she could enjoy dining in peace- this was a consistent feature of our visit where needs were anticipated by staff before they were mentioned by ourselves. her only comment was that she did not find it easier to find how to specify the delivery time through ordering on the tablet system (which strangely was easy to specify when ordering breakfast) but as one can order via the butlers or via the phone system this should not present guests with a problem. | the butler service every hotel guest at the lanesborough receives was second to none. it was wonderful that upon calling the butler to help set up our wi-fi and opening the room door the truly delightful bettina was there to wish me a happy birthday with an unrivalled smile and cheer. our interactions with bettina throughout our stay were perhaps the real highlights of the whole stay as positivity simply exuded from her and fill us both with smiles every time. if i am completely honest i was at first unsure what to think having painted the picture in my mind and had been eagerly anticipating experiencing the traditional gentlemen butler, but bettina surpassed all expectations and was a real delight who we cannot thank enough for making our visit special. with the press of a button on her system bettina, anticipating our needs following a passing comment about our train time, secured late check out for us as the room was not needed immediately so we did not need to vacate it as early as planned- this was very greatly appreciated and made life so much easier. all elements of the butler service really were first class. we did not sample every standard service the butlers offer (e.g. the drawing of a bath and unpacking) as we were traveling light and were only resident for a single night but my freshly shined shoes had never been so gleaming following sending them off to the butlers. | both my mother and i visited the brand new lanesborough club and spa in the in the evening and afternoon respectively. upon my own visit ernest and mohammed the two spa butlers were as helpful as anyone could be and always made sure to keep me engaged and interested and answer any questions i had and i understand this was the same for my mother. one should always ask for directions to the new spa as it can be quite a warren of passageways to access the lift but the concierge team are adept at guiding guests through to the lift. the facilities at the new spa were first class, the only thing that was not operational on my visit was the post sauna ice trough which was awaiting repair though this was working in the female thermal suite. the hydropool, perhaps the star attraction of the new spa was one of my favourite experiences and was itself almost like a treatment given how relaxing it was. the array of products on offer in the changing rooms to use pre and post spa were also first class. i had a spur of the moment decision to try and book a pedicure when i arrived at the spa but sadly the painting room was fully booked during the free time i had, my fault for not booking ahead, so i would advise anyone wishing to have a treatment to let the team know at the very least 24 hours in advance to ensure the best availability and avoid disappointment. | while i was dining elsewhere my mother enjoyed first rate hospitality at the library bar, i know from having visited this and left reviews for the library bar before that it is a first class establishment and perhaps the cosiest in london. the team there went to exceptional efforts to ensure she was well looked after and entertained while she awaited my arrival and when i did arrive they had a special little cake prepared with a candle to say happy birthday and two glasses of house champagne- they could not have been more friendly and i shall certainly make the library bar my bar of choice when in london. | this is clearly a hotel at the top of its game and mr gelardi has every right to be proud of his exceptional staff. i would always advise anyone looking to stay at this hotel or dine there to deal with the hotel directly (i experienced, due to a matter not directly related to my stay but related to the new lanesborough website, prior to my stay dealing with the parent company, the oetker collection, and found while they were polite the response times were slow on a matter where i provided them with what i would deem great assistance to them rather than vice versa. i was slightly indignant over the lack of acknowledgement for the recommendations i gave them which they acted upon but did not reply to this was put down to their efforts in dealing with a crisis elsewhere in the collection. all the same i must comment no such thing was comparable to the instantaneous service levels lanesborough itself hence i would recommend always going to the lanesborough as your first point of call over the collection itself or booking agencies). | i conclude by saying that while the lanesborough might be my first london 'grande damme' hotel resident visit, it is by no means the first 'grande damme' non-resident visit and having had the pleasure of being inside the other hotels it is quite common to feel, following the attention the staff give you, that you wish you could be resident in the hotel full time, only at the lanesborough however have i experienced the feeling where i wished i was not just resident there but actually working there, such was the dedication, good spirit, passion and sheer attention to detail of all the staff involved. i will be recommending the lanesborough to all.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we enjoyed our 3 night stay at rhodes hotel. we stayed in the twin room on the main level next to the office. i was afraid it would be noisy, but it was fine ... no noise issues. though the room was super tiny and the bathroom even smaller, based on the price, it is what we expected. the room was clean and the bathroom seems to have been remodeled recently as everything was very modern. the beds were super comfy! there was a huge, flatscreen tv in the room which was somewhat comical for how small the space was. the breakfast (coffee, tea, toast, yogurt, fruit, etc) was good and the staff was very nice. you can order a full english breakfast for extra, but he would also just make me poached eggs for free. the hotel is definately dated in the common areas and shows some wear and tear, but it is clean and the staff is nice. they will also hold your luggage for you (though it is not in a locked room, but just in the reception area). the location is very convenient to paddington station (maybe a 5 min walk max). we did not try any of the restaurants nearby as they seemed to be typical ""train station"" fare, but with the tube so close that is not really an issue. they also arranged a car service for us to heathrow for 35 pounds, which was very reasonable for more than 1 person vs. taking the train. if you are looking for a budget b&amp;b in a quiet area, i would not hesitate to recommend rhodes hotel.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''this was my first business trip to london and i found the location to be very convenient. the staff was very attentive and helpful in terms of making suggestions for dining as well as mapping out locations to my meetings/theatre performances.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''i booked a double room for seven days for an impromptu trip to london. the hotel was | very clean, very comfortable, staff were great, included breakfast was very good and overall the hotel was everything we could have asked for in a hotel of that category. | the location is excellent right across from the v&amp;a museum and surrounded by nice coffee shops and casual restaurants. | bus service right out the door to major london locations.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''the welcoming/check-in really is noteworthy. | the hotel is historic in ways that are celebrated in a fun way (my room had a framed photograph of tony curtis and janet leigh, at a table at the savoy with orson welles, and a caption saying that janet leigh often stayed at the savoy, and frequently asked for this room.) | for service, the savoy is peerless. | the location is great. | one time i had a room with poor wireless connectivity, but that is a fairly minor issue.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this is a modern stylish hotel that is brilliantly situated, with wonderfully appointed rooms, a great restaurant and great bar, and fantastic service. | situated at the southern end of blackfriars bridge in the old sea containers position, it is in a great location to walk along (in either direction) the totally renewed and upgraded south bank with its many bars and restaurants. a short walk over the bridge and you reach the st pauls cathedral area (and there are great views of st pauls, especially at night). | the rooms are extremely well appointed, with a mini bar and crystal glasses that is 10/10. the walk in showers are also beautifully appointed. | although the bar is a different concession it is trendy and chic, popular with the after-work crowd.'''",2
The Savoy,'''went for pre christmas cocktails with my daughter's to the american bar at the savoy - what a treat! so sophisticated and elegant from the tickling ivories to subdued lighting. as for the cocktails - mine was a negroni - possibly the best in town and the champagne cocktails were great too! nibbles were refreshed several times - it was pre supper so we were hungry!. gorgeous time to visit too as the christmas tree in the foyer was so chic from the bronze dogs playing among the presents to the elegance of the colour scheme which was picked up over the fireplace and around the foyer - wonderful service - quite expensive but worth every penny to in such glamorous surroundings.''',2
The Savoy,"'''we stayed at this wonderful hotel recently. it is location on the strand is perfect for sightseeing and there are lots of restaurants and theatres very close by.the staff are extremely attentive polite and immaculately dressed. at check in we were given an upgrade to a luxury deluxe king room with a partial river view. the room was not ready so were taken to the american bar and given complimentary cocktails. we were personally escorted to our room on the 8th floor by a member of the reception staff. our luggage was in the room waiting for us! the bedroom was very large and had all the amenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel in london . after the theatre and dinner we returned to our room to find slippers by the bed and the bedding had been turned down. how many hotels do that these days!! | we had a most comfortable nights sleep , the pillows were wonderful and the mattress was really really comfy. the breakfast in the restaurant was included in the room rate it was delicious. the breakfast menu covered most people's requirements, we had the savoy english breakfast yummy. i cannot honestly find fault with this hotel the whole experience was amazing, yes it is expensive but would highly recommend a visit.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''had a fantastic two night stay here last week. tucked away in a nice location very near to moorgate and liverpool street station's so excellent for public transport. staff were very warm, welcoming, friendly and helpful from the moment i arrived until the moment i left. upgraded to a junior suite and it was a great decision. a decent sized living area followed by a great sized bedroom with a big comfy bed, lots of space and the bathroom was great and spacious also. the seperate bath and shower were great and the complimentary snacks and toiletries in the room were a lovely touch. | will definitely be staying here on any future visits to london!'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''classic, well maintained boutique hotel in south kensington, close to residential neighbourhoods around you, museums, shopping, hyde park, restaurants and theatres; we were across the street from the victoria and albert museum. my husband and i had 3 lovely nights last week at the rembrandt; a beautiful classic building, the rooms were well appointed, clean, friendly staff, the conceierge is very helpful and gives great advice on what to see and experience. daily breakfasts offered many choices of hot and cold plated food, quality ingredients, customer friendly staff.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''we recently stayed at the savoy hotel in london. it was a gift purchased for our recent anniversary. | we had a wonderful time and cannot recommend the hotel enough. its art deco interior is stunning and reeks of luxury. booking in and out was simple and the staff were extremely helpful, polite but friendly. our room was lovely with a very comfortable bed and plenty of stotarge if needed. we had a leisurely lunch in the restaurant and an excellent breakfast the next day complete with silver teapots and china cups - a real treat! | the location for shopping and theatres is ideal and you are next to the thames if you fancy a walk or jog. | the only negatives were: we requested refreshments in our room on arrival, these never appeared. our bill was incorrect by a large amount of money. someone had quoted our room number for lunch which we never had. they adhusted this but clearly someone had had an expensive meal for free! as they do not ask for a signature the system appears open to abuse. | on the positive side the hotel send us a lovely chocolate cake decorated with happy aniversay to our room foc which was a lovely touch and more than the waldorf astoria managed earlier this year. | we are planning a return trip in the spring and thoroughly looking forward to it.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this was my first stay at the corinthia and i do not know if i will ever stay at another hotel here in the uk. it is absolutely amazing in every way from | the service, to the room decor and the location. this hotel made my business trip a truly pleasurable experience and i will definitely be staying here again!'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''my boyfriend took me here for a surprise for our 2 year anniversary and although it was nice it was not amazing as you would expect a 5* hotel to be. | the rooms are just glorified premier inn rooms and the spa is non existent!! just some seats to lie on with a little puddle of water in the middle!! | the room we stayed in was tiny. i did however really like having brunch in the restaurant and the decor outside the hotel rooms is interesting. | the staff were nice but i would not say majorly exceptional. | overall nice but not for a majorly special occassion i am dissapointed we did not stay elsewhere and i know my bf wished he would used his money elsewhere.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i think this was my 10th stay at the corinthia and it never disappoints. it scores high on all levels for me - the atmosphere, the staff, the rooms, the food, the spa - all tremendous. the spa is reason enough to choose corinthia over most other options - it is magnificent.'''",2

"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i had a very enjoyable stay at the xenia, having chosen it based on online reviews. the hotel did not disappoint. the staff were unfailingly cheerful, pleasant, efficient and helpful. breakfast buffet was substantial (i had the continental) with a great variety of foods to choose from (i loved the smoked salmon) and courteous and prompt service. my room, which was a standard double, was small but included everything you needed, with a clean and modern bathroom with a great shower. the bed was very comfortable indeed and the location was great. walking distance to many venues, and near the earls court tube. definitely would stay there again.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed here for 3 nights.the lobby is clean and *smells* amazing (you can actually buy the scent in your room to take home). i would compare this property to a w hotel, same vibe. rooms are small by american standards but easily adaptable and clean. showers are roomy and updated. check-in staff were friendly. hotel is vibrant with energy, the lounge area / bar is great for a cocktail or looking out to the thames river and city. | note, there was construction going on during our stay in november, we could hear this during the mornings/day time, even on a higher floor. | note, the room doors slam very loudly, if you are on a busy floor expect to hear doors shutting constantly. this started to get pretty annoying by our last day. | location is great; right on the queens walk and located close to the blackfriars metro station and bus stops. nice neighborhood areas to explore nearby on foot. if you are up for walking, you can hightail it to the main 'tourist' attractions via the queens walk.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''november 2014 review: | pros: | -too new to be haunted (7 weeks new) | - clean, modern/contemporary, hip, and chic | -10 minute walk from the cut (street with restaurants and bars) | cons: ugh. | -staffed needs to be re-trained (just about everyone) | -taxi drivers and uber drivers have no clue to where this place is because it is too new | tips: | -do not walk along upper ground, walk along the water (south bank) | -waterloo station is confusing due to many entrances and exits. get off at embankment and walk across the bridge and along the southbank waterfront. enter the hotel through the restaurant. it feels safer than upper ground at night time, especially if you are alone. it is about 15 minutes if you have the extra time. | -you can walk to almost any place from here (national gallery, tate, eye, cathedral, and yes, the financial district). allow yourself the 20 minutes, it is great exercise. | so here is what happened to why i feel the staff needs to be re-trained. i had a looong day and got back to my room at 4pm and i walked in on housekeeping. fine, i used the toilet and waited in the lobby for 45 minutes so she can clean up. i get back up there and she is not finished. i politely tell her to leave and she let us me know she needs to put on a pillowcase. i let her know that i do not need the pillowcase and she can leave. finally, i can nap before heading to dinner. 15minutes into my nap and she knocks on the door to give me a pillowcase. ugh. fast forward 20 minutes, and a woman knocks on the door to ask if i am pleased with my stay. ugh. fast forward another 30 minutes and a guy knocks on my door with my dry cleaning, very expensive dry cleaning. | so many disturbances in such a short period of time, and when you are trying to nap..... you do not expect disturbances after 3pm in general. leave a note if you are curious about service. | would i stay here again? sure, for the right price | dec/jan 2015 review: | fast forward a month. staff still needs to be retrained. service is inconsistent, but overall a not-so-bad experience. | what bothered me most: being bothered 3x during the day by engineering, person checking the mini bar, and housekeeping during later afternoon hrs. all would come at the same hour. | also, they need to change the outlets in the bathroom or provide a converter. their own hairdryer does not work and you have to use it any place other than the bathroom. not a big deal, but a little bothersome if another person is sleeping. | if you are looking for hip and chic, this is the place for you.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''ideally situated for shopping and sightseeing, 1st class service very polite staff, very clean and well furnished hotel. our room was small but had an outside balcony with seating. will definitely book here again.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''room was not huge but a fair size given the price and the location of this hotel. the room was modern and clean. the staff were friendly and allowed me to keep my bike in the room. | as i had to leave before 5am we missed breakfast but staff offered to make me fresh coffee which was a nice gesture. | being off the main roads it was unbelievably quiet for a central city location.''',2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i booked a single night at the corinthia for my wife's birthday and i am so happy i did. absolutely 100% the best hotel i have ever stayed at in london by a country mile. | i do not tend to write reviews for hotels when i stay a single night as i think it is difficult to judge something over such a short time, especially considering my overnight stays are usually just somewhere to sleep, but we both did not want to leave the corinthia and it completely deserves a glowing review! | i contacted the reservations department prior to our trip to advise them it was my wife's birthday and i wanted to have some flowers and champagne in the room on arrival and also arrange some spa treatments for her. this was handled very professionally and with minimal fuss over email as the spa, the florist and the reservations department all contacted me and confirmed my requests. | when we arrived the porter took our bags with a smile and we checked in with no fuss. we were escorted to our room, which was ready for us and on arrival given a brief overview of the safety deposit box etc. soon after arriving our bags arrived. the room was stunning. a real treat with fluffy thick feeling carpets, woods and marble in the bathroom with all modern comms that you would expect (great shower and bath). the flowers and champagne i had ordered were beautifully arranged and they had even provided a little cake and a card wishing my wife a happy birthday! a nice touch. | after going to the theatre in the evening, we decided to stop in the bassoon bar for a few cocktails. the waitress was very attentive and although she got my 1st order wrong (she misheard me and bought the wrong beer for our 1st round), it really was not an issue as we had table service and my wife loved the bubblegum cocktails. very funky/cool place with a nice vibe. | the bed was really comfortable to sleep in and we had a nice lay in on sunday. the other amazing thing about this hotel... 24 hour check in/out. we slept in quite late on the sunday as we got back late, but there was no rush to be out the hotel by 11 or 12 as with every other hotel. when we checked in they asked what time we would approximately be checking out and as we had a day in the spa planned we did not want to leave until around 6 or 7pm. this was no problem at all and it was so nice being able to get up when we wanted and have a base for the day we were leaving! | my wife had 2 hours in the spa having a facial and a massage and she described it as one of the best she has ever had (and she has quite a few). she said the attention to detail and advice offered during the whole treatment was really good. whilst my wife was in the the spa i decided to go for a run and concierge was very helpful in providing me with a jogging route up down past buckingham palace and around the serpentine in hyde park. i then joined my wife and we relaxed in the hot pool and sauna, before grabbing some freshly squeezed juices from the spa lounge. after an hour or so we could wander back to our room where we got ready to check out, but took our time and did not feel rushed thanks to the fact we could check out whenever! | this hotel is simply amazing and the little touches are what make all the difference. the fact every time we walked into the reception, the staff addressed us by name (i am assuming they have some machine that picks up something from our key card and displays it on the computer...either that or they have rainman like abilities for remembering a face!) the flowers were wrapped so we could take them home and nothing seemed too much trouble. the doormen all helping with our cases. the hotel feels very grand and oozes luxury with the think carpets, clean glass and fresh smells from the wooden floors etc. | the location of the hotel is also great for visiting the sights on london just down the road from trafalgar square and buckingham palace etc. | i am running the marathon in april and this will hopefully be the hotel i stay at. we loved everything about it and cannot wait to be back and i cannot recommend this hotel enough. | thanks to everyone at the corinthia for a perfect weekend.'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed for 6 nights in an executive king in june. this is the 7th time we have stayed at this hotel and over the years have been in standard, executive and club rooms. the club room is very nice but for the money i would highly recommend the executive room. this was the first time we have had a room facing thurloe place. our room had french doors which opened only partially to a small balcony. i enjoyed the view and fresh air and was surprised once the doors were closed there was no noise from traffic. there was plenty of room (for london) for both our our huge suitcases. the closet was big enough for hanging clothes, storing our shopping bags and a few pair of shoes and that is with the bottom being taken up with the room safe. the bathroom was a decent size with deep tub and strong shower. | breakfast in the dining room is buffet style with a large selection of hot and cold foods. we had breakfast delivered to the room twice which was really great on those mornings when we had early days planned. there is an atm machine in the lobby which was very convenient, and wifi in the room. the hotel is across from the victoria &amp; albert museum, a few blocks from harrods, a short walk to the south kensington tube station, and a really nice pedestrian area lined with cafes and restaurants. i cannot say enough about the staff and our stays here, it is my favorite place to stay in london!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''wow! from friendly staff to over-the-top fabulous fresh flowers (changed every day) this hotel is fabulous! the lounge area is so peaceful and stylish you will not want to leave! our room was fantastic and good value for central london - a separate bedroom, changing room and bathroom. the bathroom was amazing with a tv in the bath, separate shower room and separate wc. the spa is huge and very impressive. | with the location being only 5min walk from embankment tube it is location is also perfect. i cannot wait to go back!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''my wife and i have stayed at the savoy several times, both before and after the multi-hundred million dollar renovation in 2010. we have always been made to feel special. our visit this year was no different. we try to stay at the savoy either at the beginning or end of our travels through britain, either to help get us in the congenial british frame of mind for starting a great trip, or to celebrate the completion of one. this time we began our trip there, arriving after the long flight from los angeles. greeted by the smiling face of the doorman who has graced the entry for decades, we felt like we were returning to visit good friends. the rich wood paneling and striking paintings in the lobby set the tone for an exceptional experience. the new dcor sparkles with the black and white floor tiles leading past an immense vase of lavender orchids to the thames foyer and its large eye-catching gazebo. | upon arrival, we were led to the quiet reading room and settled in comfortable chairs by a desk to relax while being checked in. then shown to our immaculate room, we rested before dinner. we have stayed in rooms of both the art deco and the edwardian dcor, and found them both to be intriguing and pleasing to the eye. | on various trips, we have enjoyed outstanding meals at all the restaurants. this time we went around the corner to simpsons-in-the-stand for a traditionally classic and succulent dinner featuring their famous roasts. for a quick meal, we used to enjoy the caf above the entrance, where you could watch the comings and goings out the window. alas, it has been made into a room for private dining. however, breakfast in our room was still a special treat, and one of the choices on our bed and breakfast package. | this time we also missed seeing general manager kiaran macdonald. we had the good fortune to stay at the savoy the night of the grand reopening in 2010, when prince charles made an appearance, praising the exquisite renovations and remarking how much his grandmother, the late queen mother, had loved the savoy and the devoted staff. mr. macdonald went out of his way to greet us when we returned from a show late that night, as well as wish us safe journey very early the next morning when we departed. we were pleased that we received similar warm, friendly treatment from the staff this time. | for what the savoy has to offer, the pricey rates are to be expected. but if you track the special offers, you can find some attractive deals at times. its worth a splurge to experience this renowned london hotel. a history room on the second level plays videos of the glamorous hollywood stars of an earlier era that patronized the savoy. in the new savoy tea shop off the lobby, you can watch as the delectable savoy chocolates are made.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''was recommended to go here by a family friend. it was such a lovely treat. the room was a fair size with 2 beds, an ensuite bathroom, wardrobe, fan and tv et cetera. the maid was always asking if we needed anything. the breakfast was so good and i looked forward to it every morning. the staff there are so pleasant and always ask what your plans are for the day and offer assist for tube/bus times and schedules. it is like a small family. now when i go to london i know where i am staying and i do not have to think twice about it. it is so close to all the major attractions, good restaurants and train station!!! totally awesome and unforgetable!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we stayed at the london wall hotel on the weekend of the london marathon. we arrived in london early as spectators and dropped off our luggage and checked in at 11am. the helpful staff provided us with luggage storage until our room was ready. | the hotel itself is situated within the business district of london and was quiet and clean. there was a number of shops around the area and good restaurants/coffee places too. the underground at moorgate and bank was literally 3-5 minutes away on foot and very easy to find. it only took a few minutes on the tube from kings cross. | that evening when we arrived, we found that the staff had transported our bags to our room, closed the curtains and turned the bed down which was a lovely touch! the staff did this every night of our stay. in addition to complementary tea, coffee and water, we also had jelly beans and pringles - which was great when we returned from shows at night. | the room itself was a superior king size room and it was cleaned and decorated to the highest standard of any hotel i have ever stayed in. the bathroom had a bath and separate walk in shower. i do not normally sleep too well on holiday but the bed was great and the air conditioning provided a welcome breeze! | we decided to have room service breakfast one morning as a treat, it was ordered easily by way of a door hanger that you completed before bed. it was delivered hot and on time at the time we specified. although it was pricey, it was a lovely treat! we also ate in the hotel one evening and the meal and service was great - we charged it to the room and paid it at the end of the stay. | i would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a touch of luxury on their next stay in london! i am already planning my next trip back down!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we stayed here in november not long after it re-opened. | we had stayed twice before the refurbishment and we were not disappointed | i recommend afternoon tea, its expensive but a real treat. | cannot wait to stay again!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''could not fault the hotel or service in any way. the restaurant, bars, hotel, spa and all the staff within each of them were just incredible. the quality of the hotel was just wonderful. absolutely perfect'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this new hotel is in a great location, just off trafalgar square and 1 minute from embankment tube station. it'san immaculate hotel with sumptuous rooms with large bathrooms. we had an executive room. all the public areas were stunning. if i could find anything to criticise, it would be that the fridge in the room was not working and the drinks were warm which was not pleasant. apart from that, a 5 star rating and we will be returning as soon as we possibly can!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''visited with family for 2 nights. this place is pricey but defiantly worth the extra dime, you do feel like royalty the moment you check in. the decor is grand and service can not be faulted. | breakfast is great, massive selection. afternoon tea is delicious. there is live music in the bar area as well which makes the setting perfect.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''spent a saturday night in the savoy hotel london that was very enjoyable. this is a smart slick hotel that has booking in down to a fine art. no luggage is allowed through the front so this is where it is left and your vehicles are parked for you. luggage is in your room before you arrive init. having booked in you are taken to your room. the rooms are well appointed and luxurious, comfortable, and very clean. bathrooms are lovely with everything you need with plenty of large white towels. there are plenty of staff on duty at all times and they are all very polite and courteous giving superb service. check out is also slick and on request luggage and car appear at the front of the hotel for departure. this hotel looked great with beautiful xmas decorations and trees in reception and the restaurants. a very enjoyable stay.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''from the moment you walk into the hotel, you feel special. | the staff are all so warm and welcoming, they make you feel like you have just come home. | everything about this hotel oozes quality, from the deep plush carpets in the promenade, the stunning flowers displays, the professionalism of every single member of staff... faultless. | the room, just stunning, the most comfortable nights sleep you will ever have, the bathroom is so luxurious with complete marble and the deepest baths i have ever seen. | the housekeeping team are discreet, no clanking trollies! if they see you coming, they stop what they are doing, pull to one side, acknowledge you, wait for you to pass before resuming their duties. | you must try the spa, my wife said it was the best massage she has ever had! | afternoon tea is also something not to be missed- still in my opinion the best in london. | breakfast again is not just breakfast, but an event, the quality of ingredients and staff is second to none. | dispute not being uber rich, and saved hard for this treat, the staff never made you feel like you do not belong, quite the opposite, we were made to feel so special from the second we arrived to when we sadly had to leave. | oh one last point, the best espresso martinis in the world. | the dorchester is still without a doubt one of the great dames of london and the world. | to sum it up, the dorchester lives up to its moto... | ""perfection just happens"" all be it with the dedication and hard work of the amazing staff. | finally, emma at guest relations is in my opinion one of the biggest assets to the hotel, never have we been treated so well, like an old friend, emma goes above and beyond, i can never thank you enough for what you done for us, thank you so so much.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''a large group of us went for afternoon tea on a sunday at the dorchester. on arrival at the hotel i was very impressed with the surroundings and decor. we were warmly welcomed and shown to our tables, which looked beautiful- the china was the finest and daintiest i have seen! the choice of teas were quite bewildering but i finally decided on the dorchester blend and was not disappointed. we were firstly served sandwiches, as much as we could eat. i tried most varieties and they were all fantastic! next came a peach and vanilla desert- which was followed by warm scones- delicious! we had a selection of pastries which were quickly refilled as i had to try most of them- they were all very tasty! we offered more of everything, although after my second cake i was rather full. the ambience is lovely, a piano playing throughout and even the ladies restrooms were impressive! 10/10 i enjoyed myself immensely as well as the rest of my party- i would love to go again!!!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''we enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much we were there for my company christmas party that was held at the guild hall which is just around the corner when we got back from the party we enjoyed a quite drink in the comfortable hotel bar then to our room for nice quite nights sleep.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we loved this hotel. the location was perfect for walking to many locations and is literally minutes from the embankment station tube stop. great for exploring the west end and theater district. the specialty restaurant massimo was delightful. my only caveat is be prepared for a very expensive stay. 35 pounds for breakfast!! we walked down the street for the ambiance of a local coffee shop. gorgeous, huge room with walk in closet. the outdoor heated patio was super for after theater drinks.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this was not our first stay but as always the staff were extremely attentive and friendly. in particular, the front desk and the restaurant. the hotel has a terrific atmosphere and as always, our stay was most enjoyable.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i stayed at the corinthia some 5 months ago and wrote a review then. during that visit, not everything was as it ought to have been for a 5 star property - there was room for improvement. upon my recent return, i found that everything worked like clock work. it was truly flawless. | | service was exceptional at all levels in the restaurants, bar and reception. it was clearly obvious that all the staff had made a real effort to improve on the areas where i had commented upon in my earlier review and now there was a perfect understanding of a guests' needs and more importantly anticipating it before one had to ask. | | special mention must go to the staff in the breakfast room who made such an improvement from my last visit. they really behaved like true professionals in their field surpassing my expectations of service standards. their recollection of my preferences from my previous visit simply floored me. there was no necessity to remind them of what i wanted for breakfast during my weeks' stay, they politely checked if my preferences were the same each day. | | the staff have managed so well to pull off what the four seasons and the mandarin oriental hotels are so renowned for - guest recognition - this time without exception they all had it nailed down. | | as on my first visit, domenico and his staff at the bassoon bar were just simply fantastic, making me feel at ease and relaxed upon my return after hectic days at the office. the managers michelangelo, maud and renaud were ever so gracious and always checking to ensure that all was in order. special mention also to head concierge daren who obtained a ticket for war horse, which i thoroughly enjoyed. the concierge team was fantastic and did not bat an eyelid to my ever demanding and constant requests. - thank you. | | one other noticeable change, perhaps since i recognize them now; is that there was always a clear visibility of management at all times, whether one was in the restaurant or public spaces; unobtrusive though but keeping a watchful eye over service standards. | | bravo for the improvements and exceptional attention to detail and service.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''not much to add to the other positive reviews of this hotel. this year some building is done very near the hotel, so if your easily bothered by noise (during the day only) ask for a room on the opposite side. | enjoyed our stay...good staff, room and amenities, would return'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we had the pleasure of staying at the corinthia for the 4th time over christmas and we had a wonderful stay. | there have been some recent comments criticizing service and food. i could not disagree more on either front. | first of all, i have to highlight how helpful and accommodating the hotel was to us. due to delayed flights, missing bags and attacks in berlin, we changed our travel plans at the last minute and arrived in london days early - on christmas eve. the hotel found a way to include us in the christmas dinner which was fully committed. we greatly appreciated the effort. we were also able to get last minute spa appointments - again much appreciated. | our room (a deluxe junior suite) was fabulous. spacious with an entry area, sitting area with table, etc. and then a large bedroom with walk-in closet and large bathroom (with dual sinks, separate shower and tub). we even had a small balcony. note to the hotel: coat hooks in the entry would be really helpful! | the christmas dinner was delicious as were the breakfasts in northall. we also enjoyed the fish &amp; chips that we had in the bassoon bar. | if i had to cite a weak point, it would be massimo's restaurant. we ate there on a previous stay and were not wowed. we went for a drink on this stay and the service was less than spectacular. | we have stayed several places in london and we debate trying another - but we keep coming back to the corinthia. it is so hard to beat as far as location, ambience, pretty much everything. we have now been at the hotel for christmas (spectacular decorations). we were there last year for nye and had an amazing time. | highly recommended.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''i went with two girlfriends for bottomless brunch and we had a lovely afternoon! michal was amazing and we had brilliant service throughout! the food was amazing and excellent value for money. michal took a lovely photo of us on the southbank to commemorate our wonderful news! | a great way to celebrate becoming bridesmaids! :)''',2
The Savoy,"'''i stayed at the savoy for a recent conference and i really like the fairmont brand. the hotel is the grande dame of london in the best location. the facilities are absolutely impeccable despite the fact that the building is old if not ancient. everything is just perfect and believe me i stay north of 120days per year in hotels around the globe and what i experienced here surpassed pretty much everything i have seen before, let me elaborate. | when i arrived at the hotel i was in midst of a conference call. the receptionist realized right away that i was very absorbed in my call and ensured that all the formalities, etc were done swift and easily so that i could go to my room not to be disturbed. now the best part, one hour later i was commissioned the give a speech and guess what, the zipper of my pants broke - one of these uncomfortable situations - what to do? give the speech in a pair of jeans? well i called the reception and literally 5 minutes later someone picked up my pants and 40min later brought them back all fixed. i could not believe it - clearly saved my day. | when i checked out next morning i expected off course to pay for the service. to my surprise it was complementary... wow .. | all in all probably one of the best hotel experiences i had over the last years - bravo savoy , bravo fairmont'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''go during the day and gawp! this place has all the trappings of a top class hotel on display to the casual loitering ne'erdowell (which is how we classed ourselves). for the price of an expensive but nice cup of tea, we swanked it with the footballers, their wives and assorted glitterati in the hotels massive foyer. only a few yards from my own club this really is the most splendid show in london - a couple of hundred yards from trafalgar square - a must go for any tourist!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''i come here every year and ever time i am always pleased. the manager rob, mari, and other staff was outstanding. we had a few issues but rob superseded our expectations in accommodating and making sure we were comfortable. | because of his awesome ability to manage this hotel and great people skills i will be back again and again and again. | congrats to whoever hired him.... you did a great job!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''very nice hotel with a very good location on the park lane , many rooms have hyadpark view. | lobby is very busy , spicily for after noon tea. | the hotel has one of the best spa in london. | very close to most shopping'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,'''although i was only staying here for one night on a business trip i would not hesitate in going back. service and staff were excellent and the hotel is generally of a very high standard as you would expect. the room was particularly well appointed with an enormous bathroom. excellent location for visiting anywhere around westminster and the south bank.''',2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we chose the hotel based on location for out trip, &amp; it fitted perfectly with what we wanted. | a bit disappointing that not all the facilities were open over christmas, but there was enough to keep us happy. | the rumpus room is definitely worth a visit, although it is better to book a reservation, &amp; was one of the areas not open over christmas. | the dandelyan became our favourite haunt for the variety of cocktails &amp; food, but more so for the friendliness of the staff, who made us feel very much at home. again, booking a reservation is advisable at busy periods. | we were offered an upgrade to a superior room, &amp; compared to the standard room my daughter had, i really could not see what we paid the extra for. | the breakfast on christmas day was second to none, as was the free screening of ""love actually"" downstairs &amp; complimentary mince pies &amp; christmas card - a very nice touch. | a most enjoyable stay over christmas.'''",2

"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''we had stayed at a traditional hotel in our last trips to london and a change was welcome. our stay was short, three nights but we loved the rooms, spacious comfortable, bathroom with bath salt and amenities, the vibe and the service personal but at the same time professional and not intrusive. the lobby was lively but private at the same time, pool was beautiful and a big plus even if the water was a bit cold,jacuzzi was great, gym was well equiped and empty which suited us and staff helpful. only drawback was breakfast that lacked variety and prompt service ,but in general a very good experience. would go back in a heartbeat !'''",2

The Savoy,"'''so this was my first time staying at the savoy, and something i looked forward to for some time. in most respects, i was not disappointed. | first, the location is somewhat unique among it is peer group, more likely to be situated in mayfair. so the savoy's proximity to west end theatre and dining options is a plus, if that suits your interests, as it does mine. next, the public space is grand and serene, the staff is efficient and helpful, and the bars and restaurants are chic. | the rooms? luxurious, of course. not large, but sufficient in size. well appointed. however, a few quibbles. despite years of renovation within the past decade, the savoy decided not to meet the level of luxury in the bathrooms found at the connaught, as an example. the shower is barely more modern than the old hand-held wand approach. adequate, but out of date, and surprising to me in view of what the competition offers and how recently millions were spent on renovation. | ten bps a day for wireless internet service? at the prices charged by the savoy for a room, one would expect a bit more generosity. i guess they figure that at these prices, their guests do not care about another fifteen bucks a day. but free wireless would have been a nice gesture, in my view, and what i would expect from this property. | great, grand, historic, well-located hotel. good service. but this hotel plays in the big leagues, and, for the money, i think there are better choices.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''quite frankly this is a fantastic hotel, my wife &amp; i enjoyed our stay so much. our room was very spacious and modern, with a very comfortable bed, and an excellent bathroom. the staff are very friendly and helpful. the hotel is very well located on the south bank and it has excellent bars and restaurants with superb views over the river thames. i have stayed at many hotels in the last 30 years and this one is amongst the very best.'''",2

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''the lobby at the top of the stairs has a welcoming log fire but only two chairs if you are waiting to meet somebody or for a taxi. the doorman will open the door and hail a taxi for you. | not the sort of place you can wander into. although you could drink in the bar area at the back beside the dinner restaurant. | my lunch at heston blumenthal's dinner restaurant was a delight, open to all who are willing to pay for a special occasion. | the hidden reception rooms at the back associated with royalty were interesting for those who can afford private functions such as weddings. | the downstairs staff were abundant and willing. the long wait to see a bedroom was ridiculous. | the bedroom i saw was delightfully comfortable. everything five star. marble floor bathroom. bidet. the widest bed you can imagine. but the balcony was a disappointment, no chairs, and if you wanted to smoke or take a photo, uninviting. i was scared to step out to see the view and take a photo for fear of bringing back dirt and moss onto the opulent carpet. the decor of this room was colourless and old fashioned but other rooms are in different styles. the hotel will be much more attractive later in the year when they finish the swimming pool. my companion liked the dark entrance hall. i prefer light and white and was happier in the main dining room.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''very nice and modern hotel, rooms are spacious and comfortable. the staff at the reception were very pleasant and helpful. the location is just ""ok"" bars/restaurants within a 5-10 minute walking distance and 15 minutes or so walking distance from the london eye tourist attraction. the rooms have fantastic bathrooms with complimentary toiletries such as shower gel/shampoo/conditioner/body lotion etc. although, the complimentary pack you generally get in hotels that include shower cap, cotton wool and whatever else was available but for some reason had nothing in the box, possibly a housekeeping mistake? nevertheless, the breakfast is lovely with stunning views overlooking the river. even though i consider this a decent hotel, i would not personally see it as a five star, but hey, they must have the rating for a reason!'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''london hotels are a lottery especially mid range with poor staff and shabby dcor but not this one. we booked through last minute and stayed one night at the weekend, the hotel seems brand new and although the rooms are not huge they are pristine. the staff are welcoming and attentive. having left something behind at the hotel they have gone out of their way to return it to me. | we got a good deal so not sure what the normal rate is and a full breakfast is 25 extra with egg on toast at 15 but there is a small starbucks next door so we went there.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''do not ever walk past this hotel. the staff are fabulous. the hotel is a little over trendy but so chilled. dandelyan is the best cocktail bar in europe and watching the bartenders is like watching theatre. nothing is too much trouble. however, sadly the restaurant is not great. service is poor and menu a little too trendy for us. breakfast is not great value. bar plates better all round in bar. also all spa fully booked great location on river. easy to walk to covent garden etc. best towels i ever used!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea in the beautiful, elegant lobby lounge. the staff is very professional, friendly and everything was clearly explained and served with a smile. | the sandwiches, scones and fancies, all delicious and washed down with a glass of champagne and lashings of tea. you could request more of anything you wanted. | what sets this afternoon tea apart from others was the calm atmosphere, the tables set apart from others allowing space for each party to enjoy each other's company and not packed like sardines as happens in some other high end hotelsi have visited. no conveyor belt here! | my only small complaint, and i do mean small was that there was a wedding party having photographs taken and the bride was being photographed at the pillar at the side of my table. while to some this might have been a pleasant distraction, to me it was a distraction i could have done without. i am sure in such a beautiful establishment there would have been many a pillar to stand at for a more intimate picture.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''this hotel is right in the heart of kensington, a short walk to the underground, harrod's and hyde park &amp; kensington gardens. their customer service was superb. the room was large by london standards, enough room to have a table and chairs to sit. breakfast buffet was included, and they were very helpful with tips on restaurants and transportation to concerts. we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be close to everything central london.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the setting is great, and the hotel is stylish and chic; the staff could not have been more helpful and welcoming. the view from the top floor cocktail bar must be one of the best in london - a really great stay!'''",2

The Rembrandt,'''stayed here for three nights with my wife and youngest child as we enjoyed the sights of london. this hotel is well situated for getting out and about. the staff are friendly and helpful too. my son enjoyed the pool and we would definitely stay at this hotel again. the bar menu had cheesey chips on it.....presumably to stop uscheek northern monkeys from getting too home sick.''',2

The Rembrandt,"'''my wife and i recently completed our second stay at the rembrandt in london; 9-6-04 to 9-10-04. the rooms are above average, with the usual amenities, room safe, hairdryer, but also a trouser press, a small tea and coffee locker, as well as a whirlpool tub. | service and concierge are top notch, they quickly booked us a tower of london tour at a reasonable price. the location is outstanding, walking close to harrods, the v&amp;a museum, natural history musum, and buckingham palace. kensington square and tube stops are literally outside the door. | best of all the full breakfast in the dining room, with eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, etc, included with the room was super. we got a great promotional rate from their website. this place is a winner.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''stopped here for my wifes birthday on 9th october - hotel is in a great location and is very stylish. we used the ground floor bar and the restaurant for breakfast - both were top notch. the best thing here is the friendly staff - my wife and i were given free cocktails for her birthday and even a little glass of champagne. | recommend a window seat in the restaurant to look out on the great views''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''this is a great place to stay if you wish to visit the great museums of london such as the v&amp;a, the natural history and the science museums. the royal albert hall is just up the road if you wish to attend concerts and there are good transport links via the nearby sth kensington tube station. the hotel is large and comfortable and the adjoining leisure centre is a great place to unwind after a hard days sightseeing. breakfast is a bit hectic.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this was our third stay at the ridgemont. our stay this time was 8 days, and we loved every minute of it. this hotel is especially nice since it location is close to everything you want to do in london. the theaters, shopping, restaurants are all walking distance. the hotel remain very clean and well maintained. also, the a full breakfast is included in the price. the rooms are typical london. since we spend most of our time touring during the day, we see no sense on spending two to three times as much at another hotel in the area, unless you never leave the hotel. the san pancreas train station is a 10 minute walk with luggage, and the goodge underground is 3 blocks away so travel in london is easy. if you are older and do not like to walk up steps, request a room on a lower floor. they have quite an assortment of rooms, some small, some that can easily accommodate a family of four, so be sure to ask for what you want. the owners are especially nice and do a great job of giving directions and information. they are a bit older and i fear the day they decide to retire, not so much because of who the next owners will be, more because the current owners are the heart and soul of the hotel..'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''i have been staying here on most of my london trips since shortly after the hotel opened and it remains my favourite hotel in london. the rooms are spacious and warmly and luxuriously decorated and furnished. fantastically comfortable beds! the bathrooms are especially large with excellent showers. the staff combine highly professional standards with quiet, courteous, friendly service. the location makes this a quiet and relaxing, but highly interesting part of london in which to stay, especially at the weekends when the city workers are away, yet it is extremely close by tube and bus to the west end and by foot to shoreditch'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''cannot say enough about our experience with the corinthia. for starters, the location cannot be beat -- you are less than five minutes walking from the eye, trafalgar square, big ben, and so much more. next, the staff is extraordinary -- in particular the concierge sahil performed miracles and was spot on with every recommendation. the rooms are classy, though those on the inside suffer from lousy views. there is also celebrity chic -- besides the bond connection, it seems like every movie shot in london holds its press conferences here, so you never know who you might see in the lobby or at breakfast,,,,'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i was brought here for my birthday back in december, and we were welcomed so warmly by the doormen, and the concierge team inside. | upon checking in, we managed to get a free upgrade, to what can only be described as the most incredible room!! | the interior of the hotel was breath taking, very modern, smelt wonderful, amazing atmosphere, i really felt like i was important. | our room was so spacious, split into a dining/living area and a bedroom/bathroom. | we had two balconies which over-looked the thames and just the most stunning view over london. views of st. pauls and the shard. | no noise from any other rooms. | we got a bottle of prosecco, and my other half had asked them to lay real rose petals from the door to the bed and create a heart on the bed too. | everything was just so perfect. the tv worked fantastic, we had a gorgeous free-standing bath and a really big walk-in shower too. | i would live here, if i could! i really miss staying here, and i would most definitely return. | ideal for couples! | thank you for the most perfect stay.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we spend three nights at the apex london wall during early august. this hotel was full of many pleasant surprises from the beginning. we landed in london very early, around 6:30 am and got to the hotel around 9am. on our arrival we found out that we could do an early and free check in, plus we were given an upgrade to a delux room! this certainly made our day much nicer and pleasant as we did not have to wander the streets of london until the afternoon, waiting for our room to be ready. the room itself was always spotless. besides a little defect in the shower door, which did not completely close, it was very well kept and was very, very spacious. we did not have any special view from our window but at least we faced the street, which is very quiet on the weekend. although, we are not necessarily affected by noise from the outside, we did find that the street being so quiet may be something that a lot of people staying here will appreciate. we opted to have breakfast in the hotel every morning and we were pleased by the food's nice quality and ample selection. although, our reservation stated we would have a daily english breakfast, we were given the option to have whatever other things we wished from the menu --another nice touch! in regards to the staff, everyone was incredibly polite and helpful and made us feel very welcomed. i will say though, that i was not particularly excited about this hotel's location. although, you are a short tube ride away from all the major attractions, the area around the hotel is pretty much deserted and lacking of interesting places to visit (other than st paul's cathedral, maybe). i suppose this is not a major flaw but if you want to be in the middle of all of london's excitement, i would suggest to look elsewhere. also, keep in mind that getting to/from london gatwick may be a long way and you will need plenty of time and/or money to get there. it is not so bad from heathrow, especially if you use the heathrow express to paddington and then a taxi to the hotel (like we did). as feedback for the hotel i think that the wifi needs major improvements as it had very poor reception in the room and only a so, so reception and speed in the restaurant. i would say that if you are looking for a decent hotel in london that does not empty your entire bank account to pay for one night, and if you do not care much about hotel amenities and excitement, then this is your hotel. you cannot be wrong with it, especially when taking london standards into account.'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''i was taken to mondrian london hotel this friday 8th april 2016 for my 29th birthday which was a surprise gift from my partner. i was very happy when i found out that we was staying at the mondrian as i have visited before for drinks and dinner at the sea containers and really enjoyed it. when we checked in and checked out we received very good customer service. we checked in around 3.30pm our room was on the 15th floor room number 1525 (i think) we had an amazing view of the oxo tower and the room was 1st class i was over the moon and very happy to be staying here we went out for dinner that night to sexy fish resultant in mayfair and rang the reception to order us a taxi which they done with no bother we returned around 8.30pm that evening and went up to the rumpas rooms which is their cocktail bar on the top floor where we used our gift voucher handed to us when we checked in with a very lovely personnel message to us wishing us a happy stay we found this very welcoming and a nice gesture for my birthday evening and thought we would be silly to not use it. when we got up to the bar we was greeted by two men standing at the entrance who were very lovely then we ordered two cocktails and was very shocked at how bad the customer service was by the bar staff when i passed him the voucher he did not seam to happy i then asked him if he could bring the cocktails over to us- we was sitting on a small sofa directly in front of the bar he responded no ill wave over when they are done he was middle aged dark curly hair in he is early 30s when he waved and i got up to collected the cocktails he asked if i had a tab open i responded and said no i have just given you our voucher he responded with no you have not and he is work friend said yes she has she gave it to you and you put it through the till i then carried my cocktails over to were we was sitting you do not except that kind of service in that kind of environment i get a better service in the local bar where i live in essex- i was quite shocked and shortly after that we was approached by a lady called brie i am sure she had an irish accent she asked us how our night was and what we had been up to that day and was very pleasant and found us a seat by the window with a lovely view of london and some commentary bites to make up for how rude the bar staff were so id like to thank her for this as we could not seam to find her when we left an hour later but she defiantly made up for this and looked after us. in the morning we woke up and went down to the spa for 8am it was so nice down there very quiet and relaxing just what we needed after that we went to the sea containers for breakfast around 10am and the breakfast was really nice quite pricey 27 for two egg avocado rolls and two coffees but very tasty and a nice environment so i would defiantly recommend the mondrian to my family and friends as the hotel is lovely and a great location. i really recommend for anyone that is visiting to take you spa stuff to make full use of the hotel.''',2

The Savoy,"'''we visited on a friday evening we had booked a table as there was a large group of us. (i think if you had not it was rather busy so you may not get seats) there seemed to be a mixture of people, we were all dressed up but some groups were dressed casually. the american bar is very elegant, the bar has beautiful settings. the staff are very knowledgable if you are unsure of what to drink they will recommend a drink or even make something off menu for you. the resulting drinks were fantastic, if a little slow to arrive once ordered. a fabulous evening was had by all. we did not eat but the food being served looked wonderful. great ambience, jazz piano player. we had a booth which was great as you could hear what each other was saying above the general hubbub of other drinkers.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my husband and i stayed here last night to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and from start to finish it has been the best hotel experience we have ever had! | i can not say enough about the friendliness, attentiveness and helpfulness of the staff here - it is a newly opened hotel and despite the opulence and beauty of the public areas the staff here manage to make it feel almost as if you are staying in a small family-run business, such is their enthusiasm for the hotel and genuine delight at seeing it finally receiving guests. | the lobby is stunning, the rooms a great size with every amenity, cocktails in the bar overlooking the thames were out of this world and the atmosphere in there is ridiculously cool! (as was our lovely cocktail waitress) | special mention must also go to the breakfast - we were lucky enough to be on a rate which included continental breakfast - which we would usually upgrade - but this was no ordinary continental, everything was perfect, delicious fruit, the softest, tastiest pastries and muffins, smoked salmon, charcuterie meats - you get the picture - and it was all complemented beautifully by the view of st pauls just beyond the river. my husband and i agreed that if we were back in london we would without question re-book this hotel, and if we are not staying we will be arriving early to come back for breakfast! | if you are considering this hotel, book it - especially now while it is so very new and exciting!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we have stayed in many luxury hotels in london but this is by far the best! every little detail just works. | the lobby area is stunning with a huge domed roof housing an amazing light installation. vases of beautiful pink flowers add a splash of colour to the shiny marble surfaces. everything oozes class. however this is not one of those hotels where the impressive decor fails to last beyond the lifts. the corridors themselves are luxurious- i never thought i would find myself excited by a corridor but they just feel sumptuous. the class continues in the bedrooms- our room had three huge windows and a glimpse of the river, a large bathroom with a rain shower, endless supplies of fluffy towels, a tv over a huge bath, the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in, a nespresso machine, a media hub which allows you to connect pcs and ipods to the tv, quality espa toiletries, atmospheric lighting, all within tasteful, comfortable decor. when we returned to the room in the evening, rather than finding the standard cheap chocolate on the pillow we found a little box of retro sweets instead. the maid had even put water and glasses by the bed, as if they knew we would be waking up a little hungover.the most impressive thing however was the silence. i did not hear a single noise from another room for the duration of our stay. | the service was also fantastic, there is none of the snootiness you get in some 5* hotels, everyone was friendly and we were made to feel relaxed. the atmosphere in the hotel is unlike anything i have come across- they do not try too hard to be trendy, it does not feel stuffy-it is just perfect. this hotel, unlike so many others, is able to deliver an experience which justifies its high room rates.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''you are greeted by a soft hum as you enter the beautiful hotel on park lane, a world away from the busy london streets. located a short distance from the famous hyde park, at the heart of mayfair, the dorchester really has a prime position in the west end of london. we were lucky enough to stay over night, our room being luxurious yet remaining elegant and simple. one thing i will never forget was the comfort of the bed, which we practically had to climb to get into! the staff are above professional going out of their way to ensure you have an amazing stay. breakfast was held in the main foyer which is also home to several top bars to be frequented in the evening. this is a hotel of real class, definitely a recommendation if only for a drink at the red bar. (if you are able to go in december, you will be blown away by the christmas decorations!)'''",2

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''from the glass of prosecco on arrival to the delicious breakfast, our experience here was perfect. our room was airy and light (huge windows!), bed was so comfy and bathroom was huge, with separate shower and bath. all the amenities you would expect from a 4 star hotel, plus extra free goodies in the room. the staff we are very friendly and helpful, and really made us feel welcome. little touches like free movie rentals and the cute duck you get to take home really made our stay just that little bit extra special. will definitely stay again.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''new york based; stayed at this hotel 3 nights for work. the hotel arrival experience was prompt and perfect after a long flight. i stayed in room 303 which is nice and isolated for someone who wants a good sleep. barely any noises from other patrons or the streets. i happened to arrive on easter monday and the surrounding area was totally dead (made it easy to walk into nearby restaurants without a reservation).''',2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we were checked into a truly terrible liar of a premier hotel called london premier kensington ( review to follow once i have recovered) we are in london on business and working very long days, the relief to be back here instead of there i could not explains in words, but it felt much much much better. | we were upgraded because they were full, and the room was as lovely as before. nespresso machine beautifully decorated but most importantly the gloriously comfortable bed and the fabulous duvet. i had a great nights sleep and refreshed after the great shower. i started my hectic day at 6.30am. | i got back this eve at 7pm snoozed on the bed and woke to the tap on the door where the chambermaid offered to turn down the bed ( i refused as i can sort that ! ) but i did eat the two gorgeous tiny macaroons with an apple filling she offered me ( oops one was for my husband ) | i stay in hotels for business a lot and we do regularly resort in london to premier inns as they are consistent. but this is the hotel for me from now on, they are providing superb customer service and the quality of the room is up there with the big hotels, it is not a big room even in the next upgrade but i cannot fault it. i think you know by now i am impressed! | watch out for my not impressed review soon.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''fantastic stay !!! check in w/ katarina was great, very welcoming and genuine. housekeeping team fantastic !! in-room dining quick and to order. great amenities in the room. thank you savoy team - please visit the grand del march'''",2
The Savoy,"'''exception service is first thing that comes to mind! a level above most other 5 star hotels even in london. a manager emailed me the day before my check in date asking for my arrival information and any special requests and all have been accomodated. you get a personal message from the manafer, not an automated form to fill out. as other reviewers noted the minute you walk into the looby you are greated by a greater/host and are taken straight to your room, no usual reception check-in experience. i appreciated that personal element. what still puzzles me the most is how they knew my name ( i have not been asked by the hostess, instead she greated me by the name and took me straight to my room). the porter must have glansed at my luggage tag during that thos few second that he was helping me with luggage at the cab. whichever way, it was impressive. within 15 minutes from arriving at the hotel i had tea sent to my room, massage and dinner in a sought after soho restaurant booked. the decor and style might be fussy (but that is a matter of taste), bubt is otherwise a very beautiful property. one of those where you do not even feel it is approproate to discuss cleaness of facilities, etc. it is just perfect. ro0ms are not huge (my executive room was standard in size) but beaituful. it is big and layout is a bit confusing, but i assume they had to work with a historic property when renovating it recently. room service was fast (when you order they give you exact time when the food will arrive) and for hotel room service food exceptional (middle eastern mezze were on par with best ny restaurants). wi-fi is not free unless you a member of fairmont presidents club. i mentioned to my hostess that i do not know my membership number, so she must have looked it up herslf and as no internet charges appeared on the bill.'''",2
The Savoy,'''i stayed at the savoy with my husband for 2 nights in january. the service was first rate and the surroundings all that you would expect. however on the first night i found the bed so soft and lacking in support for my back that i spent 5 hours of the night trying to sleep on the floor. in fairness to the hotel and following complaint they did turn the mattress to what appeared to be a harder side and place a board under it for the second night. that was a good deal better. i did not have a bad back before i went to the savoy. i did for a few days afterwards.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''the corinthia is immaculately presented and located so centrally that you will not need to buy a travelcard for many london attractions - not that i expect many of its guests use public transport. it is an expensive, luxury hotel but london, like most capital cities, is not embossed with a large value for money stamp so for it is a great choice. the staff are impeccably trained with an eye for detail and an unostentatious but professional 'nothing-could-be-too-much-trouble' attitude. | our rooms were spacious, wardrobes were in the hall so the whole room is useable space. it is a sign of a good hotel in my opinion if you can hardly hear the door being knocked and there was certainly no sound from anywhere once the thick oak door was closed. bathroom perfect and bath almost so big that you struggle to stay in one place (and i am not short). the floors and mirrors are heated, naturally, and the air-con is in permanent whisper mode it seems. we were in the most basic of rooms and are fairly fussy travellers but there was nothing to complain about at all. | the breakfast was superb and (rarely do we do this but...) the hotel restaurant in the evening was delightful too, with an atmosphere that most in-house eateries lack. in particular the man in the suit at breakfast runs the most impressive service i have seen in a hotel - for example, the temperature of the berries are frequently checked and although there is a buffet, staff always ask if you would like a refill of juice/fruit/bread. everything was cooked to perfection and presented beautifully. | the pool is hardly suitable for an intensive exercise regime but who needs that after walking around london all day? i did not try out the gym but i am sure it would be impressive. to help put the hotel espa area into context, the changing rooms for the thermal pool/swimming pool have daybeds, the steam room has pods with individual cool showers and there are sleep pods should one feel the bed in their room to uncomfortable (as if). children are allowed in the spa area and swimming pool but at restricted time - timings not ideal for us but we worked around it. these were 1100-1230 and 1500-1630 which means cutting into too much daytime for us but i am sure it would suit people with younger children - ours are 4 and 8 with pretty good stamina. | i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone - business, pleasure, families or anyone for that matter would feel welcome here. we will undoubtedly be back - i do not always recommend small hotels but this establishment has enough rooms i am sure we would always be able to squeeze in somewhere. even if you decide to stay elsewhere - i would call in for afternoon tea. we missed out here but it looked impressive. five stars indeed.'''",2
The Savoy,'''i had always wanted to have dinner at the savoy and my 70th birthday was an ideal time and a surprise gift from my family. | it was a magical atmosphere and suberb meal. service could not have been better. | it really is worth pushing the boat out for a special occasion as it was a memorable evening''',2
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London",'''the wellesley is a (relatively) new knightsbridge hotel. it has been converted to a hotel from an office building and i have to say that the architects did a good job. the decor has a very luxurious feeling and the overall quality is very high. the ceilings in the rooms are a bit low but that did not bother me much. the location is definitely great.''',2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''i stayed at the hotel recently for one night in february. before booking i would visited the hotel and was kindly shown the superior and deluxe rooms. both were absolutely fantastic, clean and very stylish. i have seen other more expensive hotels which just do not compare to the standard of rooms that the apex london wall has to offer. in the end despite booking a superior room, to my delight i was upgraded to a deluxe room for free. the room was spacious and nicely laid out with a simply stunning bathroom and two large flatscreen tvs. throughout my stay, the staff were friendly and always had a smile on their faces. my girlfriend and i had an amazing weekend and the hotel definitely earned me a lot of brownie points! we would definitely go back there in the future. and my only regret is that we did not stay there longer!! so if you are after a luxurious hotel for good value then look no further than this hotel.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''i would like to share this story as an example of the wonderful service at the dorchester. | at about 2am on our first night my wife and i were awakened by sounds above our room. it was as though someone was dragging something across the floor and dropping it periodically. this lasted possibly ten minutes and stopped. on the second night, we were again awakened by the same sound at a similar time. i called the office slightly after 2am to report the noise... perhaps they could ask the people in the room above to be a bit quieter. after a brief pause, the manager came to the phone. ""there is no one in the room above you."" he asked if we could meet him in the hall outside our room in a few minutes. within 5 minutes he was there with two people who moved us to a new room at 2:30 in the morning. the room was a very high priced suite and absolutely gorgeous. there were no additional charges for the upgrade for the remainder of our 6 day stay. | we had asked for none of this and will never forget how well we were treated at one of the greatest hotels in the world.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''this is my favorite hotel in london for many reasons; location, service, accommodations, fitness club, spa, and the pool. i could write an entire review about the fitness club and pool. definitely worth a visit during your stay to get a quick print out from the inbody machine, painless and free. the readings can be stored and you can track results during future visits. | the staff is gracious and helpful and everything you can want or need is taken care of. the hotel is undergoing renovations and afternoon tea will temporarily be served in the restaurant overlooking hyde park that has a beautiful view.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''if you are lucky enough to be able to afford it, the corinthia is close to faultless. i always try to stay here when in london - sometimes going out of my way to experience their understanding of service. why cannot all hotels be like this..'''",2
The Savoy,"'''just walk in and enjoy the beautiful surroundings, knowledgeable and helpful staff, the american bar, the savoy grille, and close access to the strand and covent garden. the savoy has history and a beautiful redecoration, a wonderful environment to enjoy life.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''i booked this hotel at the last minute after another hotel screwed up my reservation. they were incredible. i was able to use the gym while they got my room situated, they schedule spa treatments to help me relax and gave me a special journal because i was on my way to a world trip. beyond safe, kind and courtesy. as an purveyor of luxury travel they exceed all expectations'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''we stayed 3 nights at the dorchester. while the rooms are quite nice and well-supplied, we had a view of an alley and it was extremely expensive. the food was not that good either.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i booked the rhodes hotel for my daughter and her boyfriend for their first trip alone to london and they have told me they were made to feel very welcome, the room was lovely and the owner was very kind and friendly to them. thank you for making my daughter's first solo trip to london so enjoyable.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''a great location, reasonable rates and a comfortable place to stay in central london. while not a ""deluxe"" hotel, it is certainly a very good bet of its type. great breakfasts (cooked to order), fast free wifi (although it may be slower in some rooms so check if that is important to you). very knowledgeable host who is happy to provide essential visitor advice. definitely a hotel we will use again.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''everything about the savoy gives you the best london has to offer. the food is beyond great, the service is beyond attentive and their attention to details astounds. the rooms are fantastic too, and are incredibly spacious for london standards. the beds are very comfortable and the spacious, opulent bathrooms are a nice touch. above all, the savoy has an ability to be very luxurious and classy to the hilt without succumbing to the stuffiness and formality of the ritz or claridges. | for london newcomers, strand is not the best location however. staying in mayfair is generally more pleasant, but things are so close by and the savoy is so good that its quite worth the compromise. | however, be prepared to pay 12 pounds for a bowl of sliced grapefruit and very possibly over 1000 pounds a night for a good room. it is a great hotel but you can stay at equally great hotels elsewhere for half the price.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we stayed few times. seamless customer service everywhere (reception, concierge, restaurants, spa, in rood dining...). good food, amazing spa, rooms are better (size, comfort, facilities...) than majority of london's 5 star hotels, convenient location. once you stay at corinthia you will not be looking for other places to stay in london.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''special thanks to carmen and mike, they are waitress from the apex london wall hotel. they were very kind with us. the hotel is very good. the people from reception should speak spanish too, or more languages than english only.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we stayed at the mandarin oriental, hyde park, london from 17 to 19 august and had a wonderful time. we had a room overlooking knightsbridge, but the double-glazing was very efficient so we slept soundly. everything in the hotel and the room was plush and comfortable. the staff could not have been friendlier and the breakfast in the garden overlooking hyde park was as memorable as the excellent food and service in the hotel's restaurant: ""dinner at heston blumenthal's"". this experience has encouraged us to look at other mandarin oriental hotels across the globe. we are difficult to please guests, but the staff at the mandarin oriental succeeded.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''decided to come to london for a weekend break with my wife. we stayed here the first month it opened and there was a few teething problems, i am glad to say it is a pretty slick operation now. feels like a typical city hotel but it oozes a bit of the cool! rooms are pretty big, the facilities are good and the rumpus room is a bit pricey but the views are great. a bit sneaky putting a 10% service charge on the bills regardless of wether there was good service or not. i suppose being an american chain this is normal. my wife has been back since and i will return again!!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''lovely hotel and staff. | the breakfast was very good, we had the continental with a good selection of different breads youghurt and fruits. | rooms nice and clean | good location i london with easy access to both bank and liverpool street station.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''we have just stayed a weekend in this hotel and had a great time. the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the room that we had was lovely. we got this through a special deal and will probably have to wait for a similar one to stay again as it is a touch pricey but it was a very good experience.''',2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''there are no words to express how wonderful our experience was at xenia. stunningly beautiful hotel, comfortable room, great location and, most importantly exceptionally welcoming, helpful &amp; friendly staff... and i mean everyone i met who works there. they could not possibly do enough for us &amp; after staying at a host of other hotels around the uk &amp; in london for the four weeks after our stay at xenia i can honestly say best accomodation ever!!! i would highly recommend xenia to all my family &amp; friends.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''after visiting the dorchester, &amp; claridges, i really did wonder if the savoy could equal them for brilliance, but guess what it does! i*t was my belated birthday and i was treated famously from moment i arrived till i left, afternoon tea there is fantastic, we could not eat all on offer so staff said they would send remainder up to the room to eat when we returned from strolling the sites! | they had only set up a table in our room! fabulouso! yes of course its expensive but treat yourself a one night stay with breakfast &amp; afternoon tea..its the stuff of dreams!'''",2
The Savoy,'''fortunately we were guests for an event to be held at the hotel. nonetheless it is an experience from the moment you walk through the doors and enter the lobby. indeed before you enter as the concierges on hand match propriety with enthusiasm and engagement. there is so much that can be said about the public rooms all of which have terrific quality. over the years we have stayed in different rooms all of which are finished to a fantastic degree and the relatively recent refurbishment has been exceptional in maintaining the style and ambiance while upgrading the product. of course the art deco feel is brilliant and we have stayed in a room that looks back at the thames and the recognisable sights from a great height. it is i guess a 'spoil yourself experience and in a fantastic location for the visitor to london.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,'''that is how i felt upon entering this fine hotel... | i had heard about this hotel from someone who works in the film entertainment industry and has stayed at the best of the best hotels. he said it was a great hotel so i decided to check it out. | i loved this hotel. from the moment you arrive they greet you with top quality service. the hotel is very close to everything but on a side of the street that was quite in terms of street noise. my room was not ready when i checked in at 12 so they had me wait and served some tea and snacks. it was quickly made up and i was sent up with my bags waiting in the room and fresh fruit. the lobby is a beautiful place to sit and relax. the rooms are very well appointed and are designed with good taste. all the amenities and bathroom was first class. ill be honest and say that i did not want to leave but when it was time to go the service was impeccable. i had to get to the tube so i was personally escorted across to the station and shown how to operate the ticket machine. it was a quick visit but i really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. i wish i had another day to visit the gym and spa which looked amazing. i hope to stay there again soon!''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''loved staying at the rembrandt. excellent rooms, service, and breakfasts. my favorite part was that free cell phone provided in the room called a handy. you could make free local calls, as well as call a persons handy in another room. but best of all, it had internet and google maps so i could walk or bike anywhere without ever having to turn on my phone and pay international charges. this was awesome! the rembrandt was an amazing experience from start to finish.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''hotel is very well situated for museums, harrods, south kensington tube and brompton quarter. good selection of bars and restaurants nearby. | staff in the bar, restaurant and cleaners do a great job. very accommodating. | a lovely atmosphere in bar area. | will return soon.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we stayed 4 nights in a jr suite which was absolutely fabulous. the room was large with a separate lounge room and a beautiful bathroom. upon arrival you are greeted and taken up to your room, no long check in process. the butler service is fantastic and they truly do take care of of you. we regret not having high tea in the hotel, it looked amazing and rumoured by many to be the best in london. only comment would be that we did not have anywhere to put our luggage, no folding luggage stands which we thought was really strange.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we stayed at the savoy hotel for one night on their special savoy on sunday deal. we have used the hotel previously for drinks and lunches and were curious about staying there. it met all our expectations - we found the staff charming, we upgraded our room and had a view of the river (partial building site view, but no noise). the room was very comfortable and quiet. we very much enjoyed the spa area and had the use of the swimming pool all to ourselves on a sunday afternoon. we love the american bar and the service is fantastic. we dined in kaspars and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. all in all, a good choice for us on a short stay in london and the hotel is in a great location.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''we visited for christmas supper. what a wonderful experience. the food, service and ambience were simply superb. in particular, the decorations were beautiful. this is not a cheap venue but is well worth splashing out for on a special occasion. so glad we did.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''the hotel product is phenomenal with new thinking on so many levels. the quality of the hotel product (furniture, decorations, art, wood details, beds, linen, shampoo/ soap...) is absolutely first class. it is tranquil, elegant and sophisticated without being stuffy and dull. our 8 year old daughter was amazed to find a bathrobe and slippers her size. the breakfast is one of the best i have ever had - variety on offer and the quality of the poached eggs cooked to order. i have a long list of positives, and here they are: fresh flowers everywhere, you walk through the flower room to get to the breakfast room, lobby also has an outdoor patio with a fire place, an amazing spa, the complimentary and top quality olives served with drinks, the variety of fruit offered over breakfast, the quietness of the hotel room. if you can, upgrade yourself to the next room type! you are up for a treat.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''we spent 4 nights at the mondrian and thoroughly enjoyed it. it is a very modern hotel in a great location. we spent a little extra for a room with a patio and given the good weather it was well worth the extra space. our room was large and clean and serviced to a high standard every day. the overall level of service was casual but attentive and helpful. we only used the restaurant for breakfast which was very good. we used the bar a lot and the service here was really good. unfortunately the roof terrace bar is not open on sunday and monday and the one evening we went up there they had shut the outside balcony due to noise restrictions which was a great shame.''',2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''stayed two nights last week in a classic room. yes, it was small, as was the bathroom, but perfectly ok if you do not think you are going to spend long in the room. | it was very well equipped, and we even had a tiny balcony overlooking lexham gardens, which was a bonus. there was a large walk-in rain shower and lovely toiletries. the bed and pillows were very comfy, and we did not experience any noise at all, either from outside or from other rooms. | we had lunch in the restaurant one day and thoroughly enjoyed it. breakfasts were also good, with hot food cooked to order. great breads and a good selection of fruit and yogurt. | all staff were polite, friendly and helpful, and we were made to feel very welcome . we normally stay nearer to central london but chose the xenia as we were bringing the car, and they have a very good arrangement with sainsbury's next door, where you can park for 15 a day, with all money going to charity. we will definitely consider staying here again.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we spent 6 nights in this hotel and we were very pleased with the service and overall standard. the staff are excellent and at all times strive to meet requests in a helpful, friendly and professional manner. | the rooms are small but immaculately clean, with crisp white linen and very comfortable beds. the ensuite, likewise, is small but contains everything you need and above all, immaculately clean. | the location too is extremely good, within a few minutes of gloucester rd. station. taxis are also very frequent along cromwell rd. | the wifi signal at times weak but it was not a big issue for us. | the continental breakfast is very good, with a wide variety of freshly prepared fruits, cereals, meats, cheeses, breads and pastries. plenty to choose from. reasonably priced at 12 pounds. | the only disappointment for us was the evening meal which was very poor. however, when i voiced my disappointment, it was immediately taken away and replaced with another dish of choice, which was an improvement. probably a little expensive for what you get. | that said, i would have no problem recommending this hotel, and would definitely stay there again. thank you, hotel xenia staff.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed last night for my boyfriends 30th birthday and everything about this hotel was brilliant! i had booked a river view room and when we checked in we found out they had upgraded us to a balcony river view suite which was amazing. everything about the room was perfect - decor and attention to detail could not have been better and the view over the river was beautiful, especially at night. all the staff were really friendly, polite and helpful - cannot remember names but both people on the reception who checked us in/out were fab as was the guy who showed us our room. and as we were getting ready to go out, we had a knock on the door and were greeted with a complimentary bottle of champagne, chocolate cake and happy birthday message. we did not get a chance to go in the cocktail bars but i imagine they are amazing - we ordered room service for breakfast this morning which was really good. hotel is beautiful and i wish we had been staying longer! looking forward to staying there again!'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we started our european vacation last june by staying in mandarin oriental london. we booked a knightsbridge room, and turns out it is a beautiful room. we got spoiled by attentive staff, especially the concierge guys. who helped us booked our tours, helping me sending my package to post office, etc. adding to that, the hotel's location is great! it is near the harrod's, harvey nichols, sloane street &amp; knightsbridge tube entrance, so it is easy to go everywhere. i think we made a mistake by starting our vacation from mo london, because after those pampering we get, other hotels we stayed simply can not compete mo london' standard, even though we also stay at 5 stars hotels.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my partner booked us a spur of the moment night away in a hotel in london. | he saw some great reviews on the mondrian and booked us in for that evening. loads of roadworks around the hotel which proved rather stressful to get to, but not something that anyone can change. on arrival the porter directed us to a nearby car park. | our room was lovely, the hotel is quite something else, very modern and has the wow factor. iv always wondered how do you improve on perfection? but this is pretty spectacular. | we were on the top (15th) floor with an amazing panoramic views of the amazing city. photos never do it justice. | bed: very comfortable and spacious. good pillows. | bathroom: lovely power shower and lovely complimentary toiletries. i would have loved a bath aswell as i only have a shower at home, so love a bath as a treat haha. | stunning drinks cabinet/fridge loaded with every goody possible, which i managed to resist. (do not know how) | lovely crystal glasses. | nice big tv that swivelled. | would i stay here again. definitely, but i would probably take the train next time, parking and driving is a bit of a mission understandably. | staff lovely, friendly and accomodating. 10/10'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed at the rembrandt hotel for our entire visit to london (11/12/13 - 16/12/13) and the experience, facility, location and service from the staff was outstanding. we were very pleased and surprised with the comfort and utility of our bedroom (room in the states). the hotel was decked out for the christmas holiday and had a very festive feel and charm. the location of the hotel to visit all the attractions and theatre in london is excellent, not to mention the shopping options on foot, like harrods and all the other retailers. the morning meal is a treat as well, great food options in an elegant setting with great staff that really pamper you and meet all your requests. we travel often in europe and have stayed in many hotels in many countries and the rembrandt, london is one of the best. if you plan a trip to london for the first time or as a returning traveler i strongly suggest that you stay at the rembrandt.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''in my line of work i get to stay in some very good hotels, stayed at the savoy in january for one week, everything was simply perfect from the service to the food. | i was a little nervous on arrival after reading a previous review stating that the guest was treated 'not as well' as the more affluent guests. now, i have a strong northern accent which i thought may have an affect on how i was received at the hotel. i was proved very wrong actually met a couple of members of staff from the same area as myself, but every member of staff i encounters were very warm and nothing was too much trouble . from the moment we arrived until the moment we left we were made to feel very welcome and given the vip treatment just like any other guest would expect at such a prestigious hotel. a wonderful experience. | conclusion. | wonderful hotel, staff, food, room, drinks and the rest. i would stay there again? at the drop of a hat!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''my sister, myself and my 2 small young sons stayed at the savoy for one night in july. | we booked a deal room rate and were quite obviously delighted when we arrived at reception to be told we had been upgraded to a suite overlooking the thames! i think they took pity in the fact all four of us would have been in the one room! | anyway, car was handed to the valet (so handy to have that 24 parking service) and we had lovely service up to the room. | the suite was sumptuous! gorgeous carpeting, moulded ceilings, rounded windows, blackout curtains, desks, fireplace - just gorgeous! the only thing that did not really fit was the bathroom which was decorated quite starkly and the shower head wa broken away from the wall. | room service was prompt and lovely - breakfast the next day was room service to the room. i ordered just one full breakfast and that filled the 4 of us! enough toast, croissants, juice. tea, milk and full fry up to go round!! which was handy considering the price. | on checkout we were allowed to leave our baggage and car at the hotel until we collected them after being out all day in london. | really the service is outstanding, the hotel is an icon and fabulous and the prices should be high - otherwise it would not be the treat its supposed to be would it ? and we would all go every time in london!

The Lanesborough,"'''i visited the bar and restaurant here with my husband and we had an amazing night. this is my new favourite hotel, still has an old english feel like stepping back into a more glamorous day unlike many other hotels in london which are very modern and far too busy. a great gem i will definitely be returning to.'''",2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel captures you from the moment you walk in the door. you are surrounded by the most relaxing interiors and contemporary innovative floral displays that invites you to relax and leave the hustle and bustle of london outside. everywhere you turn, from the atrium to the restaurant is a pleasure. the service is outstanding, the choice of restaurants and bars is exciting and 'cool'. the design and interiors of the bedrooms and suite are good enough to take home. thank you to all at the corinthia for a wonderful stay and delivering on your promise of making our wedding one of the most memorable days of our lives. we will always remember the corinthia with fondness.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i have stayed here twice over the past two years, and i cannot think of anywhere else i would rather stay in london. the location -- on the border of fitzrovia and bloomsbury -- is great. close to the british museum, two tube lines, and lots of restaurants. it is a small family run hotel, not posh, but clean and well run. and for central london, the prices cannot be beat! i stayed in a single, shared bath for 52 pounds a night last year. this year i returned with 2 friends and we had a triple room with 3 single beds and an en-suite bath for 135 pounds per night. the cooked breakfast is good, with lots of choices. and the owners will help you plan out where you are going, what tube or bus to take, etc. the resident's lounge has a coke machine and free coffee or tea available whenever you want them. also a computer you can use to access the internet. all in all, a great place to hang your hat in london.'''",2

Rhodes Hotel,"'''i have stayed at the rhodes hotel on a number of occassions for business, and also now use them for leisure stays as i cannot fins fault with the service, the rooms or the quality of the breakfast. perfectly positioned near to paddington mainline and undergrounds, with a selection of bars and restaurants nearby, i stayed here this time with my sister in law to travel to wembley and it took 30 minutes door to door. as usual the service was impeccable with friendly staff and management, and the room was great with a comfy bed, tea and coffee facilities and air con. i would highly recommend the rhodes hotel for business or leisure.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''my husband and i stayed at the rembrant for a week in may and could not have been happier with our choice of hotel. we selected a club king room. having heard that all the rooms were very small, we were very happy with the size of our room. it was such a quiet and lovely area, so nice to come back to after the long hours of sightseeing in london. there were many restaurants in the area that were superb (bumpkin was my favorite). and you could not ask for a closer walk to a tube station. the english breakfast every morning was hearty to start your day. we were so pleased with this hotel and would strongly recommend it to any couple traveling to london.'''",2

| the spa: | we went to have a look at the spa. the receptionist was surprisingly a bit frosty and uninterested offering us an ipad tour which we politely declined. they have an understandable policy for specific times for children. no matter. | as we walked off am male colleague quickly caught up with us to professionally explained the children policy and apologise. for me he recovered the first discussion really well. | we decided to visit the spa the following day at the right time. this visit was good but it seems apparent that it is independently managed as the ""we value you"" approach you get in the hotel is not there. the spa itself is wonderful but i think there is a training requirement here i suspect it is managed by espa. more could be made of this if they were to get then service right as per the rest of the building, an easy fix for someone to grab on to. | the bar: | a warm welcome but the chap behind the bar who recognised me from when i was last here. we loved it and were made to feel very special. had a glass of sav blanc each and the kids had devine lemonade. served with extras such as amazing olives etc. well done. this chap is excellent and a mind of information - really impressed | we were so impressed that we went the following evening and unsurprisingly it was excellent with great service and respect throughout. | servicing of rooms: | the turndown service when we arrived back from dinner was impressive. beds read with 4 dressing gowns beautifully laid out. everything was neat and tidy added to which the lady who i am guessing had done it was friendly and chatty in the corridor. | well done - could not have been better. | breakfast: | unbeatable and attentive. every meat, fruit, cereal, bread, tea,coffee,you could ever ask for. but.....so attentive. offers to go and top up juice. plates cleared as soon as cutlery crossed. | they have got this just right. | lobby: | decor is stunning - lots of places to sit whether as a group, an intimate one to one or a private business meeting. this focuses on a central area which is gorgeous and the sound proofing works so you ate not homing in unintentionally on other discussions. | there is an outside courtyard with cool sofa seating and an open fire at each end which makes it ideal for smokers, meetings etc. | t the rear entrance it feels like the reception as there is a further open area which leads on to a florist (amazing orchids) and a mini harrods which is quite something. | front door: | after dinner on the second night we arrived home with the kids and the guys on the door were smiling and welcoming us ""home"" - so polite and so interested to check that we had a great night | summary: | the best hotel in london in which i have stayed. | this hotel has pride, a heart beat and a personality. they strive to excel. you feel that they all really bond as a team with everyone knowing what is required of them. they are in it for the long term. | the staff are like a family and they all seem to really gel. everyone greets you with a cost free but valuable smile. it is a happy place - a real home from home that we all dream of. | i have tweeted, face bkd and linkedin my thoughts and the hotel came back within minutes to say thanks for the tweet! that is impressive. someone obviously embraces social media and acknowledges that this is how folk ( like me) communicate and more importantly research ahead of meetings, meals and stays...all of which spread the word and generate initial and ongoing income. | would i return and would i recommend - most definitely.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we stayed here for a 2 night city break in london. i do not think i can find any fault in the hotel. the staff were so welcoming and helpful. the room was beautiful - king size bed, flat screen tv and a huge bath and shower in the bathroom. did i mention, complimentary pringles, jelly beans, hot chocolate and a rubber duck? :) it is the little things! the location of the hotel was ideal. | we were going in to the city to see a musical and there are so many underground stations within a ten minute walk from the hotel. it was so easy to get around from where the hotel is located. the guys at reception were also very helpful when we needed directions to go somewhere. thumbs up from me!'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''would definitely stay again. | pros: | very clean | nice breakfast | nice location, near bus &amp; subway station | friendly staff | cons: | room is very small | the shower was fixed in a low position, and, as i am a tall person, i had to sort of crouch to take a shower. but the space of the shower was tight, so it was a bit complicated.'''",2
The Rembrandt,'''spent an excellent two days in this hotel. it surpassed out expectations at every turn. in fact the only complaint i could make is that the toast provided for my room service breakfast was soggy! i will happily use them again on my next trip to london.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''as many have said previously....wow! the corinthia provides the whole 5 star package in a modern, thoughtful, and quintessentially british way. virtually impossible to fault from the doormen &amp; concierge on first arrival (our bags were out of our hands within a few steps inside the building), though the room, breakfast, spa &amp; checkout. | it is hard to put your finger on it exactly, but what the corinthia gets so right is the subtlety, genuine enthusiasm and lack of pretentiousness whilst providing a true 'old school' 5 star service. | particular mention to emily who checked us in. nothing was too much effort for her including showing us to our room (without us asking, just standard service) and taking us on a quick tour of the hotel, at our request, to show us the main areas including the spa. | a birthday cake and present were waiting in the room for our daughter. she was delighted, a lovely touch - many thanks. | the spa &amp; pool were amazing. again what the corinthia gets right here is letting the children use the pool area for set times during the day. peace for the adults for the most part of the day (and i fully understand that, when you are paying considerable money to enjoy world class spa facilities), yet time for the little ones to enjoy themselves too. a well balanced solution. | breakfast was excellent, our host, anneka(?), seemed genuinely happy to serve us. | it is not cheap to stay at the corinthia (but nor are any 5 star london hotels), but i still think it is good value for money - you really do get what you pay for. we will be back......maybe without the children!'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''having stayed at several of the top hotels in london (the ritz, the halken, four seasons) the mandarin oriental hyde park is the only place i want to ever stay in london. the attention to detail, the magnificent service and of course, the location, make it the ultimate london experience. a beautiful historic building but with a totally renovated and state of the art gym and pool make it positively worth every penny. (and let us be honest, it costs several millions of pennies!) the go-to hotel for celebrities who want privacy too--we spotted hugh jackman in the gym ! (who needs another reason to work out?) | thanks again to the staff for making our wedding anniversary a booming success!'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''the hotel looks really impressive from the outside, and very tastefully decorated inside. our room was very small, but very plush and the bathroom was spotless with lovely occitane products for us to use. | my only complaint is that the cocktails in the bar were very expensive, around 10 and then we got charged a service charge on top which i thought was a bit cheeky! | overall, we enjoyed our stay and can highly recommend this hotel'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''it is not very often that i post a flattering review of a hotel but exceptions need to be made and mandarin took all the efforts into making my stay exceptional! | having stayed at jumeirah carlton and the w in london, i thought i would give mo a try and was i glad i did. compared to most other hotels in this league and others at knightsbridge, mandarin is head and shoulders above the rest. | their attention to detail is astounding as it their anticipation of guests needs. the rooms are immaculate, service levels as good as east asia (most other hotels in london have no idea what service means), and their personal touch seals the deal. | some of the touches that made my trip truly memorable - b&amp;o tv with 100's of channels, two easy to use telephones in the room (one with wireless handset), easy to reach charging sockets aptly located at the work station/ desk (which also folds out for extra space), excellent ipod/phone dock with built in alarm/ radio, placing of bookmarks in my books, excellent toiletries, and a fully stocked bar with choice of glasses including a fully filled ice bucket in the fridge at all times! | whilst checking out i was asked if there was any other way that the hotel could assist me with my trip/ travel/ anything at all. now that is five star all the way... | i have since received a follow up mail to the generic survey most hotels send out and this time their resident manager actually responded to my recommended improvement areas with what the hotel had planned in the future. kudos to a team that is been trained to excel in all areas!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''anyone can name all the big names in the hospitality world in england, but one that stands out for it is traditional decor and sharp services is the savoy. it was my 2nd stay and i remained impress with the level of service distinction that they continued since my last visit 9 months ago. the butlers were attentive with seeing to your requests and were most accommodating. the residential feel in the lobby brings you back to the yesteryear era and after spending hours in the city, it is always nice to come 'home'. the location is great with covent garden adjacent to the strand, walking distance to trafalgar square and chinatown. you cannot get any better than the savoy on location with the other big names in london. this will remain my preferred accommodation for my future visits.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''went for afternoon tea and had the accompanying champagne. on arrival took advantage of the american bar as we were a little early. the selection of cocktails was impressive and the two we chose were magnificent , fail to see how you could go wrong. the service was attentive the accompanying nibbles terrific, but we did not want to spoil our afternoon tea to follow! the transfer to the tea area was seamless and that area is gorgeous. the service again as good as i have had anywhere. the champagne was quality and the tiers of sandwiches and scones delicious. i think there were any number of birthdays being celebrated by other punters, all of us appeared to be making our debut, lots of photos being taken. the sandwiches were replenished as a matter of course, the selection of teas endless, but the savoy afternoon choice was again sensational. the cakes that followed were terrific too. hard to imagine you could be so full on the back of an afternoon tea, i was defeated by what was on offer. highly recommended at about 50 plus each a throw, believe me it was excellent value and outstanding quality. everyone should treat themselves at least once to this experience. faultless and i have seldom been able to afford that description of anywhere.you need to book a fair old time in advance, but enjoy the anticipation as it is worth the wait. full marks.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i wondered if other reviews were too good to be true, as the price is such a great value. this place was great. it is family run, warm and friendly. one of the owners recommended i go a couple of blocks over to charlotte street, where there are plenty of restaurants and outdoor cafes. a neighborhood in the middle of it all. they have a lovely back yard, where you can sit in nice outdoor furniture beneath the trees. what a tranquil oasis! there is no lift or air conditioning. it was no big deal in mid may. the single room with private bathroom was not huge, but big enough. it was quiet. the bed was comfy. the breakfast was really nice. they offered cereal and juice to start. they made eggs and english bacon and a third hot item, that would change: grilled tomato, baked beans, banger sausage. all good. toast, with seconds offered. good coffee. it was an easy 20-30 minute walk to most west end theaters. wi-fi worked great. i would definitely stay there again.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''stayed for a weekend at the end of november. good location and had a large room over looking hyde park. staff were impeccable, from the concierge to the cleaner who greeted us with a nice smile and ""hello"". yes it was expensive - but we do not do this very often so a nice treat and the hotel stay is part of the holiday. | only one gripe - they could not find space for us to sample afternoon tea! even if we were residents. never mind we went to harrods and enjoyed their afternoon tea instead. | also, great place to people watch, seen a few ""faces"" over the weekend. but i particularly liked watching the very posh middle aged lady trying to work out how to operate the lifts - after a couple of attempts (doors open - step in - door shuts - door opens - she is still there?) she approaches the concierge who without batting an eyelid or demeaning her in any way escorts her to the lift and onward to her room - that is good service.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''staff were uniformly helpful and efficient. the rooms were spacious and well equipped given the central location. away from the bustle of the touristy areas yet very convenient for getting around. food was reasonable rather than gourmet standard. great value!''',2
The Savoy,"'''from the first minute to the last i have never experienced such quality and attention to detail. it is not cheap, but by far superior to any hotel i have ever previously stayed. | one more knocked off the bucket list.'''",2
The Savoy,'''me n my boyfriend stayed at this hotel few days ago and i can honestly say it is truely amazing!! the thing that makes it truely amazing is the staff!! the staff r sooooo friendly and treat you like royalty. they cannot do enough for you!! the room was quite small but still very nice and o my god the bed was sooooo comfy! the marble bathroom was very classy!! the breakfast in the morning was delicious and the orange juice they give you is to die for!! the best tasting fresh orange juice i have ever tasted!! the hotel bar is also amazing and once again the staff were outstanding. i can understand why it won the worlds best bar! anyway i will stop waffling now but you will not be disappointed with this hotel.''',2
The Savoy,"'''stayed at the savoy for two nights a little while back and was most impressed. i have been fortunate to stay in several top-notch london hotels as well as one or two less 'well known', for my money the savoy is the best hotel experience in london. | i arrived by black cab to be greeted by the doorman, he asked if i was checking in and promptly whisked my bags away. into the beautiful lobby area which is at first quite small and into the 'check in room', they do not have desks instead opting for a seated check-in. i was shown to my deluxe room which was beautifully appointed. as i am sure everyone knows, this hotel has had a major refurbishment but they have retained the charm of the hotel whilst bringing it into this millennium! my room was spacious as was the bathroom which i swear was as big as the bedroom itself, albeit accessed by a very narrow door - quite a bizarre set-up but rather charming. | location of the hotel is spot-on, right in the heart of theatre land, and the staff like most fairmont trained staff are there to serve and get it just right, none of the pomp and ceremony you get from some other 'ritzy' establishments, just a common sense approach to making your stay a welcome one. | breakfast in the river restaurant is excellent, albeit i found the service a little 'too much', perhaps one becomes accustomed to a lack of service sometimes. had a couple of drinks both in the lobby and in the incredibly chintzy beaufort bar, the cocktails are excellent and priced at what you would expect for this calibre of hotel, and the beds are amazingly comfortable. | there was little i could fault the savoy on to be honest, everything during my stay was fantastic, i am looking forward to returning.'''",2
The Rembrandt,'''i think the other reviews say everything - a good hotel in a great location. nice room size for london. pretty good value. good food. everything very plesent. staff seemed very good from my limited interaction with them. searching travel websites found them cheapest to book directly. a definate recommendation for anyone visiting the v&amp;a or natural history museum. very well located!''',2
The Savoy,"'''i have stayed at the savoy a handful of times and have enjoyed each stay. service is smooth, restaurants and bars are great, hotel is quiet. all-in-all, a great hotel. what i have not figured out is the rooms. the rooms are beautifully decorated but the sizes are not constant, which, is part of the charm of the hotel! sometimes the rooms are tiny and sometimes enormous. with the smaller rooms there is not enough desk-top space to put down a laptop and do some work. something to bear in mind if you do need to work while staying at the savoy.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we recently stayed 5 nights with our friends. from the 9 am early check-in to our last dinner in the northall, our stay could not have been better. our entire london experience was made that much better by having stayed at the corinthia. others have noted the overall ambiance, facilities and staff, and there is no need to duplicate the praise, just affirm it. tired on the day of our arrival after touring the portobello road &amp; borough markets, we had an early pre theater menu dinner in massimo, which was delicious and although a bit light, priced for value and a good choice for that early first night. the breakfast buffet leaves nothing out, the fresh berries were unexpected, and a great start to the day. we so much enjoyed the nespresso machine in the room that we intend to buy one. i really cannot say enough good things about the corinthia and just wish there were one in each city we visit. for you foodies, the northall is not yet zagat rated, but our meal was exceptional.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''amazing hotel in a great, central location just minutes away from attractions such as the london eye. ended up staying here a few more nights than anticipated as it was so nice. will definitely stay here again when in london.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''beautiful hotel in the heart of knightsbridge, right beside london's prime shopping area. great rooms, superb restaurant. very helpful staff. concierge service excellent. the doormen are particularly attentive, always ready to help with luggage and packages.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''nice hotel, good sized room and lovely bathroom, but a lot of stairs. a plus is that it is air conditioned.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''every aspect of our experience was top notch. the service, hotel's location and interior decor were so elegant and worth the rate we paid. i definitely will be coming back to this fine hotel on my next trip to the strand.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,'''we booked in for a two night pit stop in london to do some shopping and sightseeing with our two children. the moment we entered we knew two nights would just not be enough. the entrance / lobby area sets the scene to this beautiful hotel. the staff were polite and attentive and listened to all our needs. the room was beautifully laid out and very spacious. we immediately decided upon arrival to extend one night. the location is perfect close to everything and the housekeeping staff were superb. there were a few little things we needed changing in the room and the staff listened and actioned anything we requested. | on the sunday we wanted to be back at the hotel for afternoon but got held up and arrived a little late. the room service staff were kind enough to provide what we requested in our room. | overall a wonderful stay and we will be back next time we are in london as this is now our new favourite hotel.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,'''we have stayed in many of the top hotels in london but you must treat yourself to stay here. spacious suites and the most expensive comfortable bed you will ever sleep in. we stayed last new years eve which was superb.''',2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''stayed here on the saturday before the london marathon. staff were very friendly and helpful, spotlessly clean room and upon arrival we were given a free upgrade to a suite. will definitely return. hotels a few minutes walk from bank and moorgate tubes. |'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''after a busy family christmas we wanted a restful break at our favourite hotel. from the moment we handed the car over we switched into spoilt mode. i had made a gingerbread house for my grandchildren but i only wish they had been with us to view the dorchester showpiece. just sensational. | our suite was spacious with the most comfortable bed. the champagne and fruit was a lovely touch! | . | new years eve in the promenade lounge was perfect for us. i was a bit doubtful about eating outside of the grill on that evening but it really worked . great cocktails, a super 3 course meal served in style, dancing and more cocktails. there was a fun natural ambience with other guests and staff. eclectic yes and i felt very privileged to be part of it. | the grill is a work in process for me. we dined there on our second evening. the food was good and service is faultless but at the moment it just lacks that joie de vivre to bring it to life. maybe trying too hard but how can that be a fault. | i hope we will be back next year with the family. thank you to all the staff who looked after us so well.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''great hotel! service was awesome - staff pays attention to details and remembers the guests. loved the quality of bed, bedding and pillows! location was also convenient to many restaurants and shopping.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''me and my mum stayed for one night before going to madam tussauds, room was not huge but had two comfy larger than average single beds, nice shower and tea/coffee facilities. even though on a fairly main road was not too loud. breakfast was fine nothing special but good for being included in the price.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''ideal spot. close to south kensington tube &amp; many eateries. buses and taxis at the door. brompton road shops, hyde park, kensington palace, royal albert hall &amp; many museums. comfortable bed, and clean generally quiet rooms.we had no street noise but on both occassions we stayed in the back of the hotel. a very helpful concierge named pablo! who has a wealth of knowledge and expertise. excellent spa/pool next door inside the hotel complex. excellent buffet breakfast.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''found the hotel welcoming and the staff very friendly and helpful. | stayed in the annexe around the corner in sussex place.room 302 | it was compact but offered us all we needed for our one night stay. | bathroom is a tad small but it never bothered us. | room was spotless and the bed was lovely and comfy. | shops and bar in london road open late which was handy, very quiet considering how near to everything you are. | fridge in room and the air con was a god send as it was so hot so felt like a cool oasis of calm. | will definitely use this gem of a hotel again.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i would like to congratulate this hotel and the team for having such a lovely hotel with professional staff in it. we really had a fantastic and enjoyable stay at mondrian starting from checking in whom i met lea who was very professional and helpful. | the room was very clean and comfortable with an excellent view. | we tried your dandelyan bar, what a beautiful space and delicious cocktails you all have there and all the friendly bartenders who gave life of the night. | the sea containers restaurant has the greatest view. we really loved to sit next to the window but the restaurant was busy as expected. the ambiance was great as well the service. we have been taken care by yan who was very lovely, professional and passionate employee who were able to talk about the history of the company and the building, about the chef who made the menu and suggested the most delicious dishes. | i could not express how wonderful our stay was so i would like to say a big thank you to everyone who made our stay unforgetable. i will surely be back.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''this was my fourth stay at the mandarin oriental hyde park. the hotel was sold out so i was given an interior room rather than a view of knightsbridge. while there was no view (the window only opened a few inches) the room was still pleasant with a king bed, ample storage and an elegant decor. the best reason to stay here is the location--the finest in london--great for shopping but close enough to the west end theatres. service at the hotel is pleasant--even with the very high occupancy. the bar is a scene best enjoyed by those under 25 years of age--but the park restaurant is quite pleasant.'''",2
The Lanesborough,"'''smooth transfer hotel car from lcy. upgrade to apsley suite, tasteful and comfortable. | complimentary champagne,fruit,water etc. excellent service from all of the helpful and friendly staff,butler,concierge,manager, everyone.this is lhw at its best.great breakfast,best eggs royal for a while.very good quick lunch ,fish and chips in the library bar were perfect. | tip,london is busy all year ,saturday before xmas hectic,avoid weekends if you want to shop oxford st.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''check in was easy &amp; even though we were early our room was ready. | room was gorgeous with a fantastic view, although air con could have been better, was way too hot! | hotel is adjacent to the oxo tower so fantastic if you plan to eat there &amp; stay over. the hotel has a great rooftop bar, really cool vibe with a good mix of people &amp; great music provided by a resident dj. there is also some outside space but the bar atmosphere is lost out there. the major flaw we found is that nearly every seated area is reserved so as paying guests you are not even offered an an area which is quite poor. the bar was under pressure &amp; we had to queue for champagne for a good 15mins whilst the waitresses chatted amongst themselves and they did not approach us once to ask if we wanted anything. | one final point is i think for the price of the rooms they could offer some sort of continental breakfast, would be a nice touch. | moans aside we had a lovely time!'''",2
The Dorchester,'''i brought my daughter to london for her 25th birthday and as a treat we stayed at the dorchester ... they are the experts! | everything was perfect the staff are so charming without exception the hotel so tasteful and they knew it was her birthday and the birthday cake and champagne such a lovely touch! the hotel has a reputation so justly deserved there is nowhere to beat it . it may be quite expensive but it is worth every penny!!''',2

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my wife booked a weekend here for me for my 40th birthday, the hotel is great, staff very professional and friendly, the thermal floor area was great just what i needed and the rooms beautiful. breakfast in the room was excellent and a great way to start the day, id love to go back, maybe ill remortgage the house next time as it was very expensive, but worth every penny. | the only criticism i had is the room always felt a bit warm, the air conditioning was a bit asthmatic and it would turn itself off when you were not in the room. we always had to turn it back on when we returned as the room was too warm. but other than that i could not fault it! | we ate at the massimo restaurant which was very good too, and had a cocktail in the bassoon bar too which was superb. go there for a weekend you will not be disappointed!'''",2

Rhodes Hotel,'''i had a flight from heathrow the next day and did not want to leave the city center. i believe it was one of the best choice. staff was friendly and helpful. very close to paddington station and hyde park. rooms are small but this is because of the building. it is nice and old type london building. breakfast was simple but more than enough. would be preferred with families as well.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''we arrived at 7am after a 21 hour journey from australia and the polite and helpful reception staff found us a room immediately. breakfast was great and the variety and service were also very good. our rooms were very comfortable and extremely clean, top marks for house keeping. we stayed for 5 nights and as the hotel is opposite the victoria &amp; albert museum we were well placed for the natural history and science museum too. harrods, harvey nicholls and hyde park are all a short stroll away and the city and oxford street are also very close to this hotel. i would recommend the rembrandt to anyone wanting to be close to the city and where comfort and cleanliness is a priority.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''this was our family first visit to london. when we arrived at the front door at the savoy, it was everything that was described on their website. we were greeted by the head doorman tony, luggage handler peter, they treated our family like stars. after a long flight that really impressed our family.the check in service was great by claudette, she made sure we had everything we needed for our accommodation during our stay, she advised us our room will be ready within half an hour and she will give us an orientation of the hotel and if we were hungry she can take us to the restaurant for lunch. she introduce us to the hostess at thames foyer,angelic (angel), her service was amazing for our meals at the kasper/thames foyer and watch her worked the room she really cares for all the guests in the room. we had lunch in kasper room, we had the table by the window facing the thames river. we were served by michael, his service was great. finally we went to our room after amazing lunch at the kasper. the room was was set up nicely with our luggage in the room. later in the evening we returned room, turndown service done for our room was amazing. the service at the savoy is five stars, all the staff members makes the point to remember all their guest names and treating them like stars. the impression on our first day will be a lasting impression for family being treated like stars from the savoy, which made our stay in our london spectacular. high tea at the savoy is the best. | mho'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''wow what can i say? i booked this hotel for my husband and i to stay at from 20th march for 3 nights and it did not disappoint. we were up in london to celebrate my birthday, youngest daughter's birthday, early wedding anniversary and my eldest daughter getting her dream job up in london. | from signing in to signing out the staff were all fabulous and very attentive. nothing was too much trouble for them. | we had booked a riverview balcony suite where we could enjoy the wonderful views of the thames and st paul's cathedral whilst enjoying a coffee on the balcony and when we came back to the hotel in the evening the staff had lit lamps on the balcony which added to the fantastic atmosphere. | because we had a packed itinerary we did not eat at the hotel but had a look at the restaurants and the menus and will definitely make time next time we visit to dine there. | the views from the rumpus room was spectacular an absolute must for anyone wanting to go for a celebratory drink in london - this is the place to go! | the hotel is very modern and stylish and just awesome. it even has its own cinema! location is great near blackfriars tube station. | we had a lovely card and bottle of champagne in our room on arrival. thank you to all the staff for making our visit so memorable. we will definitely be back.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''went here for 1 night wedding anniversary; the location is fabulous on the thames just in front of st paul, on south bank..the hotel itself is great if you like very modern, trendy places but i found it a bit ""cold"" ,lacking a bit of heart or charm...do not get me wrong it s a great place to go: service, food, bedrooms but missing a ""je ne sais quoi"" that makes at the end a difference with hotels in the same category'''",2
The Savoy,"'''whenever i am in london, i stay at the savoy. after it was reopened following its refurbishment, i have stayed in several of the rooms, including a recent stay where i stayed in a personality suite on the 4th floor with river view. | the room was delightfully airy and spacious. the view is quite incredible. the little touches are what makes this hotel marvellous however. the 24 hour attentive butler service, whom never hover waiting for a tip when they have served you. the fact that i usually travel with my celiac partner and yet they can make all foods to her liking, and she never suffers an allergic reaction. the hot room service, the first class fitness suite and 3rd floor pool with top atrium. i recently travelled with a type 1 diabetic, whom they modified the menu for, and even served his food in the beaufort bar which they would not usually allow - but they never say no here and they will go far beyond expectations. | the others in my party stayed in a junior suite which was very nice. lovely bath with walk in shower, and spacious. the hotel staff are all trained to perfection, and are polite and friendly in any circumstances. booking a vehicle to take you to a specific destination (we had a function to attend) was done with similar ease. taxi's are immediately available out front, and there is always a taxi regardless of the time of day/night. | put together the level of service, the hotel rooms, the genuine care put into every stay, the location and the ease of the whole experience, and you would never want to stay anywhere else again. when in central london, i never stay anywhere else! | just a word of thought for the hotel - the rooms are expensive to purchase outright. as such, i always purchase a cheaper room, then take advantage of the often 1/3 of the price 'standby' upgrade system. i always get the room i upgrade to unless it is around a special event or time of year in london. makes me wonder why they bother putting the rooms on so expensive, because it deters people from purchasing them, before giving them all away at half the price as no-one has purchased them! just seems a bit of an odd way of doing things (it was not like this when the hotel re-opened, but lately that seems the way things work!) | so, an amazing hotel indeed. simply the best in london, the most central, and a lot less 'chintzy' than the ritz, which is outdated now and not close enough to central london. congratulations to all the staff on winning second prize in the best cocktail bar competition also - the american bar is a thing of beauty!'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed for 2 nights and found the hotel to be well positioned for the museums and knightsbridge shops. there is a tube station nearby and so the location was ideal for our visit. our room was spacious and clean and was well stocked with refreshments etc. we stayed on a fairly stormy night and we were kept awake with the wind whistling through the fire escape door outside the room. the bed was comfortable but we did find the room cold probably due to the draft coming down the hallway. breakfast is buffet style and is a busy affair with a selection of cooked breakfast, pastries and yogurt. it was tasty but could have been improved with some fresh fruit and possibly more staff. we would stay again based on location.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London",'''the location is perfect. great staff. the restaurants are really good especially boulod. the hotel has what some may refer to as old world charm. we tend to prefer more modern hotels. i felt the rooms could use a renovation. if you can get a room overlooking the park you will love the view.''',2
The Savoy,'''we were met on arrival and taken to our room facing the thames. | afternoon tea was a treat. | savoy theatre on site opposite savoy grill. | hotel close to theatre land and covent garden. | excellent location. excellent 3 day stay. | we will be back.''',2
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here with wife, daughter and mother-in-law. brilliant location. close to harrods / harvey nichols and numerous restaurants. tube station round the corner. | free broadband in the rooms (stopped working one morning and the staff were very apologetic and got it fixed later that day). | nice breakfast. clean rooms. comfortable beds.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''booked by my boyfriend as a treat for my birthday. we mentioned this via the online chat service and were upgraded! the bags we had dropped off earlier that day were already waiting in our room on the 7th floor. another surprise awaited me as there was rose petals on the bed, a handwritten card from the hotel staff and towels made into a swan heart!! the room had a terrace with table and chairs and a view of the share if you went right to the edge in one direction. the only negative i would say is the room looked straight into offices nearby and it looked like the room next door, if they opened their curtains would look straight out onto our terrace. the toiletries in the bathroom were excellent as was the deep bath, large shower and fluffy towels and robes. the bed was super comfy with loads of pillows. we loved having a sofa and the blu-ray player with free rentals from reception. the coffee machine and tea making facilities were also great. we would happily stay in another apex hotel when visiting london. thank you very much!'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''i stayed here on july 1st 2014 with my brother to see coldplay at the royal albert hall. i have multiple sclerosis and have mobility issues so requested a room with as little stairs to climb. they took my needs into consideration as we ended up with the twin room on the ground floor (behind reception) it was small, but enough room for both of us. the toilet and shower were again very small but not a problem it was very nice with a recent refurb. staff we met were lovely and very friendly and accommodating. it was hot with an average of 26c that day so air con was a huge plus. the bed was comfortable and clean. breakfast (included in the price) was nice between 7-10am, with cereal, toast yogurts, fruit, tea, coffee orange juice, water, for an extra 6 full english. the only bad or negative thing was the dining room was small with crowded tables and the fact it was downstairs made things a little difficult but manageable. the hotel is not brand spankingly new but it is charming and would stay here again in a heartbeat. book direct on their website as it is cheaper. | the hotel is a short distance from lancaster gate underground station (central line) and same distance to hyde park a walk through hyde park would get you to the royal albert hall and not overly expensive for taxis too and from. the room included a folio with nearby restaurants details of theatres, churches, main attractions etc... this hotel is not cheap but i can safely say it is priced adequately. if you want a decent nights sleep a clean comfortable bed this is a good choice. do not bother about people nit-picking at a few cracks in the skirting or bad decor it is an old building and there is a reason for this (it is not bad) great hotel no problems.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''great hotel, service is amazing. concierge worked hard at getting us some great theatre tickets. food in the thames foyer &amp; savoy grill is superb. situated on embankment and a couple of minutes stroll from covent garden.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''this hotel is everything and more.the pictures do not do the rooms justice, as you walk in they have the wow factor, very impressive. from the online booking to our departure everything was excellent. package included dinner and full breakfast both of which were of a very high standard and the waiting staff treated us like royalty. wish we could have stayed longer, but will certainley recommend to anyone who is looking for excellent accommodation and when we are in london again will be booking in. | thank you to all the staff who made our stay in london a memorable one.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''wonderful hotel with beautiful room, stunning common areas, and a very glamorous bar for a drink at the end of the day. the room was very spacious and the bathroom was really nice with a fantastic shower. excellent service. goes without saying that the spa is also amazing. all in all, it is the ideal place to stay while in london.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''this is my third stay in the mondrian due to its location for my office. the reception area has some great nautical design twists - the staff are friendly. the rooms are not that big and i know space is a premium in any city but they are a bit tight. not keen on the interiors of the rooms - they are trying too hard - the air con only goes down to 19 celsius - too hot for sleeping in - the fan is noisy so you end up sleeping with it off and there are no opening windows. some of the views are fantastic - | if you are elevated and either over looking the thames or to the east or west the landmarks are great. restaurant - | expensive for what is in essence an upmarket steak house.''',2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''the corinthia is a new hotel by london standards, but has been created with a traditional london feel. the staff are super helpful, very professional and you can tell they have been rigorously trained. | the rooms are big, high tech, excellent beds, and the bathrooms are an experience in themselves- huge mutli-sprayer shower, separate (roomy) toilet cubicle, and an enormous bath with a tv and waterproof remote control! | the hotel has a number of eating and drinking venues, all top notch, and is located bang in the middle of whitehall- you can feel the machinery of government around you. | if you book via expedia or similar online booking services, you can get very good rates. | will definitely be back.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''a deliberate visit to the dorchester bar for drinks. after a late and long lunch, we went to the bar to get the best (in my opinion) expresso martinis in london. it is always great to see the amazing service that the hotel delivers.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''very pretty hotel, very small room but very clean, updated and romantic! very well located near pubs, restaurants, 2 metro stations, supermarket, etc. very nice safe area! | great costumer service, the airline lost one of our bags and they worried about it the whole time, they treated us so nicely!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''this hotel was great, the staff were very helpful and the rooms were awesome!!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''my friends arranged our tea here. first time for me and my husband. | what a beautiful lobby. the tea time was wonderful. great selections of tea sandwiches and wonderful dessert choices. very generous with offerings. | each of us tried a different tea, as well as champagne. | everything was very nice. a memorable dinning experience for us all.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''from getting out of the car at the start of our trip the stay at the savoy was really brilliant. the hotel is luxury and class but not overwhelming. the staff are friendly efficient and nothing is too much trouble. rooms are beautifully decorated with old world charm and elegance of a bygone era, you feel like someone special here. the american bar was fantastic great cocktails. i went there for just a quick break and felt like staying forever, definitely going back.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''this was pleasant surprise! it was clean and cheerful. the breakfasts were delicious and very hearty. the staff would ask each day. ""where off to today?"" then they might suggest a better route or let us know we were on the right track! i appreciated their friendly and helpful atmosphere.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''although we only stayed for 1 night, the service was exceptional and our needs were always met. the staff were more then friendly and quick at providing anything we asked for or answering our questions. | we had dinner at the hotel restaurant and a waiter called samuel served us. he was lovely and made sure we were taken care of at all times. very friendly and talkative. the food arrived quicker than we were expecting and the quality was outstanding for the price. | we were more than happy at this hotel and i would definitely go again!'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we have just returned after a 4 night stay at the ridgemount and i must say all our expectations were met.the hotel is only a 15 min walk from kings cross station.the hotel itself is on a busy road and as we had a room facing the street passing traffic, especially buses can make it difficult to get to sleep straight away,so ask for a room at the rear of the hotel if you can.that said i would return whatever room i had, my wife is not so sure. | the hotel is not modern but it is very clean and comfortable with a decent bathroom,fresh towels and beds made up daily.if you like a drink first thing take a kettle,we did not but with free tea/coffee in the lounge it did not bother us at all. | breakfast was served in a very bright and clean air conditioned dining room by some very friendly staff,and was of good quality, although it could hardly be described as a full english with only 3 things on your plate on any given day but there was plenty of cerials juice toast tea/coffee,so all in all enough to keep you going. | the owners were very pleasant and always on hand to offer advice on now to get to various place in and around london,very useful. | there is also free internet at the hotel if you need it. | the location is really handy 5 mins to the tube,buses outside the hotel,or if like you like to walk just 10-15 mins walk to oxford street. | to sum up we would definitely return simply because of the price,location and cleanliness of this lovely hotel'''",2
The Savoy,'''had a lovely lunch in kaspar for boxing day lunch. service was superb and the price of the menu was exceptional for such a renowned hotel. excellent value for money and a fantastic place to enjoy with the family before the theatre. food was presented beautifully and generous portions. wine was reasonably priced for a hotel or this stature. will come back for sure.''',2
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''we spent a night at the bulgari. we chose it due to combination of the location, the facilities and the sheer indulgence, and we both very much enjoyed our stay there. | the design of the hotel is ultra modern but comfortable and welcoming. it prides itself on its service - as you would expect for the price - and the service is excellent. i like it that they take you for a tour when you arrive before showing you to your room, for instance, and all the staff are helpful. | the room was excellent. very comfortable. the bathroom was nicely designed with tons of marble, a great shower and a sunken bath. what i particularly like about it was that it was well designed as well as functional. the whole hotel actually is like that - even the corridors are very grand. | the facilities are also good. the large pool for instance was great. shame the vitality pool part was not working when we were there. enjoyed the steam rooms also. | it there was a 4.5 star option i would give it that. it is a far better hotel in my opinion that the nearby mandarin oriental for instance. my only feedback to improve it still further is to amend the thermostat as the room was quite warm even when we reduced the temperature as far as it would go, and the breakfast was just a little bland and needs improving with better options (e.g. different omelettes etc). but i would certainly come here again. it is expensive but you get what you pay for.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''my family of 5 plus our babysitter traveled to london for a week. it was my kids' (and the sitter's) first trip to europe and the savoy made it the most wonderful experience. we had a suite plus a double room...apparently double rooms are hard to find in the eu, so we were so thankful. the staff were warm and helpful, the food was amazing and by the end of our week, we knew so many staff by name. | the hotel has a small indoor pool that our kids enjoyed using most late afternoons. it was a welcome rest for us all after our days spent walking the city. | the location on the strand made for easy walking to most attractions. our kids and sitter felt comfortable venturing out on their own for dinner two of our 7 nights. there are many local places that the kids loved. | we did not do afternoon tea at the savoy and for that i am disappointed. it was simply a scheduling issue, nothing to do with the hotel. i hope when my husband and i return later this year i will be able to enjoy it as it looked so lovely. | we would never be able to do better than the savoy. it is pricey, but i appreciate value for my money and this hotel was worth every single penny. we cannot wait to return!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i spent 2 nights for a conference at the corinthia and found it excellent. let us start with the only negative: service at the bar was lousy. for the rest, everything was really great. reception was efficient and friendly (and english speaking...), staff in the hotel asked if they could help when i was looking for the bathrooms (in other hotels they simply ignore you), restaurant food at massimo was good, service ok, the rooms are actually rather large for london and i liked the design (not too much bling-bling, practical, quite air conditioning, super large bathroom with super large bathtub). spa and fitness are simply fabulous with really cool design. there is also a pool (so if i want to be a pain i could say that it could be a bit longer...). conclusion: a really great place in london...if you are ready to pay the expensive price'''",2
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''thank you bvlgari for an amazing stay. me and my husband visit london quite often and usually stay at claridges but i saw that the bvlgari had opened, and after staying in milan we thought we would give it a try. we visited for stayed for a week. it is not cheap but the quality of the decor and the staff make up for that. all of the staff from david at front desk to coner in the bar made us all feel so good and really took care of us, even remembered our name and exactly how we liked our coffee each morning. the only downside was the room service, it took a long time for food to come. except that it was an exceptional stay. if you stay make sure to visit the spa, one word, bliss, one of the best spas i have seen in a city hotel. food in il ristorante is superb so too is service, topped off with a post dinner drink in the chic bar.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''this hotel stands out from the rest in the area, it is even better than the pictures, very clean, professional staff, good location, rooms are fine, breakfast good be better but not bad at all, and happy atmosphere and ambience at a reasonable price compared to london prices'''",2
The Savoy,"'''the savoy is one of the most famous and exclusive hotels in london and certainly lives up to this status. excellent location and staff very pleasant. high wifi connection charges were an irritation that tarnished an otherwise 5 star experience, at the cost of the room this really should be an inclusive feature.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''there is no doubt it would be very difficult to fault this hotel where the emphasis is very much on customer service. the hotel is known the world over and has a list of many famous guests. the whole atmosphere of the hotel is one of grandeur but, in many ways, we did not feel totally relaxed and at home. our suite was beautifully furnished, the meals were exquisitely prepared and presented and all the staff bent over backwards to make life as easy as possible but, for us, there were a few home comforts missing. for example it would have been nice to be able to make our own cup of tea or coffee when we wanted it rather than have to order it through the butler service and wait for it to arrive. in spite of its position between the strand and the thames embankment our particular room had no view at all, not that it mattered that much for a one night stay but we were a little surprised it was somewhat enclosed. the pianist during afternoon tea was definitely worth listening to making that part of the day very relaxing and enjoyable. i do not think we have ever sat on such comfortable and expansive seats during any dining experience in an hotel and the feeling of spaciousness was certainly appreciated.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''we selected the dorchester for our final few nights after being on the road for a month so we could finish off with a little comfort and style. all staff we came into contact with were attentive and exceedingly polite who always appeared genuinely interested and keen to please. the decor the restaurants and public areas was plush, luxuriant and yet welcoming. food quality was exceptional. beds were excellent and gave us the best nights sleep in a month. the upgrade to a suite was also much appreciated - thankyou! | overall, perhaps the best hotels we have stayed in across the globe and would certainly recommend it, and will return.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,'''enjoyed my brief stay in this boutique business style hotel in the banking district. modern comfortable facilities. a little pricey but good if someone else is paying the tab. i was able to get a late night meal in the bar after normal hours. staff was friendly and accommodating. i would recommend it for a business trip. good breakfast in the dining room.''',2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''a shining star within the london hotel's scene. very friendly staff, worm welcome every day which gave us a feeling of home out of home. | rooms are compact but very comfortable. the restaurant is outstanding, huge surprise! | definitely a place to be back to in london.'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''i stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and i love the hotel a lot. first of all, the hotel is quite small, but very new and clean. it is easily access by bus and tube. it also has a large super market next door that opens up to midnight. even though, there are no restaurant next to the hotel, but with 5 minutes walk to gloucester or earl's court, you can find a lot of restaurants there. moreover, the hotel staffs are very very nice and helpful. i would recommend this hotel to anyone.'''",2
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''perfect on every level. and also has my favourite spa and pool in london. it is the perfect escape from the city stress while you are still in the city. it is my serenity spot! being usually picky when it comes to hotels, as service (reception, waiters, spa employees etc) and hygiene standards across the hotel (i have extremely high expectations there) are difficult to be matched even in the best 5 star hotels. you do not need to worry about a thing, when you walk through its doors, the staff do their best to help you, especially a receptionist that went beyond her job to help my friend sort out her hotel reservation in paris for her next trip. cannot remember the name of the receptionist (blonde young lady - apologies forgot her name). i love this hotel, it has the best scores for service, food and most importantly hygiene + the yummiest candy jars at the reception!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''a wonderful hotel. definitely worth four stars, in my opinion even more. a very quite area during the weekend, because it is in a business district, so i slept great. the food is really good too, and the staff very helpful. when they noticed i am dutch, i was helped by a dutch member of staff ;), so it is a multi-cultural place. i really enjoyed my stay here and am definitely returning when i can.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''strange interior designs and apart from the restaurant most of the public areas are quite dark, although not gloomy. it has a very modern feel. the staff are very attentive and the rooms are spotless and provide everything, including a magnifying mirror in the bathroom. very convenient for the globe or the south bank centre. easy walking distance to waterloo station or southwark tube station.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''booked through a discount hotel app we had a pleasant surprise when we arrived at the hotel and was upgraded to a beautiful suite. everything we needed was in the room, the toiletries we luxurious as was the lovely bathroom. | we only ate breakfast which we enjoyed in our room, good food. | we would definitely consider staying again, the only thing i would say is against this hotel is it is location which is not ideal if you want to be in the heart of london, a 5/10 min walk away and you are at the tube though!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we were supposed to be staying at the st james sofitel, which i am sure would have been a great hotel, but due to an error on the travel agent's part, we were upgraded to a room at the savoy. and what an upgrade! pulling in off the strand in our taxi you can tell it is going to be a luxurious stay, as the doormen take your bags and you are welcomed by a member of staff who takes you straight to your room to check in. everything about this place is beautiful, even the lifts! there are amazing paintings, vases and old style telephones at every turn in the corridors and our edwardian room (523) was no less stylish. we had a very comfy king size bed and a view over the courtyard and a large bathroom with a bath and rain shower. the toiletries are le labo and smell divine, and the mini bar is the best stocked bar i have ever seen in a hotel with ruinart champagne and charbonnel and walker chocolates! the first night we had dinner next door at simpsons-in-the-strand but were ready for breakfast the next morning. | we went down to the thames foyer, a stunning setting for breakfast, and although service was slow (we think they forgot our order the first time round), the food was great, with lots to choose from. we were in no rush, so this was not a problem, and we enjoyed being waited on and feeling like royalty. all the staff are so friendly and helpful. | before dinner we enjoyed a cocktail in the american bar, which, although not cheap, is a fun place to drink. the next day, we managed to get a table for afternoon tea, again in the thames foyer. i would advise a light breakfast and certainly no lunch if you do this, as there is a lot of delicious food here, worth the stay alone to experience this. they even served a version of will and kate's chocolate wedding cake, yum! they will also replenish anything you want more of. that evening was spent in the beaufort bar, exquisitely decorated in a black and gold deco theme, the singer even complimented me on my dress! everything about this place makes you feel special, which is what a holiday should be about. the drinks are not cheap, but despite having 5 or 6 champagne cocktails, there were no hangovers the next day, so they clearly use the good stuff! | one morning, we took breakfast in our room, and this was delivered not just on a tray, but a proper table was brought up to our room, complete with a warming oven for our toast and pancakes. it was just as good as the breakfast in the foyer, which cannot always be said for room service. | if i could afford it, i would make a stay here a regular thing!'''",2
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''really enjoyed my stays - three of them over a month. staff were wonderful, service good and food excellent. but needs to re-iterate its no smoking policy to people when they register. one lost night's sleep due to alarms (guest smoking) was not fun!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''valet parking was a god-send! four rooms were booked but when arrived they were on two different floors, they changed our rooms so all on same floor without any problems. loved that you could sit in the bar and watch the boats on the thames. if you get a taxi back to the hotel some of the drivers do not recognise the mondrian, but if you also mention sea container house, they know it straight away.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''this was our second visit to the apex london wall and our stay was as perfect as the first time. definitely my favourite hotel in londen. staff is friendly, helpfull and well organized, rooms are impeccable, cozy and modern, breakfast is tasty and fresh. and on top of that, the location is superb. just 3 tube stops from king's cross station and close to london highlights like tower bridge, borough market and spitalfields market. | i got an extra treat since it was my birthday, which i thought was an excellent touch. | we will definitely stay at the apex london wall hotel again.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we really loved this hotel and the service was excellent. our junior suite was amazing, spotlessly clean, comfortable, huge bed and probably the best bathroom ever! why only a four overall? there were a few little things, like the door handle fell off in the bathroom and i could not work out how to use the shower and had to use thre huge bath instead! mostly i think it was the resturant though. the hotel is five star but the diner was average - the veggie risotta had no flavor and the breakfast took ages and had been sitting around. we would definately stay again but use one of the very many other local places to eat. the location is fabulous. sunday morning we wondered down through the silent streets to the river to watch the london marathon, lunch in borough market and experience the view from the shard.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''our family (husband and kids 12 &amp; 14) stayed at the savoy in december for 4 nights. we had 2 connecting deluxe king rooms, they were immaculate and spacious. breakfast downstairs in the thames foyer was a highlight every morning, decorated beautifully for the holidays, service was friendly and personal, even remembering each morning the way i took my coffee before i had to ask. we also ate lunch at kaspar's which i highly recommend. my husband and i celebrated new year's eve in the lively beaufort bar, where each and every bartender and server went out of their way to take care of us with great cheer. at midnight our kids joined us outside for the spectacular fireworks show. after that we all joined in the music, dancing, and celebration that went on in the thames foyer, a perfect night! during our stay, we also had a drink in the american bar before heading out to dinner (we preferred the service and atmosphere in the beaufort), and saw a matinee of dreamgirls in the historic savoy theater attached to the hotel (phenomenal!). we really did have an ideal 4 days at the savoy, especially thanks to beauty and grandeur of the hotel and the graciousness of the staff. i have already recommended the savoy several times since we have returned home and would not consider staying anywhere else upon our next visit to london!'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''nice room(executive with extra bed) with enough space even for 3 people. the extra bed was very hard , though. nice bathroom. good breakfast, but a little slow service. a bit anonomous. quiet rooms. good location just opposite the museums and plenty of restaurants nearby. close enough to the underground.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed for 5 nights and the hotel was in a perfect location - v&amp;a museum is right across the road, natural history a block down. harrods is easily walkable the other way and kensington palace, hyde park and the royal albert are a few blocks away. south kensington station is closest and easy to get to..plenty of good pubs and restaurants to suit most tastes as you venture into chelsea. we had breakfast included in our stay but after eating twice, we decided to venture out instead. service is fine but the food is not special. lack luster sausage flavour and fatty ham/bacon each time, eggs not great, good if a continental breakfast suits you...but most of the pastries seem commercial and not very tasty either. | our queen room was impeccably clean and very quiet (faced an inside court or roof...probably better than facing brompton if you have a choice). wifi was a strong signal all the time and the tv available was a good selection of british tv channels. well outfitted modern bathroom, the tub was jetted and a good soak after a long flight and first day of walking was welcome. windows did open..we needed some fresh air as all the heat was on in nov but it did not happen to be very cold outside. | if you arrive before checkin as we did, they have a locked room in which you can leave your bags so you can venture out, they simply give you a ticket to pick them up (applied to checkout day as well). | front desk staff were polite and efficient at all times and corrected a billing error when we checked out immediately.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''my partner and i held our civil partnership at the dorchesters penthouse and pavilion and it really was the most perfect day from start to finish. | the staff are a real asset to this hotel from the doorman to the house keepers, the waiting staff and the managers. we received nothing short of exceptional service. | the food was outstanding, the park suite we stayed in mind blowing, the spa treatments heavenly, i could go on and on. | | anybody looking for the perfect wedding venue look no further than the dorchester. | a huge thank you to the dorchester and all the staff involved for making our wedding day so special. | we look forward to returning again very soon.'''",2

"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''when a special occasion demands a stay-over in london, the wellesley is our first choice. the hotel is small &amp; intimate with excellent staff who are attentive to your every needs. the bar area is small but chic with a fine selection of wines and spirits. the hotel even has its own humidity-controlled cigar room with a huge selection available and two outdoor smoking areas (for the cigar lovers out there!). this is the fourth time we have stayed here and will definitely keep coming back....a special nod to keith and edwin who, if you are lucky and time it right, will drive you smoothly to your destination in the beautiful rolls-royce ghost :-) [provided it is within 1.5 miles!]. location is great for access to knightsbridge, belgravia, hyde park, mayfair and piccadilly.... if you like a good pint in a characterful pub, checkout the grenadier pub hidden in the lanes behind the hotel - it is like stepping back in time :-)'''",2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''for our weekend getaway in london, we chose mondrian london based on the ta reviews. what a terrific choice! the hotel is beautiful and conveniently-located. soho, covent garden, and st. james park are all within walking distance, especially if you enjoy long walks. the room is large and quiet with a very comfortable bed. the bathroom is luxurious with plenty of toiletries. we went to the hotel bar for a drink as well. although the view is great, it was very crowded. if you are willing to brave the cold, we recommend sitting in the bar terrace, which has a fantastic view of the thames and is not crowded. overall, we enjoyed our stay and recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we had a wonderful stay at the savoy for our first visit to london. the location is so convenient, i would hesitate to stay anywhere else. | check-in was quick and pleasant. as we arrived about 9 am, our room was not ready, but they took my cell phone number to contact us while we saw something of the city. they took care of our luggage and we were off. we received a call about noon from the front desk that our room was ready. | the gentleman who showed us to our room was very nice, asking about out plans and even made some suggestions. | our room was very nice, with a view of waterloo bridge. soft sheets, plenty of soft pillows..but the real highlight is the bathroom! at the end of our first day, we were tired and achey. well, the tub is big enough for two and filled so quickly, there is even a sign not to leave the room to avoid floods. with the provided bath salts, that tub really hit the spot. of course, i later fell in love with the rainshower fixture. i have to figure out how to get one at my house. | continental breakfast was included and it was always delightful to enjoy it in the riverview restaurant. once we saw how much it would have cost if it had not been included, we made sure not to miss it! the room is lovely and the service is great. if we wanted to upgrade to the full buffet, it would have been 5 pounds more per person, but we never thought that was necessary. we did need it delivered to out room one morning when we were taking the eurostar to paris for the day and needed to eat before the dining room was open. there was a 6 pound charge to deliver it to the room, but it was worth it. | another treat was the american bar. we met a wonderful server claire and a great bartender james. they helped us have a blast one night! | the doormen were always great, the room was always spotless and the concierge always answered every question. one even made a great suggestion where we could find a good curry! it was very good, by the way. oh, and we had a treat our first evening when they left a little cake in honor of my birthday, which we were celebrating on this trip! it was delicous. | what else can i say? an historic hotel, especially if you appreciate gilbert &amp; sullivan, with fantastic service! i would stay here again.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''i have stayed, dined and taken afternoon tea at the dorchester a number of times and can only heap praise on every aspect of this magical establishment. christmas high tea is a must, followed by cocktails in the bar followed by a barcelonan feast and a night of luxury in one of the sumptuous rooms or suites is an experience to be forever valued. | 10 out of 10'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''unaccountably this comparatively new well situated hotel had slipped beneath our radar, and we came across it by chance when looking for somewhere topflight for a weekend in london. having been shown a selection of rooms by an enthusiastic member of staff, we made a booking in person with the charming reception staff for a few weeks ahead. our stay was exceptional - friendly staff, from the doormen to the managers, all of whom seemed pleased to see and serve us. the large quiet room with walk in wardrobe etc was everything we could wish for. breakfast was one of the best we have ever had in london, both as to the choice of food and the organisation &amp; management of the restaurant.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''had the opportunity to stay here and although the room was smallish (though bigger than many city hotel rooms i have seen) everything was first class. the sleek room just felt luxe to it is core. the bathroom was generously sized with full tub, glassed in shower, nice size and height sink, heated floors and heated towel rack. truly comfortable bed and linens completed the package. requests were filled promptly by the friendly staff. ate breakfast here and every morsel was delicious. loved seeing a peek of the river while we dined. would have liked time to sit and have a drink at the american bar, but just did not have the time. also loved the location of this hotel.'''",2
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''a surprise birthday treat from my wife. parked the car outside the hotel to be warmly greeted by the highly professional staff. pre arranged valet parking and i handed over the keys. check in was done very quickly and we were shown to our room. i could not believe the quality of the service from the moment we entered this wonderful hotel. then, a visit from the butler who took away some items to be ironed (4 items included in the rate we paid). | it is location is knightsbridge, very close to hyde park corner and across the road from the park where we attended a stevie wonder concert (along with 65,000 other fans!). during our stay, i was impressed several times with how helpful the staff were to everyone. they used our surname on every occasion we spoke to them. | the room was beautifully furnished, very high quality fittings, great shower, superb bed and as clean as a room could possibly be. wifi was fast and free (ever had fast wifi anywhere? no? try the wellesley!). | the bar prices were very high (5 for a small coke and 8 for a bottle of beer) but hey, this is a very high end london hotel and to be honest, the prices did not surprise us. it is expensive to stay there but this was a special occasion, so we pushed the boat out - what the hell! | we could have had access to the hotel's beautiful rolls royce but only for a 1.5 mile trip (sadly we had dinner in the shard 3 miles away so jumped in a cab). | the staff are the best i have ever encountered in any hotel anywhere in the world and i have stayed in hundreds of them all over the place on business trips. | overall, expensive but you will pay more on park lane for good but not as good as the wellesley's service. clean, high quality room, superbly treated as a guest throughout our stay. | in leaving the concert in hyde park at 10pm we found our car waiting for us, bags in the boot and drove away incredibly impressed with our whole experience of this superb hotel.'''",2

The Savoy,"'''my husband and i have stayed at this lovely, grand dame flagship of the london scene twice now, and both times, it is among the very best hotels we have stayed at ever. we travel alot, and have been around the world more than once, and the savoy offers elegance, service, a warm welcome, accommodations and food that are almost unmatched anywhere else. this time, we paid a little more, and upgraded to an amazing junior suite, which was huge, and beautifully appointed. there was a claw-foot bathtub for me, a gorgeous walk-in shower for my husband, and a beautifully appointed suite, with a comfortable sitting area, and a giant, heavenly cloud like bed that we slept like babies in. the view overlooked a nice garden, and we spied the savoy tup, a privately owned, very lively pub, that we visited and would not have known about otherwise, where locals go for inexpensive drinks and fun after work (reviewed separately). the savoy is not cheap, so if you plan to stay here, leave the calculator at home, and just do it. you will not be sorry. luckily, our breakfast was included, up to 35 euros each, and that was a good thing. the breakfast is lovely and served either in their gorgeous conservatory, or, in the elegantly re-styled seafood restaurant. i recommend the crab benedict, which i ate almost every morning we are there. the crab was incredibly fresh and delicious, and i wish i had the recipe for their amazing hollandaise sauce! the service was prompt and warm, and we never felt like we were being patronized or ""talked down"" to. they respect all their guests equally, and from check-in, to asking for directions, to the restaurant service, even processing our laundry and dry cleaning, all the staff were professional, kind and helpful. do not hesitate to stay at the savoy, you will remember it forever!'''",2

The Savoy,"'''had a reasonable experience staying for a couple of nights in between christmas 2012 and new year. stayed in room 558 which is a one bedroom suite. | good points: | 1) the room size - but then you are paying for it.. | 2) luxury finish to the entire building. | 3) swimming pool. | could do better: | 1) sofa very hard and uncomfortable in living room. | 2) tv up very high on the wall in living room | 3) butler service bit of a gimmick * | 4) not overly child friendly. not allowed in bar areas. | 5) breakfast not included in room rate. its an extra 30pp per day | 6) tiny ""half"" bath. even in a larger suite. | 7) logistically difficult to get to from tube station with luggage. you will need a cab. | 8) swimming pool 1.2m in all directions so not for young kids. | 9) kids beds just basic camp beds. and crammed into the room. no thought design wise to room layouts when roll out beds are in there. just jammed in. | overall it was a pleasant (but not a wow) experience. probably if you come as a couple its great but with a 3yr old its not really suitable. | * butler service: you are informed on the website that you get your own ""personal butler"" but its not really true because its actually lots of different people (we had three) a guy called francies, then a lady in the morning then a younger guy the next evening. they bring you coffee and i paid 30 to have a shirt ironed but other than that they do not ""do"" anything really. i unpacked my own case. packed it myself. cleaned my own shoes. so i do not think they added anything to the experience. when i did call butler to book a restaurant i was told to call concierge. i am sure if you are spending big cash they are useful. maybe they were being discrete. and i am thinking i have not seen them!'''",2

45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''a la carte breakfast has never been my preference. limited with choices and can not just eat and go and then catch your plane or next appointment. when it comes to 45 park lane, it was no different. we had to spend easy 1 hour to order and finnish our breakfast. almost a time spent for a casual dinner. this was why probably there were only three tables at the restaurant. nobody bothered to wait such a long time. this was one of the main drawbacks of this hotel. | when it comes to rooms they were nicely decorated and quite nice. draw back here was even 65sq m2 rooms have no seperate divided living area. so you are all confined to one single large room. lowest one bedroom suit rates suddenly hikes to 2000 from 850-1000 for a junior suite. | concierge was perfect. service very good. but room and breakfast issue will make it difficult for me to choose this hotel again. | one last thing is free wi fi too slow.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''living just outside the m25 we have never had reason to stay in a top central london hotel. however as i was celebrating a significant birthday and we did not have time to have a proper holiday we decided to spend a couple of nights in london. after thorough research i decided the dorchester was the place for us. we were not disappointed. on arrival i was told we had been upgraded to a park suite, which was huge. the bedroom was comfortable, the bathroom very clean and well appointed. we also had a sitting room, complete with dining table. all was clean and well maintained. i had a good thai massage in the well-appointed spa. the front desk were friendly, efficient and remembered who we were - quite an achievement in a large, busy hotel. | slight niggles... the complimentary wifi was slow, and out of action for a few hours on our second evening. | the breakfast menu seemed overly complicated. the quality of the food was very good but service was slow as things were cooked to order. it would not be possible to have a quick breakfast before heading out. the banana smoothie was disappointing, whilst the orange juice was excellent. | the dorchester contributed to me having a really memorable birthday, the highlight of which was dinner in alain ducasse.

(i am only mentioning that part as we have just been in america and just spent another four weeks in europe- food service in most hotels is below average and most of our clothes get ruined when we send them to dry cleaners via our hotel). | it is always nice coming to stay at the bulgari at the end of our trips home knowing the service will be outstanding!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we stayed here for nye and nyd. as mentioned by others the location was fantastic for the fireworks, which is why we treated ourselves. it turned out that a friend of a friend was one of the concierge managers, which should in theory have been great for us.... however, he suggested we book for nye dinner but neither he nor anyone else told us the price - an eye watering 350 pounds! it was not until we had been in the restaurant for over half an hour that the menu was provided, which had the price shown. i was distinctly unimpressed and immediately complained. to the hotels great credit they did then agree to charge us only the a la-carte price for the items that we actually ate, which reduced the price by approximately 7 fold (wow!). however, we noticed one other large family suddenly ""disappeared"", having abandoned all their drinks so i do not think we were the only ones in the same boat, but perhaps they did not complain? the espa is beautiful, but they have very restrictive access and times for children under 16 (can only use the main pool for 3 hours per day, and nothing else is permitted). while i can understand the time restrictions, some of the other prohibitions are excessive, and indeed we saw many guests flouting their rules (including us!) until ordered out!! rooms are fantastic and my daughter certainly enjoyed the tv in the bath.'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed for one night on a saturday to celebrate our engagement. the staff were very attentive and even had a bottle of prosecco in our room waiting for us. they showed us around the hotel and were very happy to help us. we spent a few hours in the spa - the relaxation room is perfect to read a book and chill, which we did before dinner in the hotel restaurant. the meal was beautiful and service was excellent. the room was lovely and very comfortable despite not having a view over the river. highly recommend this hotel if you are going to spend this type of money. both bars were fabulous and still lively at 1am when we arrived back from our night out. the cocktails are great and the atmosphere even better!'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''i cannot afford the dorchester, period. but a very wealthy client of mine can, and did. i may have been one of the few non-oligarchs in the place, and had no bentley or rolls to park conspicuously out front. | the dorchester is perfect. and f perfect is what you seek, this is the spot. before i checked in, i ate in the lavish dining room, and left my jacket draped over a chair. yet when i checked into my room, there it was. how do they do that? | i laughed a lot at the dorchester, being one of the rare non-billionaires staying there. but i had a riot of a time. the rooms are exquisite, the meeting spaces first-rate, the food impeccable. you have to look past the snooty and over-privileged at this place, the crowd dripping with diamonds and fatigued by the world. but the staff are delightfully friendly, and the location cannot be beaten. step across the street and you are in hyde park. | will i stay there again? if another client steps up, yes.otherwise the dorchester will remain a delightful memory, a great london experience.'''",2

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''i cannot thank chris and his team enough for another amazing stay at the apex london wall. from the minute we arrived, welcomed like old friends, to the minute we left it is like a very lovely home from home with extras. we were down for the nfl again and as is typical of the customer service here we were made to feel special from the off, with huge smile from the young woman on reception when she realised it was the bruces back again and a nice card hoping our team would win in our usual gorgeous junior suite. | i really need to talk about the food this time. we are quiet and private and because i have me, we like to eat in our room, i love the room service menu, in my opinion it is even better than the restaurant menu as it has the healthy options and a good dose of comfort food too. having the lounge area in the junior suite helps this feel quite normal as we do not have to eat sitting on the bed. we had eggs benedict for breakfast every day that was just to die for, it is so easy to accidentally make it too vinegary but the chefs at the apex never ever make that mistake. and my husband just loves the club sandwich so much that he had it two nights in a row! i love the homemade burger in the brioche bun and although it is always too many calories for me to eat i always give it a blummin' good go, my mouth waters just thinking about it. | an extra special shout out this visit goes to that same lovely young lady who greeted us, who was seeing us off home when i told her that i was devastated that my husband seemed to have lost his wedding ring. we could not for the life of us find it. i so wish i had caught her name, they are always so personal with us and i wish i could return the favour...anyway she sprang into action calling housekeeping and then went up to the room herself to try and find it. we had spent 20 minutes turning the room upside down trying to find it and i do not know how but she found what we had missed and just as out taxi was pulling up, came running down with the missing ring. i asked if i could hug her because i do not think i have never been so relieved in my life, i may have hugged her a little too tightly! apart from the sentimental value of the ring it is unusual and not easy to replace. i she would a tear and then we had to dash off. | yet again chris's team did him proud, they take personal ownership of your happiness whilst you are there and that is priceless in my opinion. | if like us, you like somewhere quiet and caring to stay in london on the weekends, this hotel is absolutely it. see you next year my friends...'''",2

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''every single thing from check in, to a last minute booking at the rosebery tea rooms was just handled in a very professional manner. this was a special weekend as i was proposing to my partner. she had no idea and this little weekend at this amazing knightsbridge institution to grandeur and service was just super. the afternoon tea, the pool side and gym all just superb. the little touches - such as a small plate with the words 'would you marry me' just ensured my partner said 'si si si' and i pulled out the engagement ring and put it on her finger. the team at heston's dinner were spot on pouring each of us a complimentary glass of champagne, as well as giving us a tour of the kitchens and a signed copy of the al a carte menu. as well as presenting my other half with a bouquet of flowers (which i would pre-ordered). returning to our room the staff at put petals on the bed in the shape of a heart. it is these little touches that make the mandarin oriental just exceptional a really unique and special experience which i would say is probably one of the best in london. so if you are looking to do something special then do not hesitate. speak to jola / carla and suzy and make sure you brief them up because they will ensure you have an amazing time.'''",2

The Rembrandt,"'''nice hotel and friendly staff, but we were given a room looking out onto thurloe place which was very noisy all night! we had been doing a lot of walking so did not have a problem sleeping, but for light sleepers, the traffic noise would definately keep them awake. bathroom was freezing cold - no heating, so shower had to be turned on to heat the place up before hopping in! the food in the restaurant was good and reasonably priced, and the buffet breakfast had a good choice although perhaps a little slow in replenishing hot food, glasses etc. all in all, i would recommend this hotel and probably even stay there again on my next trip.'''",2

The Dorchester,"'''like many reviewers we were bucket list guests and stayed for a friends significant birthday. | i left with an overwhelmingly feeling that the staff were the best i have ever come across; nothing was too much trouble, everyone was friendly and all seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. even when the receptionist was unable to change our afternoon tea booking or give us a room with a view, she was so lovely about it that we did not even mind being told no. a really lovely touch was returning to our room after exploring what the hotel had to offer and finding a birthday cake and balloons had been delivered to our room. | obviously its a classy hotel, it is the dorchester after all, so the opulence was as expected. just a couple of minor things, and this really is nit-picking ....... being able to make a cup of tea in your room would have been nice as you do not always want room service and, in spite of it being a luxury hotel, unfortunately the sound proofing is not any better than your average budget hotel so we were duly entertained by the couple in the next door room making love at midnight! | we ate in alain ducasse ..... as i said before, it was a bucket list trip ..... the food was very nice and the service exceptional. but would i spend that much on a meal again? absolutely not. | overall the stay was a lovely experience and the staff really made it very special.'''",2

"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''along with a couple of friends we have enjoying high teas at 5 star london hotels for many years, and this was one of the best. there were a number of teas we had not come across before. sandwiches were fairly traditional but well made and plentiful; we were offered extra sandwiches twice. the scones and cakes were wonderful. service was first class; cups were changed, without having to ask, when we changed teas. plastic boxes were provided for uneaten cakes. the environment is very modern and very slick. for 2 people the seating and tables are of a normal height. for our group of 4 the table was low and seating, on a sort of l shaped sofa, was also low, which might not be convenient for everyone. we were on a special deal with a free glass of proseco making it a very good value tea.'''",2
The Dorchester,"'''what can you say about the dorchester grill experience. | everybody should eat here at least once in their lifetime! | from the moment of arrival, you are treated like royalty. | excellent food, service &amp; atmosphere! | prices.....i will not go there. go for the experience not the price!'''",2
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''the dorchester for the sophisticated young traveler. great stay, incredible brunch at the in house steak house cut. rhianna always stays at the pent house overviewing all hyde park. no where else to go.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''the savoy is such a warm and welcoming hotel! i have stayed here on a few occasions the most recent being outstanding! the service is truly one of a kind its such a classic and elegant hotel. | the breakfast is always how it should be in a luxury 5 star hotel and the staff are simply excellent. | i could never tire of visiting this hotel as the staff, decor and service are always impeccable. i am looking forward to my next visit to this charming hotel.'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''i brought my sister to london for a downton abbey birthday celebration. we decided to stay at the corinthia because i received a nice deal through american express. (i wanted to stay at the haymarket, but no deal available.) the hotel is truly lovely. the lobby is beautiful...filled with gorgeous flowers and the staff is very attentive and nice. our stay included breakfast and every morning it was a delicious treat. the hotel is close to everything...an easy walk to the london eye, to piccadilly circus, to trafalgar square to covent garden. i highly recommend the corinthia and will plan to stay there again when i return to london. (i also love the haymarket, so if there are good deals there, i would stay there again too!)'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''great location for theatres, local christmas markets and a wide range of good restaurants. lovely view to river, prompt and efficient service, and a breakfast with all we could want to start the day. | we hope to return every year!'''",2
The Savoy,"'''the ambience and location of iconic savoy, a historic masterpiece cannot be matched by other 5 star hotels mostly in mayfair. as if that is not enough, there is superb service, from bell captain to well trained hotel staff always ready to help. dean's superb concierge service and my personal bar tender michael in the american bar were truly exceptional. the well appointed suite with a view of london eye and the river thames rounded out the best hotel experience in london!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''stayed here for business and the staff were very friendly and helpful. room was excellent, very clean and tidy. restaurant menus looked expensive so did not get round to trying them out as on a budget. breakfast buffet was very good albeit a little pricey.'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''really enjoyed my stay here. i booked a junior suite that had enough space for my adult daughter and i to comfortably settle in. furnishings were very nice,bathroom big and the shower was great. the staff was friendly and eager to please. located near the moorgate (five minutes) and liverpool (ten minutes) tube stops, making it easy to get most anywhere, one downside: there is not much going on in the immediate vicinity of the hotel except some very busy pubs,and a couple of chain restaurants, but those all go dark on the weekends. however, you can walk about ten minutes to spitalfields market and there is more action around there - the walk back can seem a little lonely, though, if you are by yourself. overall, recommended.'''",2
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we have spent two nights with my wife in the hotel, celebrating our 5th anniversary. we have been upgraded to a junior suite with view on the hyde park. we have received a bottle of champagne as a gift from the hotel. we had an amazing dinner in the dinner by heston blumenthal. the afternoon tee was also perfect. my wife enjoyed a spa treatment and was very satisfied with the service. the staff was absolutely professional and very attentive. the hotel is undergoing renovation but our stay was not affected by the works.many thanks on the staff especially rosario, who supported as beyond expectations.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''i returned to the savoy for my second stay this year and if anything the experience was better than the first. this time i was able to enjoy the restaurants and spend a couple evenings in the thames foyer listening to an ella fitzgerald doppelgnger sipping cocktails. speaking of which, as an american, this is the one and only place in the uk i have been able to order a martini and consistently get what i ordered without having to provide instructions. i can say without reservation that the savoy is my favorite hotel anywhere. i will not stay anywhere else in london.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''this was a birthday present to myself, and it was worth every penny. the savoy is steeped in history. it felt like a trip back in time. the staff was welcoming without being obsequious, the room appointments were beautiful, and the location was perfect. i went to see a show at the national theatre and it was an easy walk over the waterloo bridge. i have started saving up for my next trip!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''just a one night stay, and i used hardly any facilities, but the things i did experience were practically perfect. love the superb design e.g. reception like the keel of a ship in dry dock. bedroom and bathroom very stylish with all necessary facilities including kettle. thoughful touches include perfectly adequate complimentary wifi (supercharged wifi is available at a supplement but i did not opt for it) and usb ports to charge your tech so that you do not necessarily need a uk mains power adapter. super rainfall shower with useful spray head too and luxurious cosmetics. and all this 6 minutes walk from the office! next time i will try the bars - because i am pretty sure there will be a next time!'''",2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''first class hotel everything so clean and modern. one gripe there was a stain on our bed sheet although the sheet was clean it did not, look good. the location of this hotel was excellent for where we planned to go aldwark theatre, hatton garden and clerkenwell.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''just returned from a hectic couple of days in london and have nothing but praise for our base there - the rembrandt. | sofia on reception was so helpful upon our arrival and departure that she deserves a special mention. | room was clean and well appointed , location was great , breakfast was throughly enjoyed and we would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''we stayed here for the first time for two nights as we had a party at the dorchester but could not get a room there we were not disappointed. i have never stayed in such a beautiful, elegant hotel. | we arrived by cab and were immediately made to feel welcome by the charming cockney door men... real london characters they are! we had a standard room but were given a lovely partial river view room (328) with a superb view of waterloo bridge, southbank and the thames. our room was in the edwardian part (there are two styles of rooms edwardian and art deco). the room has lovely quaint touches, like photo frames by the bed with some of the famous people who have stayed at the hotel. | we loved the stunning black and gold beaufort bar and every time we visited, the bar staff knew our names and drinks orderfabulous! the hotel, renovated at a cost of over 100m reopened in 2010 and has a very high quality, elegant design that feels both timeless but brand new throughout. | we thoroughly enjoyed the jazz singer in the beaufort bar who rounded off our saturday night beautifully. | we even treated ourselves to a ride in the savoy rolls (the one perma-parked outside the one with the reg s8 voy on it) to take us to the party at the dorchester everyone looked and we felt like film stars just fab and worth the 185 cost.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''the people who work at the savoy are the most cheerful, considerate and genuinely friendly crew. they are without doubt an important part of the savoy magic. | the hotel per say delivers everything you would expect and hope for from the savoy brand - an old and elegant hotel but bang up to date in my book. | great that the dress codes are relaxed to smart casual everywhere - so i could relax!'''",2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''we booked this hotel for a weekend away as it was my birthday. stayed in many hotels around the world for pleasure and work so we have high expectations. this hotel did not disappointment. 5mins walk from moorgate tube station and liverpool st, so easy access to london. | staff very friendly and professional, the hotel is also one of the cleanest i have stayed in. | definitely will be back and would also now consider other apex hotels having said that not sure i would change as this was great. | thanks for a great stay!'''",2
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''i love this hotel!!!! after staying there.. i feel more like family! everything was wonderful. and while i was not a fan of the cigar smoke that was a small, smelly low point among so many high points. | the property is wonderful! small, but the attention to detail is impeccable and everything is lovely. from the neutral colors and opulent furnishings in the room, to the marble, white and crystal fixtures in the bathroom. | what i cans speak of more highly is the staff. from the front desk, to the concierge to the helpers, drivers, front door!!!!!! everyone was marvelous. | it was truly the people that made our stay so wonderful'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we stayed at the rhodes hotel 195 sussex gardens, london w2 2rj during the first week of november 2005. the hotel is conveniently located in the paddington area of london and close to tube stops (2 blocks.) | the room was large, high-ceilings, and very clean. there was a working in- room television and coffee service plus private bath with unlimited hot water. the breakfast was very good. it was really an extended continental breakfast with toast, ham, cheese, yogurt, fruit and coffee/tea. an english breakfast was available for a small extra charge. the heating was good and the window opened for fresh air. | the owner/manager and front desk were extremely helpful giving us good advice on london travel and tourism. we were very pleased at the value for price and would definitely stay there again. | rick and louie'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''rhodes hotel feels like home after staying there many times in the past ( and two times this year). it is so convenient to paddington station and provides wonderful desk service for questions and directions. christos, the owner, is a genuine host and cares about improving his properties and keeping everything in good order. it is a pleasure to stay there!!!!'''",2
Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we have spent a nice long weekend at the corinthia. | we received room 120, which was not huge, but clean and modern. we loved the tv on the bathtub, the walk-in shower, mood lights and the warm floor in the bathroom. | the breakfast buffet is very big and has a great choice and high quality. the flower arrangements in the lobby are beautiful. | the spa is extended on a couples of floors and is very nice. the pool water is pleasantly warm. | and the staff is very kind. thanks for the lovely stay.'''",2
"Bulgari Hotel, London","'''the bulgari hotel and residence is in the heart of knightsbridge, within walking distance to harrod's, hyde park, mayfair. the rooms are very well appointed, thoughtfully laid out for the modern traveller (everything in its right place), with an amazing service and attention to detail. the atmosphere is elegant, and modern, the amenities top-shelf. the pool is 25 meters, wonderful for lane-swimming, rather than the usual hotel pools. this is even more remarkable given that the bulgari is on prime property. the gym is well equipped, which is necessary considering the quality of food. probably the top address currently in london, unless you fancy a classical 'british' atmosphere, and i would not given the quality of the hotel.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''my family recently spent two weeks in france where we had a truly wonderful time. we were having such an enjoyable time that we made a spur of the moment decision on our last day in france to extend our trip for a couple of days and take the train to london from degaulle. i am so happy we did! as this trip extension was impromptu, i did not have a hotel lined up for london. i hurriedly investigated, and knowing something of the history of the savoy, i made a reservation there. from the moment we arrived at the savoy in our london cab that had picked up up at san pancras, i knew that this was going to be special. i was able to upgrade our accommodation to a beautiful junior suite with a balcony and magnificent view of the thames, including st. paul's in the distance! the service in every area of the hotel was impeccable. we dined at their new restaurant, kasper, the first night and had a great meal. we also enjoyed cocktails several times at the amazing american bar, which echoed with all the royalty, showbusiness and otherwise, that have inhabited it. additionally, the concierge staff was really helpful in arranging outings for us, as we were completely ""winging"" this leg of our vacation. granted, it is high-end in every way, but we felt that it was entirely worth it! we are hoping to head back to london at christmas time and experience it at the savoy!'''",2
45 Park Lane - Dorchester Collection,"'''had a chance to stay in their suit on the 8th floor with stunning view across hyde park and the side views towards houses of parliament and london eye. | very stylish modern chic design, great service, very good restaurant and bar on site as well as the sister dorchester 15 steps away, and excellent location overall. | perhaps one minor thing - we could not play the radio from hotels ipad onto the lovely bang and olufsen tv and there did not seem to be an ipod dock or something of the kind. the rest is great, cannot fault anything really and the fact that the hotel is on the small side adds up to the luxury feel. the hotel is not cheap either.'''",2
Rhodes Hotel,"'''we stayed at the rhodes hotel for three nights during a cold spell in the beginning of october. our room, with a balcony and a jacuzzi, was small but very cozy. the room and bath were very clean, pleasantly decorated and even though we faced the street, there was no noise whatsoever. the room also had a small fridge, a small flat-screen tv with basic cable and amenities for making tea/coffee. the balcony was very cute and the geraniums well tended, in warmer weather it would have been well-used by us. outside our room there was a library nook and more reading material in the lobby. there is free internet access from a computer (heavily used, so we used it to confirm our flight in the middle of the night) near the breakfast room. the hotel is in a wonderful, though mostly residential neighborhood, a hop and a skip from beautiful hyde park and less than a 5 minute walk to 2 different underground lines. the proximity to paddington station is especially useful, as the heathrow express and connect trains come in through here. | one of the most positive traits about this small hotel is the constant presence of the owner, mr chrias, and it is obvious that he is deeply interested in keeping his guests happy and gladly offers tips when asked. his other staff members are just as accomodating, though perhaps less knowledgeable. on our last day in london, it started to rain heavily and the umbrella we had already purchased just did not cut it. when we mentioned that we were planning to take a stroll in the park, we were immediately offered one of the huge umbrellas in the lobby, there for the guests' use - little things like that can put a big smile on your face. | although not terribly cheap, the rhodes offers excellent value for the money (and come on, this is london) and there is no doubt we would stay here again.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''stayed here just for 1 night in april on a girlie trip to london. perfect location for the v and a museum, short walk from south ken tube, past loads of restaurants and cafes. | hotel has a great lounge area and bar and staff were great. | would stay here again as i love this part of town.'''",2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we stayed at the ridgemount hotel in london from christmas day until new year's eve. the hotel is run by a family and is more like a b&amp;b. though modest, it has a substantial seated english breakfast, and is near a couple of tube stops, etc. there is no elevator and the breakfast is in the basement. | however, the staff is very helpful, there is free internet service in the lobby, the ridgemount is very affordable, and the location makes for easy walking to the british museum (rosetta stone, elgin marbles, etc.), the british library (gutenberg bible, magna carta, shakespeare, beatles), the theatre district, kings cross train station (where you can take a photo of harry potter's platform 8 3/4), et al. plus there is a cafe nero around the corner, which makes great coffee and sandwiches. | this was our third trip to london with my family (husband, wife, two high school aged daughters). while we normally book our flight and hotel arrangements several months in advance, we found a great deal on a non-stop airfare and booked our plane tickets only one month prior to our arrival. this place was recommended to us by another hotel where we had stayed previously. while we have stayed at newer or more renovated establishments, this place worked for us given the circumstances. thanks for the recommendation! | bottom line: the ridgemount has helpful staff, is in a fantastic location for walking or tube access, offers a substantial english breakfast, and is very affordable.'''",2
The Rembrandt,"'''the location is south kensington is perfect. the rembrandt is in a fabulous area across the street from the victoria and albert museum. it is very close to the south kensington tube station; there are a multitude of restaurants nearby, harrods and hyde park are only a few blocks away. | we booked an executive double room and were upgraded to a club room upon check in. our room was spacious, clean, air conditioned, and very large by london standards. i was concerned that the room might be noisy because the property is at the junction of cromwell and brompton roads. however, our room overlooking cromwell rd had double-paned windows and there was no street noise to speak of. | breakfast is a serviceable buffet with a wide variety of choices. the staff is helpful. this is a large, very efficient hotel without much in the way of character.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''i have stayed at the savoy a couple of times in recent months. as usual the surroundings initially seem sumptuous but i am always left feeling a little let down. the bed was not at all comfortable last time and frankly the beautiful en-suite bathroom seemed larger than the bedroom. i am not quite sure why, when you are paying well over 400 for a night, you would expect a halfway decent sized bedroom. | the wine i ordered on room service was competent but again, quite overpriced even for the savoy, and most irritatingly, it took me quite a long time to check out. while i appreciate that there is something of a tradition here, there is no excuse for making someone wait 15 minutes during a very quiet time. | was not delighted, the food as usual was perfect, the stay sadly was not. now that i have moved to london i will not need to make use of these facilities again but i doubt i will be recommending it to anyone either.'''",2
The Savoy,"'''this was our fourth visit, third since the refurbishment. the savoy never fails us. the absolutely excellent staff in all areas are what this hotel is about as well as the superb furnishings. we were up graded and had a fantastic room. loved the new toiletries, used to be miller harris. but that is everywhere now. our meal in kaspers in the evening was lovely. we both left feeling very full. my sticky toffee pudding was just too tempting when i saw that on the menu, and i just had to have it. just cannot describe how lovely it was. had a great nights sleep. . . i always tell people it is like sleeping on a cloud at this hotel. everything about the savoy is first class. do not hesitate in coming here to stay, you will not be disappointed. . british hospitality at its finest.'''",2
