Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''although there is nothing wrong with theis hotel, i would suggest staying elsewhere. there are so many great hotels in the city, similarly priced. this hotel exists for people who want to be near their financial appointments. it is clean and the rooms are spacious, but it lacks character and the location is all wrong. service is a mixed bag and if there is a concierge i have never seen him or her in my 3 stays.'''",1,1
The Savoy,"'''so this was my first time staying at the savoy, and something i looked forward to for some time. in most respects, i was not disappointed. | first, the location is somewhat unique among it is peer group, more likely to be situated in mayfair. so the savoy's proximity to west end theatre and dining options is a plus, if that suits your interests, as it does mine. next, the public space is grand and serene, the staff is efficient and helpful, and the bars and restaurants are chic. | the rooms? luxurious, of course. not large, but sufficient in size. well appointed. however, a few quibbles. despite years of renovation within the past decade, the savoy decided not to meet the level of luxury in the bathrooms found at the connaught, as an example. the shower is barely more modern than the old hand-held wand approach. adequate, but out of date, and surprising to me in view of what the competition offers and how recently millions were spent on renovation. | ten bps a day for wireless internet service? at the prices charged by the savoy for a room, one would expect a bit more generosity. i guess they figure that at these prices, their guests do not care about another fifteen bucks a day. but free wireless would have been a nice gesture, in my view, and what i would expect from this property. | great, grand, historic, well-located hotel. good service. but this hotel plays in the big leagues, and, for the money, i think there are better choices.'''",2,1
The Dorchester,"'''everyone should have the opportunity to stay at such a lovely hotel. part of a collection of hotels, i have had the good fortune to stay at the beverly hills hotel, hotel belair, and 45 park lane but the dorchester is my absolute favorite. its a 5-star establishment on every level - environment/decor, location, restaurants and bars, but the very best thing about the dorchester is the people. i have travelled far and wide and have never stayed at such an exquisite hotel that also had the friendliest, most professional and helpful staff. my husband has stayed here 5-6 times/ year for the past few years on business and he will not stay anywhere else. they greet him by name on arrival. they have upgraded our room to a larger suite when they knew i was traveling with him. the bar managers greet him warmly when we stop in for a cocktail before dinner - they are truly happy to see him. it feels like you are part of an exclusive club yet anyone staying at the hotel is in the club. | all of the restaurants are fantastic. during our most recent stay we tried the champagne afternoon tea which was delightful but more food than we could possibly eat. at the end of our meal our waiter asked if we would like the leftovers sent to our room along with some mince pies. by the time signed the check and returned to our room, the box was there! | the clientele is very multi-cultural. the location is great for a peaceful walk through hyde park (across the street) as well as getting to heathrow quickly. i always get a kick out of the line up of luxury cars out front- g-wagons, bentleys, rolls royces, just an amazing site. | if you are interested in staying at a luxury hotel in london, do not hesitate to stay at the dorchester - or even just have s meal here- you will love it!! it is perfect, it will make you happy!!'''",2,2
Hartley Hotel,'''please do not stay in this hotel. in name of hotel prostitution business is happening in hotel. whole place is smelling like mad. if you like to visit prostitute then go. but they are also very dirty. this is actually not a hotel. for name sake they kept this name. | terrible place''',0,0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''first time stay here but sadly not impressed. | on the plus side we did have the river thames view (room 481) and the hotel was in a good location. on arrival we found the overall appearance dark especially the corridors,meals &amp; drinks were very expensive, so we dined close by instead. we did venture up to the rumpus roof top bar but could not even get a seat, very over crowded | would not return'''",1,1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''very disappointed. if your ever givenroom 101 do not leave reception before asking for a room move. the room was advertised as city views, what we could see was a vibrating plastic bush covering a ventilation system.no city view from the room we were moved to either.'''",0,0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''really impressively designed hotel, bar and facilities - stylishly attentive to detail in feel with a great set of staff to back it up. rooms are well designed and feel luxurious but not overpriced. great for a weekend in london.'''",2,2
The Savoy,"'''my husband and i do not mind spending money when it comes to treating our selves but on the occasion of my 50th birthday it was a complete disaster. as we never received an email confirmation for booking (was it made, i wonder?) from the simpson's in the strand restaurant, we did not have table ready and after waiting for around 40 minutes we left. the rest of the customer services varied from excellent (concierge) to very poor (restaurant and bars hosts, lower management). the property is exquisitely renovated but it is to be expected at this level. we have received a refund for the meal we ate at kaspar's where we set at the bar like any casual guests who popped in on a chance to be seated. i think it is fair to say that we will back to the dorchester where the standard of service match the surroundings.'''",0,0
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''girlfriend and i stayed 8 nights in february 2013. the strongest point of this hotel for us was the service. everyone was very well trained, so consistenly we got above average service. which is very nice because you feel welcomed and at home. | the second characteristic that stood out, during our stay, was the great location. shopping was next door, with harvey nichols in front and harrods five minutes walk away. location was very important because the cold weather in february is aggresive and you do not want to wander around too much ""looking"" for places. also, knightsbridge is considered the most exclusive and upscale area in town, meaning that you can always get out, and very closely, you will have a high concentration of the better restaurants, cafes, and ""posh"" things to do in town. | the food and the mandarin is also another great point to this hotel. bar boloud is owned by one of the top chefs of new york, daniel boloud and it is a great place to lunch, considering the quality. the other restaurant in the hotel is dinner by heston. another, great value really, considering it is the same chef of fat duck, among the top 10 restaurants in the world. | the weakest point is, with no doubt, the fact that the hotel facilities (except for the common areas) are run-down (guest rooms) and that if you are looking for a sleek, modern, (such as recently remodeled sofitels, for example) you will not find this here. the hotel decoration is very classy, a bit too much, but tolerable. be aware of the size of the rooms, it is no mistery that there is a strong corelation with high real-state value locations and smaller rooms, do not forget you are paying for being where the action is, so if space its important for you (we travel with 4 suitcases) make sure you check the sizes of the rooms, since is one of your selection criterion. we read comments of the sizes of the rooms, so we picked the second option in size and it went really well. we were on the atic on the nineth floor.'''",2,2
The Savoy,"'''my wife and i stayed here last week for one night and were upgraded to a suite on the fourth floor overlooking the thames. we had stayed here before when it had first re-opened in the frank sinatra suite and thought that was good but this was even better. | it was a superb experience and if i could afford 1,700.00 per night, i would, without doubt, stay here, in this room, every time i had to overnight in london! | so comfortable was the suite, we elected to stay in all night and enjoy the surroundings - we did, after all have an early flight the next morning. | room service dinner was excellent, as was breakfast, served by our own butler. | i could not fault the experience from check-in to check-out. | staff are polite and extremely helpful, room and fittings of the highest quality, beds extremely comfortable. | it was truly like staying in some rich person's house while they were away!! | surely the best hotel in london?'''",2,2
The Dorchester,"'''i have been to the dorchester many times, some of which were to eat at china tang and others were visits to the bar. on this occasion myself and a friend simply wanted to stop by for a cup of coffee in their lounge area at 9pm - they said we could but it would be 30 minimum spend per person. it was practically empty and they still wanted to enforce a minimum spend even though we only wanted coffee. we would just had a huge dinner nearby and only wanted a drink before we went home. we declined and went to the lanesborough down the road which is always welcoming and you can sit and have as little or as much as you want. i think it is a bit ridiculous to enforce a minimum spend like that especially as no other 5* hotels i have been to do this... (claridge's, the berkeley, the lanesborough, bulgari hotel, the ritz etc..) | will not consider the dorchester as a dining location again'''",0,1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed at the mo hyde park in london for business for a week in june 2007. the location is great (backs onto hyde park) and the service is on par. | however, i was very dissapointed with the following and as such will not stay in this property again. | 1. rooms - views on concrete walls in the basement for gpb400 per night are unacceptable; | 2. bathrooms - extremely dated, with no seperate shower. water pressure issues. dirty and unhygenic shower curtain (i travel extensively and do not think i have ever stayed in a 5 star hotel that has shower curtains); | 3. noise - the first room i was in was directly on top of the ballroom where they were having a 21st birthday party on a weeknight which lasted well past midnight with extremely loud music. the service staff indicated there was ""nothing they could do"" and apologised but were not able to offer another room. | in summary this property is extremely poor value for the price. i have stayed at the covent garden hotel (a firmdale property) previously and it (for only c.gpb250 per night) was far superior.'''",0,0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''on arrival the late middle aged owner and i had a disagreement over the deposit paid for by a colleague; we arrived before the colleague and the hotel owner exploded in a furious temper when i told him i was only staying one night; the colleague was staying two nights in a separate room; my companion and i in our own room. [the colleagues the owner, an older middle aged man, has a furious verbal temper and is what we call wha: a walking heart attack. best to have a cell (mobile) phone in case you have to call the medics for him. | the rooms: | almost every building on gower street over the length of at least three long blocks is a hotel so there is no shortage of other places to choose from if you want to sleep at a gower street hotel with traffic noise all night long. | at the ridgemount, expect to have a long night with no sleep. our room looked out on gower street, and even with the traffic dramatically lessened from the early february snowstorm, there were trucks and buses rumbling and clanging along all night long; around 4:00-5:00 a.m. a lot more traffic began going by; it was impossible to sleep. | breakfast: | the worst i have encountered at a b&amp;b or hotel in the uk. for cold cereal they use whole fat milk. (do not bother asking for non-fat or even skim milk). | toast is made with white bread; do not bother asking for multi-grain, whole wheat or anything healthy, there is no fresh fruit. | suggest go a few blocks away to the president hotel (also in the russell square district) where one can rent a clean, nicer room, no street traffic noise, and where they have a decent breakfast including fresh fruit, breads, pastries, croissants, hot and cold breakfast foods.'''",0,0
Rhodes Hotel,"'''the first impression was bad because the hotel gave us a room in the basement with no major facilities. then, we are transferred to a room on the 2nd floor but was not cleaned properly (dirty floor and dirty sheets) however during our stay the staff did all for our convenience. they are very attentive and friendly. but i do not advise this hotel. location is great, near paddington station.'''",1,0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we stayed at the mondrian for one night last saturday as a base for a theatre visit and the sales. what an excellent choice it was. we arrived long before the official check in time but our room was ready so our car was valet parked and our luggage was taken up to our room by a very charming concierge who like the rest of the staff was very helpful and cheerful. the beds are very comfy and the sleeping areas of the hotel quiet. we returned shortly before 11pm so had small dishes to eat in the den. these were excellent value and i can recommend them. breakfast was a little confusing as it was not properly explained and we had the full breakfast buffet and i only eat fruit and toast. having said that, it is not expensive if you make full use of the dishes on offer. the quirky nature of the hotel furnishings make a pleasant change from the staid offerings of other london hotels, as does the ability to walk straight out on to south bank. some of the views are stunning.'''",2,2
The Savoy,"'''we have recently dined in the savoy grill which was very average and i ended up sending my food back when it was not cooked properly but what i was more appalled by was the terrible service in the beaufort bar. the staff were rude and judgmental and i advise anybody not to use it, it is somewhere that we will never be visiting again'''",0,0
The Rembrandt,"'''the best thing about the rembrandt was the location. just around the corner from the south kensington tube station and a few blocks from harrod's. several good cafes are nearby too...we especially liked the creperie where main dish and dessert crepes are to die for! good shopping nearby too on brompton road. | the room was small and, as others have noted, the hotel is under renovation. we heard banging &amp; other noises from our room on the fifth floor but always after a decent time in the morning. the weather was warmer than the 60 degrees we expected and was more like 80 degrees and our room was not air-conditioned. open windows to traffic and a fan going made sleeping a challenge...not to mention showering in the heat. the room was clean and the bath was too. | the breakfast buffet was fine;plenty of choices and good. we did not eat lunch or dinner there opting for the local cafes. | would we stay there again? doubtful...but the location may bring us back. | staff was not super friendly...we arrived at 7am but absolutely could not check-in until 2pm even with several requests made. | staff got us a car to heathrow and told us it would be 30gbp...but the driver charged us 50gbp at the airport. beware. | we have stayed at hotels in london that were far more friendly than the rembrandt. if location and price are important then this hotel is fine.'''",1,1
The Savoy,"'''a simply great experience. service, expecially from the concierge guys was simply the best - and the decor and location made us feel that we got it right - and so did you !! it may feel a bit pricey but it was well worth it. | |'''",2,2
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''yes, this hotel is quite affordable. but having spent three sleepless nights at the ridgemount, i would recommend other holiday travelers go ahead and she will out another 50 for better lodgings where you might actually get a decent night's rest. after all, if you are spending several thousand dollars for your holiday, what is the sense of saving a few pounds to spend your days stumbling around london with every bone and muscle aching and your brain in a sleep-deprived haze? | if you insist on ignoring this advice to save a few pennies by staying at the ridgemount (note well, i did not write ""sleeping"" at the ridgemount), do not--under any circumstances--allow yourself to be placed in a room that faces the street. for three nights, we were mercilessly tortured in room 19, a ground floor en suite twin room with a window just a few feet from roaring traffic, traffic that hardly let us up until the hour or so just before dawn. (our industrial-strenght earplugs were inadequate to dampen the noise. we would have asked to be moved, but the hotel was fully booked.) | a night at the ridgemount on the narrow, short, and extremely hard beds with mopeds zooming past (at what seems like) inches from your head approximates the experience of sleeping on a london sidewalk, except that one must acknowledge the ridgemount was, to its credit, much cleaner than the sidewalk, scrupulously clean, in fact. | cleanliness and neighborhood location, though they do count for much, are the ridgemounts only unequivocally positive qualities. the facility itself lacks any suggestion of charm or grace, and the furnishings are uniformly old, cheap, worn, dowdy, crowded, uncomfortable--and very, very clean. | as for the breakfast, it was, by american standards and more so by london standards, unimpressive: frosted corn flake cereal (which i do not particularly care for), coffee, orange juice, one egg cooked sunny-side up, two slices of ham/bacon, white bread toast, rather good marmelade jam, and a lifeless vegetable. the only variation in the breakfast offering was the vegetable: half a grilled tomato the first day, canned beans the other days. the breakfast waitstaff, most of whom appeared to be eastern european immigrant girls in their late-teens and early twenties, were charmingly shy, prompt, quiet, and unobtrusive. indeed, our brief interactions with these young ladies were by far the most endearing aspect of our ridgemount experience. | the hotel desk staff were--for the most part--civil and responsive to our few inquiries, and the young man working mornings at the desk gave us accurate and helpful information about bus routes. however, a different young man at the desk the evening of the last night of our stay could not conceal his irritation when, as i explained that we had an early flight to rome the next day and would be pressed for time, i asked to settle our bill that night rather than waiting until the morning. he kept telling me i could do it in the morning. i kept explaining that we would be rushed in the morning, and would like to settle the bill now. he relented only when i stated flatly that i would pay the bill now and handed him my credit card. | i almost forgot to mention that, in response to my initial email inquiry for a twin room en suite, i was quoted a rate of 52 per night. but after i sent my credit card information to finalize the booking, the email confirming my booking for the requested accommodations quoted a higher rate of 68 per night. upon checking the information posted on the ridgemonts web site, i was able to see that the hotel had erred by initially quoting me the rate for a room without a bathroom, even though i had asked for a room with a private bath, so i did not complain about what seemed to be an honest mistake. however, at checkout i did not at all appreciate the surly hotel desk clerk's unsolicited and falsely hospitable offer to denominate the charge on my credit card in us dollars rather than british pounds. this sly trick, which inexperienced travelers fall for all the time, is known as ""dynamic currency conversion"" and creates a windfall profit for the merchant while substantially increasing the cost of the transaction for the customer, who will receive a highly unfavorable exchange rate from the merchant yet still pay whatever (and sometimes double) the ""foreign transaction fee"" that the credit card issuer normally adds to charges made in foreign countries. in my opinion, any hotel or merchant that presents the ""dynamic currency conversion"" option, without explaining its unfavorable consequences to the customer, does not care about the customers best interests.'''",0,0
The Dorchester,"'''after a busy family christmas we wanted a restful break at our favourite hotel. from the moment we handed the car over we switched into spoilt mode. i had made a gingerbread house for my grandchildren but i only wish they had been with us to view the dorchester showpiece. just sensational. | our suite was spacious with the most comfortable bed. the champagne and fruit was a lovely touch! | . | new years eve in the promenade lounge was perfect for us. i was a bit doubtful about eating outside of the grill on that evening but it really worked . great cocktails, a super 3 course meal served in style, dancing and more cocktails. there was a fun natural ambience with other guests and staff. eclectic yes and i felt very privileged to be part of it. | the grill is a work in process for me. we dined there on our second evening. the food was good and service is faultless but at the moment it just lacks that joie de vivre to bring it to life. maybe trying too hard but how can that be a fault. | i hope we will be back next year with the family. thank you to all the staff who looked after us so well.'''",2,2
The Rembrandt,'''we booked afternoon tea for 4. we were placed (in a virtually empty room) bang next to a staff meeting area. we had a wheelchair user with us so with some fuss moved away from the now screened off area (but the meeting was only inches away). tea was ok. bread for the sandwiches a bit dry and the 2 cakes unremarkable. standard fruit tart and a spicy carrot cake. tea did not arrive until we were 3/4 of the way through the feed. no refill offered - and it was too weak. no staff to call upon most of the time. a dull experience i probably would not repeat when there are so many good places for tea in central london.''',1,0
The Savoy,"'''first let me state that the service and people at the hotel is wonderful. friendly, responsive, everything you would hope for in a hotel. unfortunately, the hotel does not deliver the value you would expect from fairmount or any hotel at this price level. on two separate mornings, in two different rooms, i had not hot water. that is a crappy way to start a day. seriously, this is just not acceptable; motel 8 can give you hot water. | perhaps it is a london thing, but the bathroom seemed cramped. there was no separate shower and the bathtub had no curtain, only a half length plastic water guard along the side of the tub. hence, lots of water (cold) around the bathroom after the shower. | the breakfast restaurant was good, but also very expensive. and charging 10 pounds a day for wireless connection seems mercenary at this price point. overall great people, clean lovely hotel, but otherwise meh.'''",1,1
The Dorchester,"'''finishing up a multi-night stay at the legendary dorchester... | plusses | - great location | - class and $$ pervade at every corner (a fleet of luxury vehicles surrounds the front entrance) | - attendants at seemingly every turn wishing you a ""cheery"" good day | - room very nicely appointed with high quality furnishings (four phones?) | negatives | - some carpeting and other areas looking a little tired | - work out area highly outdated (small, cramped, no windows, but decent equipment) | - had breakfast, twice. english breakfast way overpriced at 34 pounds. on the second time, literally nothing ordered was brought correctly. couple next to us was to the moon with frustration on timeliness and quality of service. really quite amazing at how bad it was. it is breakfast for goodness sake, and at 34 pounds, at a place like the dorchester, it should be more than right.'''",1,1
Newham Hotel,"'''this hotel has the possibility to be excellent and 3 star except for the infestation of mice it appears to have currently (feb 2016), which is a real shame. stayed for 3 nights. staff friendly and helpful, cooked breakfast and buffet is help-yourself and beautifully cooked. could not fault the food. family rooms are a good size and bathrooms good, both have nice decor, clean beds/bedding, good mattresses and bathrooms clean and well appointed. | frankly the hotel decor is significantly let down by a diy approach to repairs and decorating e.g. nice wallpaper in rooms but poorly put up with cuts in the wrong places/patches and someone went crazy in the shower with a mastic gun! frankly this seriously detracts from nice fixture and fittings choices/room designs. room 20 had such a poorly fitted double glazed window the awful wind sounded like a demented owl who-wooing all one stormy night! kept us up most of the night. as i said, there was mice in room 20 and room 13, which they would moved us to! if you can ignore that, the hotel is on a main road around the corner from a tube station and on a bus route. mcdonalds almost opposite and plenty of shops/places to eat around locally. road can be a bit noisy but not exactly a country-side location so expected!'''",0,1

The Lanesborough,"'''i went with 2 other girlfriends. or | good - all of the staff were extremely friendly. especially my therapist alexandra. i left so relaxed and my skin was so enriched. | could improve on info prior to arrival like having breakfast and sauna before the treatments. | the waiting staff in the spa restaurant could improve on listening -we asked for hard boiled eggs and they came back soft. they also forgot to bring my tea. it was not busy so should not have got these wrong really. | after the treatments we went up to the bar and had a feast and tea. the staff there were lovely -luca, anna and tenik, see you all again soon.'''",2,2

The Lanesborough,"'''we booked a dairy free afternoon tea in this hotel, following the amazing reviews on the topic on both time out and the website of the hotel - to say we were disappointed with the offer, it is an understatement! we booked with more than two weeks in advance, and made it clear our dietary requirements. when we got there, a very polite waiter advised us he would check with the chef what the option were for the day - he never came back and after 10min a different waiter came to advise that we could only have the sandwiches and a fruit salad. clearly nothing was prepared in advance for our visit and we had to seat there watching others having this amazing choice of sweets while we ate what every lower than average restaurant offers for people with this type of allergy. the cherry on top of the cake was that we were charged exactly the same as the normal menu when we could not even eat it! this misleading advertisement should not be allowed for such a glamorous hotel.'''",0,0
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''the mondrian is a beautiful hotel and situated with a great view of the thames! loved the reception area and it is nod to shipping, although staff uniforms are somewhat familiar to a scene from star trek. the bedrooms were a stylish treat and the staff friendly and attentive.'''",2,2
Newham Hotel,'''we stayed here overnight whilst relocating our sons accommodation for university. booking in was easy and the receptionist was polite and friendly. the room was clean and comfortable except for the rock hard pillows. the bathroom however whilst clean had a broken thermostat on the shower and the shower plug was blocked and the tiles black and mouldy. there were good tea making facilities and the t.v had numerous channels. breakfast was buffet and help yourself with a reasonable selection and tasted good. would stay here again overnight but not for any longer.''',1,2
The Savoy,"'''we went to the savoy to enjoy afternoon tea in the thames foyer and were left disappointed. we arrived and had to wait to be seated for a minute or so, to be expected and nothing wrong with that. had a great table, thames foyer looks stunning and atmosphere is brilliant. however, after we sat down and the service begun, it went downhill from there. we go for afternoon tea at a different hotel every couple of weeks just to try out different things and this was the first time we heard the phrase no, we cannot do that. we always order one afternoon tea to share between us as we find it to be a lot of food; this has never been a problem, until the savoy. we really found it difficult to comprehend that this would pose such a problem. we spoke to another colleague, who was a little more helpful and said that in normal practise they do not do that but he would do it for us. then we received two of everything anyway. we just wanted one of everything to share, cannot be that difficult surely. it has to be said that after the whole thing we did half understand what they meant with this and we offered to pay for both but it was sort of forced as they were serving us as if we ordered two. on top of this we found the staff to lack a bit of communication and consistency. we were served tea, and then our cups refilled, great, but as an example one server filled our cups, and then literally less than one minute a different server came and filled (what they could) again. then at one point we had empty cups for at least 5 minutes. it has to be said that the food was great, as expected. unlike other hotels, they do not clear as you eat, we had dirty plates left on the stand for a long time. also the sugar bowl was so far in the corner that i could not reach it, as my partner was elsewhere she could not get it for me. found the staff not too smiley either, its amazing how much smiling staff makes a difference. even if they do not want to be at work, let us face it, who does, but at least they could pretend properly. male toilets very disproportionate, 14 or so urinals and 2 claustrophobic cubicles (sorry to talk about it but it is a bit dense). we then received the check without even asking, with no pen. we decided to go to the bar to try that out, transferred the check there and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. host at the bar was very friendly, and so were the rest of the staff in the bar to be fair, but just very slow. it must have taken at least 20 minutes to get our drinks. the people on the table next to us arrived 10 minutes later and received their drinks sooner that we did. cocktails were brilliant though. bar snacks were the worst we have experienced, felt stale and were boring. so we left liking the savoy product, but found ourselves not craving to return because of the staff. this is all based on afternoon tea and the beaufort bar, this is not to say that if we stayed there it would be the same. the problem is we do not really want to find out anymore. one word review: disappointing!'''",1,1
The Savoy,"'''like stepping back in time.....the savoy has a special charm. not everyone is cup of tea but i enjoyed every moment i stayed there. the beautiful fountain out from, the grand entry revolving doors, the polite and attentive staff, you will feel like you are being spoiled'''",2,2
The Lanesborough,"'''we stayed here for two nights recently. this was meant to be a part of a weekend birthday treat for my husband. from the time we arrived, our stay was stressful. firstly, our luggage did not make it up to the room. when we were shown to the room there was someone else's luggage in it. i questioned the young lady on whether this was our room and was assured that it was. the luggage was removed and i was told that ours would arrive shortly. we were due to go to the theatre so we were anxiously waiting for our luggage, but it did not arrive. i was forced to go back to the reception desk (as no one answered the phone) to enquire about our luggage. finally, the connection was made and our luggage was delivered to our room. i then requested that our garments be ironed quickly, as we were now in danger of being late for the show, only to be told by our butler that it would be quicker if we were to do it ourselves (given the distance he had to travel to iron the clothes). an iron and ironing board arrived pretty promptly, we ironed our clothes and left for the evening. not the start we had expected, but we were able to leave just in time. we arrived back at the hotel at around 10:30pm. i had booked a table in advance in the library bar. on arrival at the bar, we were made to wait as there were no tables available. and the manager of the bar gave us a table only after i would insisted that we had pre-booked. again, not the reception we had expected. breakfast the next morning was ok, but service was slow, even though the restaurant was not full. a refill of my cappuccino took a really long time, even though we were seated pretty close to where the staff station was. we opted for breakfast in our room the following morning and this was a more pleasant experience. this hotel mentions the fact that each room is assigned a butler. we telephoned our butler on more than one occasion, but received no response. we saw our butler once more, when he attempted to enter the room (while we were in it) to refresh the fruit. my husband and i failed to experience the charm i would hoped we would. instead, some of the time was spent stressing about things which should have occurred seamlessly - luggage, ironing, pre-booked reservations, just basic help. at check out, i was unable to secure a decent explanation for some of the charges on my bill, and left with a distinctly dissatisfied impression. personally, i do not think the lanesborough lives up to expectations. there are other hotels in london which would offer you a far better experience.'''",1,0

The Savoy,"'''having read several recent good reviews of the savoy, we are wondering if we stayed in the wrong hotel. | my husband and nine year old son and i decided to stay three nights whilst visiting the paralympic games and other various attractions london has to offer. | we arrived before arrival checking time and was greeted out of the taxi by the doorman. unfortnately, as we had arrived early they did ask our names, which in turn was repeated via ear piece to the lady waiting for us inside. our luggage was taken from us, no guided tour was given at the hotel as others have mentioned, just finger pointing on the spot to the various areas. | we were lead into the reception area to check in, as our room was not ready (we did not expect it to be) we said we would collect our paralympic tickets and have a look around london, no problem. we did receive a telephone call whilst out informing us that our room was ready. | upon arrival back to the hotel we were shown up to our room. the room as expected was in the traditional style art deco and lovely black and white bathroom. the view out of the window was facing other rooms, which we were fully aware of when we booked. our bed and pillows as previous comments were heaven. i had forgotten to pack my mobile phone charger and after a telephone call to reception they kindly collected my phone and charged it for me. | however, after this the service we felt went down hill. after returning late to our room the first night, my son mentioned that the mattress was hurting him. after checking this myself i noted that you could feel the mattress springs through the material, it was awful. we made a more comfortable bed for him on the floor and contacted reception the next morning. as they quite rightly pointed out to me, i should of contacted them that evening and not waited until the next morning. i had to agree, that was my fault, after all that is the service you pay for. they said they would bring a replacement mattress and was apologetic. when we arrived back to the room they had changed the mattress and left a voice mail message asking if we were happy with the replacement, i acknowledged this. | however, my husband and i did expect perhaps a little something complementary for my son in the room for the trouble caused. maybe our expectations of this hotel were too high. | we did not eat in the hotel as all three days we have planned events so we had breakfast en route to the events rather than rushing eating the breakfast at the savoy. we had made various bookings for dinner, including the ivy. the one thing we noted was the lack of tea &amp; coffee facilities in the room, just the mini bar and the complementary water on the second night when housekeeping carried out the turn down service, and the complementary morning newspaper. wifi was 10.00 for 24 hours unless a member. | our last day we had housekeeping knock on our door at 8.45am to ask what time we where leaving. we have showered and dressed and had an event booked for that morning so we thought we would check out before the 12pm deadline leaving our luggage at the hotel until our train departed that evening. whether it was to liase back for luggage collection we are not sure. we said we where leaving in half an hour but, no one came to collect the luggage, so we presumed it was housekeeping that wanted to know when to come back to clean the room. | when we arrived back later that afternoon the hotel was very busy with people arriving for afternoon tea. we decided that it would be nice to have a cup of tea and a piece of cake from the savoy tea shop and relax and watch the world go by for an hour or so. we asked the lady if it was possible to have a piece of cake and tea at the empty tables dotted around the foyer, she went off to ask someone and came back and said no it was not possible. | we felt so uncomfortable at the point we collected our luggage and left. we are not people that expect fuss, however, we felt the service was very unwelcoming, perhaps it would of been different if we have stayed longer or booked one of the superior rooms. | we have stayed in many superior hotels, i myself at the waldorf astoria in new york and the service was impeccable. we have also stayed in three star hotels en route to our holiday destinations and we have never been made to feel as we did at the savoy. | the hotel is full of history, and beautiful, but, we shall remember the savoy for the wrong reasons.'''",1,1

Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''went for two nights at a short stop in london. staff was very professional and friendly, went out of their way to find a room with our extra request and offered us a free drink at the bar for a ten minute wait till the room was ready. bags were brought to our room at the same time. clean rooms, and some complimentary items. one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in, and will definitely go back for our next visit to london. the hotel restaurant was also decent for a hotel.'''",2,2
Apex London Wall Hotel,"'''it is ratings like this that gives tripadvisor a bad name. i stayed a night here and it was perfectly ok for what it is. staff were perfectly nice and i got an upgrade from my 160 double room. but there was nothing to distinguish this from any one of numerous central london modern-ish 4 star hotels i stay in on a regular basis. it was a touch above the kwest, for example, but only because the kwest needs a bit of an overhaul, but still is 50 a night cheaper and is arguably in a nicer part of town. but what kills the apex is the lack of any parking at all - not even a decent guests' rate with the local ncp - ten minutes' walk away. to rate it in the top 25 in the uk is a bad joke.'''",1,1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''this is my second stay at the mondrian sea containers in the past 10 days, and my third in the past month. this hotel has the components to be great, and it is stylish by almost all london standards, but it falls short from what it could be. some staff members, such as aries at the front desk, are truly impressive. others just deliver a snobbish lack luster performance, which is disappointing and yet important when you are trying to encourage your guest and staff to be ""show ready"" at all times. it is fine to have a hotel that wants to be hip and cool (such as is very well achieved by the mondrian los angeles, the w hong kong, and a host of other 5 star properties globally) but not at the risk of customer service, and definitely not at the risk of making guests feel unwelcomed or that they do not fit in. comfortable beds, clean rooms, great toiletries, and phenomenal river views (if you get one - otherwise you are looking at someone in the building next to you sitting at his desk looking back at you or over looking and listening to the horrendous noise from the construction site and in the building). | if you represent the over 35 crowd with money and influence and travel experience on a global scale (as i do), enjoy the hotel - just try not to be seen as this hotel is unfortunately not mature enough yet to embrace those who may not be ""pretty young things"" and yet drive global trends in business. | their loss.'''",1,1

The Savoy,"'''i really really wanted to come back from taking my mother to the savoy for afternoon tea to celebrate her 50th birthday on 29/4/13 and write a glowing review. really, i did. sadly, this is not the case. although it was a very special experience, it would put me off staying there (if i could ever afford it!) let alone eating there again. | it all started with the arrival. the doormen were busy taking something in through a side door, and did not even notice our arrival. no greeting, no opening the door for us, nothing. then when we arrived in the lobby, we were just stood there not knowing what to do. nobody came over to offer us any assistance, even though there must have been 10 members of staff in the lobby. bitterly disappointing first impression. | we were sat down and had the menus explained to us, and they were already aware of my mother's diabetes (i had mentioned this in my booking form and in the confirmation phone call a few days beforehand) so all was good there. however, they knew the time of our arrival, but the sugar free scones for my mother were still baking in the oven, as a result she received hers long after i had received mine. it was the same with the pastries. i would have thought our food would have come at the same time to allow us to enjoy it together. | our waitress also left us on several occasions to go and talk to her mother in the bar, which i thought was rather rude to be quite honest. | so, although the food was very good, i found the service took the gloss off the whole experience.'''",1,0

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''look elsewhere for a hotel there are many great ones in london and this is no longer one of them. this hotel is pretty shocking for the price and was definitely not up to the standard you expect from the mandarin group. the atmosphere although friendly is pretty complacent. our room was stuffy airless and smelt smoky. the hotel charges 6 an hour for the internet. say no more. the bathroom had been partly refurbished, but the enamel on our bath was peeling and the bath generally looked dirty and in need of re-enamelling. the shower screen had lost its silicone edging so the shower water flooded the bathroom floor. our duvet cover had holes in it (yes this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel), and the aircon was noisy. on the plus side the carpet was smart, but overall the room felt tired and in dire need of refurbishment. to cap it all at breakfast my partner had the smoked haddock which smelt very strongly when it arrived. the portion was large and there were two pieces of fish, one of which was all right the other tasted and smelt poor, and was not eaten. when the waitress asked if all was ok with our meal we mentioned the fish, and were told 'do not worry all our fish is smelly!'. she checked with the kitchen who merely said both pieces of fish came from the same box. no apology. no offer of an alternative, or even an offer not to charge for the inedible fish. by this stage we were pretty fed up with breakfast anyway (how can they charge 7 for a single crumpet!!) and it did not add to our joyless overall experience. my advice? stay at the connaught, claridges or browns where the guest still comes first and none of the above occurs.'''",1,0

The Savoy,"'''exception service is first thing that comes to mind! a level above most other 5 star hotels even in london. a manager emailed me the day before my check in date asking for my arrival information and any special requests and all have been accomodated. you get a personal message from the manafer, not an automated form to fill out. as other reviewers noted the minute you walk into the looby you are greated by a greater/host and are taken straight to your room, no usual reception check-in experience. i appreciated that personal element. what still puzzles me the most is how they knew my name ( i have not been asked by the hostess, instead she greated me by the name and took me straight to my room). the porter must have glansed at my luggage tag during that thos few second that he was helping me with luggage at the cab. whichever way, it was impressive. within 15 minutes from arriving at the hotel i had tea sent to my room, massage and dinner in a sought after soho restaurant booked. the decor and style might be fussy (but that is a matter of taste), bubt is otherwise a very beautiful property. one of those where you do not even feel it is approproate to discuss cleaness of facilities, etc. it is just perfect. ro0ms are not huge (my executive room was standard in size) but beaituful. it is big and layout is a bit confusing, but i assume they had to work with a historic property when renovating it recently. room service was fast (when you order they give you exact time when the food will arrive) and for hotel room service food exceptional (middle eastern mezze were on par with best ny restaurants). wi-fi is not free unless you a member of fairmont presidents club. i mentioned to my hostess that i do not know my membership number, so she must have looked it up herslf and as no internet charges appeared on the bill.'''",2,1

anyway, he drove us to the savoy advising that there is only one way to enter the savoy in order to get the full effect. to be honest, i had not really thought about that but as the savoy is set back from the strand in its own little private road it made sense you cannot really get the full wow factor of the incredible art deco entrance unless you enter head on from the small street straight across the stand and i never thought i would say this, but we were lucky enough to get stopped at the traffic lights - giving us time to take in the amazing sight of the savoy entrance. the savoy, with its glittering statue of peter of savoy in all his glory standing atop the roll royce frontage surrounded by fluttering flags is a sight to behold, truly iconic in every sense of the word a hotel with an unparalleled history, amazing tales of the rich and famous (and maybe, the not so rich and famous) that must have been played out over the years in this one small part of london the stories it could tell! | we arrived a little while before 3pm (official check in time) and were immediately assisted by the very welcoming and beautifully attired staff at the main entrance - helping mum from the taxi, organising our overnight bags and escorting us into what i think must be the most beautiful hotel foyer in the world - less than 3 minutes at the savoy and mum felt like a duchess. | my first impression. was simply wow. mums whispered first comment to the concierge as he help her from the taxi was i have waited over 50 years for this! this wonderful person smiled and quietly whispered back it does not matter how long it takes you to come back were here waiting for you! i could have cried- what a wonderful thing to say. | the rich, dark wood, original revolving doors, gleaming black and white floors, sumptuous rugs and sofas surrounded by stunning bronzes and beautiful porcelain wall friezes at ceiling height- the more you look the more you see. in fact, everywhere there is something else to drag you into a world that i now know, can only be the savoy. | we were introduced by the concierge to the lovely reception staff, shown to a grand and exquisitely decorated reservation /check-in area, where we invited to have a seat and complete our check-in process. we were being escorted to our reserved twin room when our angel of the savoy appeared and introduced herself we finally meet the lovely person who had been so instrumental in ensuring that the trip could go ahead as planned. i already knew she was extraordinarily helpful but she is also incredibly beautiful and such a lovely lady to talk with she insisted on personally accompanying us to our room, which i thought was such a lovely touch and arriving at the 7th floor, we were met with a beautifully understated but elegant corridor leading to room 754. the door opened and we were completely blown away. | our expected little twin room was, in fact the most beautiful edwardian suite with views over the thames. i have never seen a more stunning hotel suite. the angel had upgraded us to this incredible suite. the same black and white chequered tiles floor as the main foyer welcomed us into a large and out of this world entrance hall, which had a lovely modern twist due to the gorgeous lilac textured walls. a beautifully proportioned sitting room was decorated in a classical edwardian style - comfortable cream sofas, elegant high-backed pale green chairs, dark wood desks and cabinets throughout. simply wonderful. the bedroom was decorated in the same style and again - just breath taking. we were so shocked and completely over the moon- not believing this was ours. we were so in awe of our lovely surroundings - it took quite a few minutes to noticed all the other little extras that debra had arranged a beautiful little birthday cake and card, champagne, chocolates and a delightful bag of the savoys special blend tea. we had been in the hotel less than 15 minutes.and mum, who felt like a duchess before, now felt like a princess our angel gave mum a theatre programme and advised that she has also arranged special access and a dedicated member of theatre staff to assist us. | can a day get any better? | well actually, yes it can and it did. | i had a table booked for mum to enjoy the savoys legendary afternoon teaso after freshening up, changing clothes and enjoying a glass of champagne in our beautiful suite we headed down to the restaurant. this is got to be one of my favourite places in the savoyelegant, beautiful and serene! there really are not enough words to describe how truly lovely it is. | the famous savoy afternoon tea is everything it is reputed to be and so, so much more.the selection of teas is second to none - mum fell instantly in love with the savoys specially blended black vanilla (telling anyone who will listen that this is the best tea in the world!) the selection of finger sandwiches would be hard to beat, but you just must try the smoked salmon with lemon curd cream cheese. odd sounding, yes, i thought so too - but it works on every conceivable taste level possible and the warm fresh baked scones served with clotted cream and fresh strawberry jam were feather light and mouth-watering but the little fancies and cakes were beyond description.little works of art in their own right . the lovely maitred visited every table, offering guests a complimentary glass of champagne, which you could see was very much appreciated and enjoyed, just a little touch but it just helps provide an overview of the incredible standard of customer care and service that the savoy and its fabulous staff provides to each and every guest. the lovely pianist, who added immensely to the overall ambience, even played a few bars of happy birthday for mum, while the staff presented her with another delicious little birthday cake to enjoy. in fact, we could not finish even half the cakes, so our lovely waitress from italy, arranged for them to be boxed up and taken back to our suite for later. (sorry, but you have no idea how much i love writing our suite instead of our room!) | we were just 4 hours into our stay. | after our delicious savoy afternoon tea we decided to have a little breather, return to our suite to relax before going to see dreamgirls. we both just sat looking out the window, relishing in the fabulous view of the city and the thames until, all of a sudden, it was show time. on leaving the hotel we walked about 10 metres to the theatre door and we were met 3 lovely staff and advised by a darling young chap that he would be our assistance for the whole evening, that if we needed anything just let him know. he took us into the small but incredibly beautiful savoy theatre . pointing out the seats that had been specifically reserved for us but also advising that if we felt that they were not suitable then he had other options available. but like everything the savoy does the seats booked were perfect. i do not think there were better seats in the house front row, circle. we were very lucky, not only did we have the fabulous seats, but we ended up chatting with 2 lovely young men sitting next to us, who were so funny, interesting and well acquainted with scotland. they often stay with friends who live not far from usanother amazing coincidence in a city this size! | the show was not what we expected but all the better for that very reason. especially in this stunning and intimate theatre. the acoustics are fabulous, the costumes- dazzling and the story was sad/funny and enthralling all in equal measure. at the end of the show, we were escorted back the main entrance of the hotel where we were welcomed home, asked about our evening etc we felt like everyone was a friend, staff addressed us by name and seem genuinely interested in every single guest. in glasgow, our city motto is people make glasgow . well, this truly applies to the savoy. yes, the hotel is stunningly beautiful, the service is out-standing and the savoy even surpasses its own world famous reputation on every level but the people are the real stars. they truly make you feel like you are the most important guest in the hotel. (and mum, who felt like a princess before had by this point decided she now felt like a queen!) | debra had booked a table for us at the world famous american bar but it had been such a long but wonderful day that mum was exhausted so i felt it was best to take her back upstairs rather than stay and enjoy a cocktail (much to my disappointment) but it was mums birthday treat and she was tired soheyho! mum was straight into bed and asleep in minutes, so i decided to make the most of the massive, luxurious bath and have a soak using the wonderful decadent toiletries - such bliss and so relaxing after our hectic and fabulous day. | and so to bed! into the most wonderful bed i have ever slept in (i never thought any bed could compare to those at the hong kong penninsula, boy, was i wrong. savoy beds feel like you are sleeping on air, they just wrap themselves around you and feel heavenly. in fact, i think it would be nearly impossible not to have a great nights sleep. | next morning myself and the queen made our way down for breakfast. the breakfast menu at kaspers is excellent and a really great way to start the day.. from the aroma of vanilla wafting from the little trays of pastries, to the scent of crushed blueberries in the fresh baked muffins that are offered while you make your breakfast choice right through to the delicious savoy breakfast that we opted for and wonderful rich and aromatic coffee served- there was not a fault to be found. but after our delicious and very leisurely breakfast, we had to head back upstairs to pack and contemplate the journey back to reality. our wonderful stay was nearly at an end and honestly it really was truly, truly wonderful. | in reality, visitors come to london to see the sights (and rightly so, it an amazing, complex and vibrant city) but people stay at savoy to make memories. yes, the savoy maybe a little expensive but it really is worth every single penny. it might be a world-renowned 5* hotel but its much, much moreits a feeling and it just makes people happy. i now totally get the savoy | on the way back home to scotland, mum turned to me and said that she felt dad was with her during our stay, that it might have taken over 50 years to revisit but if she died tomorrow she would die happy. | this gorgeous, charismatic hotel with incredible staff creates memories and experiences that will last a life time!'''",2,2

"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''stayed there for two nights and was very much looking forward to it. my special conference rate was high, even for london standards. on the plus side was the service, not to be faulted other than very noisy cleaning ladies in the hallway at 7 am. on the negative side was the state of the room and the hotel generally. it is just a bit run down, not fresh. as an example, the bathroom was old, small and not very clean. the shower - in the bath - had mildew. the smoke detector had not been cleaned for clearly a very long time. small things, but for this hotel group i would think not acceptable given the rates.'''",1,0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,'''the hotel was spectacular and all the facilities were of an excellent standard but it is the little things that make it extra memorable and sadly these were lacking and we were turned away from the bar as apparently you had to book a table yes even in a cocktail bar and even when we had booked four bedrooms for the weekend. probably it was mentioned in the fine print but mondrian you blew it and not only that but we were made to feel very uncomfortable...''',1,1

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''having dined in the mondrian a couple of times, my partner and i decided to spend a night at the hotel to celebrate my 30th birthday. given the occasion, we requested a room with a view when we made the booking. while checking in, we were promised by the receptionist a room on the highest available floor with a view of the city and the london eye. | however upon entering the room, we found the only view on offer was an office block within 5-10m away with windows directly facing the hotel (see attached photo). the room was severely overlooked, and we had to keep the curtains shut at all times. we appreciate we did not book a superior room so we were not expecting a river view, but this view, or more accurately, this 'non-view' was far from being acceptable. | the room itself is tastefully decorated by drs/tom dixon, but it is small - okay only really for a single traveler or a couple staying for a night or two. the air-conditioning is very dry and rather uncomfortable. there is also no dressing gown or nespresso machine in the room, something you would expect in a 5-star hotel. on the plus side, the toiletries are fantastic - from malin + goetz, same with other hotels in the mondrian chain. | during our stay, we also checked out the gym and the spa in the basement. gym was well-equipped and quiet, which was a bonus. spa &amp; steam room was also decent - stylish and well-maintained. we did not get to visit the rooftop bar, the rumpus room, as it only opens between tue &amp; saturday, so we headed to the cocktail bar, the dandelyan, on the g/f instead. decor of the bar is trendy but elegant and classy. the cocktails were also delicious. | overall, we found the amenities - bar, restaurant, spa - of the hotel superb, but the rooms and the views (from the standard rooms) disappointing. service was professional and attentive, however we cannot help but feeling miffed about the fact we were misled by the receptionist that we were given a room with a good view.'''",1,1
The Savoy,"'''whenever i am in london, i stay at the savoy. after it was reopened following its refurbishment, i have stayed in several of the rooms, including a recent stay where i stayed in a personality suite on the 4th floor with river view. | the room was delightfully airy and spacious. the view is quite incredible. the little touches are what makes this hotel marvellous however. the 24 hour attentive butler service, whom never hover waiting for a tip when they have served you. the fact that i usually travel with my celiac partner and yet they can make all foods to her liking, and she never suffers an allergic reaction. the hot room service, the first class fitness suite and 3rd floor pool with top atrium. i recently travelled with a type 1 diabetic, whom they modified the menu for, and even served his food in the beaufort bar which they would not usually allow - but they never say no here and they will go far beyond expectations. | the others in my party stayed in a junior suite which was very nice. lovely bath with walk in shower, and spacious. the hotel staff are all trained to perfection, and are polite and friendly in any circumstances. booking a vehicle to take you to a specific destination (we had a function to attend) was done with similar ease. taxi's are immediately available out front, and there is always a taxi regardless of the time of day/night. | put together the level of service, the hotel rooms, the genuine care put into every stay, the location and the ease of the whole experience, and you would never want to stay anywhere else again. when in central london, i never stay anywhere else! | just a word of thought for the hotel - the rooms are expensive to purchase outright. as such, i always purchase a cheaper room, then take advantage of the often 1/3 of the price 'standby' upgrade system. i always get the room i upgrade to unless it is around a special event or time of year in london. makes me wonder why they bother putting the rooms on so expensive, because it deters people from purchasing them, before giving them all away at half the price as no-one has purchased them! just seems a bit of an odd way of doing things (it was not like this when the hotel re-opened, but lately that seems the way things work!) | so, an amazing hotel indeed. simply the best in london, the most central, and a lot less 'chintzy' than the ritz, which is outdated now and not close enough to central london. congratulations to all the staff on winning second prize in the best cocktail bar competition also - the american bar is a thing of beauty!'''",2,2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i planned to stay here with my partner and some | friends as part of a birthday surprise weekend. i mentioned this to the staff prior to arriving and asked if we could have a room with a nice view and if we could have our rooms on the same floor atleast. on the phone i was told this would be ok but when we got there the availability must have filled up? because this was not the case. i also asked about special birthday options but was not told anything would be possible? anyway, the decor in this place is beautiful and the location is perfect. the rooms themselves are decent sized considering most hotels in london have very small rooms. it was a really lovely experience to stay in a beautifully decorated hotel. it was easy for us to get to and get back to after a night out. you can enjoy a wide array of breakfast options in their restaurant with a nice view of the river and the complimentary late check out option is brilliant and i wish other hotels would follow suit. the service was on and off but mostly the staff were nice and polite. we wanted to try to rumpus room bar but was told mixed things about whether we could or not? some people said we could before a certain time and some people said we could not because there was a wedding party. we chose not to check it out in the end. i cannot mention how beautiful the decor is though and the beautiful mix of guests and customers who float around in bright clothes or families in suites really reminded me that this is what london is about, culture, art and fun. i would not rush to stay here again but would deffo consider it. not for a special occasion again though.'''",1,1

Rhodes Hotel,'''i booked the hotel to stay overnight for a big exam. reached the hotel around 10 pm. and was walked around by the very friendly night manager to my room which was in another building closeby. first thoughts when he led me up 4 flights of narrrow stairs was oh my god!!!! | he opened the door to a small room which was boiling. the bed was a double bed and there was a tv. the toilet and shower were ensuite. | i however noticed that the room and utilities were exceptionally clean and the blue led lights in the shower (which was very powerful and refreshing) were a nice touch. the bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning soon cooled the room down and maintained a very comfortable temperature throughout the night for a very restful sleep. the tea making facilities were very good and the room had a small refrigerator as well. also the night manager brought me an iron and an ironing board in the morning within 10 mins of asking. for the price i was paying in central london i could not ask for more as the breakfast was also included which i did not have as you can guess because of the butterflies in my stomach before a big exam.''',2,2

(so dbl bed took up five feet, leaving only 3 feet of space, which also had to hold our suitcases.) noise from street was loud, but then this is london, and that is what you need to expect. | breakfast was an extra flight of stairs in to the basement, also very narrow. | place is very clean! so even if the carpet might be torn in places, and the narrow stairs tilted a little, they were all immaculate. sheets of a nice quality. | breakfast served by a couple who were older and english, supported by a team of younger people who seemed polish. service was good, except for the english tend to still cover their mouth with their hands when they sneeze, and then they pick up your plate and hand it to you, with the same hand they used to cover their mouth. they need to be taught to sneeze in to their arm, and not to use hands as kleenexes. breakfast was a full english breakfast every day, and was included, when some hotels charge extra for anything beyond toast. breakfast food seemed to be re-heated, and not always cooked fresh. | i would reccomend this hotel for a person who does not want to stay in a hostel, but can not afford a nicer hotel. would be excellent for a group on a school trip, and assign the teachers and chaperones the rooms that are en suite, and allow the kids to use the rooms with shared hallway facilities.'''",1,1

The Savoy,"'''stayed in early november, and it was lovely. we were in a suite and the room, decor and view was beautiful. bathroom was large and the room was spottless. the staff was very kind and made us feel very welcome. as this is old world elegance and service, i was happy to see the staff was not stuffy, but very accomodating and relaxed- yet formal enough. a nice balance to experience in a five-star hotel. the american bar was true history, and the staff in the bar took great care of us, and explained the drinks, which was a lot of fun. my only ""complaint"" was the overall value- for the price of the room, though the stay was wonderful- it would have been nice to have included breakfast- even something minimal or some other small amenity. when you are paying so much for a room, those little extras go a long way. however, this is very common in many high end/luxury resorts, so i cannot hold it against the savoy. overall a great stay, and wonderful experience in london.'''",2,2

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i booked rooms for myself and a group of friends to stay and celebrate my 50th birthday. | i was told that my room had been upgraded and while i did shower, it was not until day 2 that i sat in the most uncomfortable bath i have ever bathed in. it was a wheelchair accessible bath and as well as being very shallow, reclining in any comfort is impossible. if you are in a chair and have any paralysis anywhere down your spine, be aware that the top lip of stone causes a single, painful pressure point that is potentially dangerous and now been pointed out to the management. it was also on day two that i opened my curtains and saw that the river view room i would booked had transformed into a shadowy view of a dingy service road. | the actual night of my celebration was spent next door in the oxo, for a meal that was spot on... thereafter we returned to the rumpus room where i would come in advance of my party to order drinks. 45 minutes later and we were brought warm champagne and warm white wine. the g&amp;t's were passable. we ordered more drinks immediately, which took another 45 minutes to arrive. at the end of the night, to use up my minimum spend i had to order three magnums of warm champagne... these are all first world problems and at the same time, if you are considering spending thousands of pounds on celebrating an event, i would think twice before booking the mondrian. the exceptionally underwhelming ordeal cost me $15,000 which i wish i would spent elsewhere. | the cost was after management refunded me money for the rooms i would cancelled and the mondrian then re-booked. they then claimed that this was also a refund to cover my disappointment. they kindly offered preferential rates if i go and spend more money staying with them again. i really do not think so... | the hotel decor and location are great... the bar staff in the dandelyan are lovely. beware ""upgrades"", group stays, minimum spends and the rumpus room. | if you want the best bang for your buck, stay somewhere else and have a drink in the riverside dandelyan bar... you get to see the tactile/visual best of the hotel on a trip to the relieve yourself.'''",0,0

Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''my husband and i stayed at the mondrian overnight last saturday to celebrate his 40th birthday and go to a party. before arriving i had been contacted and asked if it was a special occasion, and i also booked 2 mud packs in the spa. on looking at this again it was clear that the mud packs were in separate male female hot rooms, and when i contacted them about this they arranged for us to be in the same room. we also arrived earlier than check in which i had informed the hotel about before. so all in all communication before arriving was helpful and responsive, and indicative of things to come. | we drove and when we arrived valet parking was on offer, which we declined - it was 45 pounds, and we dropped our stuff and drove 2 minutes down the road - and parked ourselves for 20 pounds. if you do go for valet parking just be aware that there as some very close car parks that are significantly cheaper! | check in was fine - but when we arrived in the room i realised i had mistakenly booked a room with 2 double beds in rather than 1 king size. no problem - the porter encouraged us to ring reception and they found another room for us, which they would make ready and move our belongings when we were in the spa. | we picked our keys up, and the porter moved our bags into a lovely room. 2 minutes later a knock at the door and we were delivered a cake to celebrate the birthday - a really lovely touch. | we went upstairs to the rumpus room (which i had booked) for a drink before we went out, and whilst this was not cheap a special treat to look out over the view and spoil ourselves a bit! | breakfast is a buffet with a wide selection of hot and cold breakfast food - we asked for fried and poached eggs that were brought to the table, but i do not remember it being obvious that you could ask for this. so do if you do not want scrambled eggs. | the room was spacious, the bathroom excellent and the staff (all staff - porters/receptionists/supervisor (who sorted my room mistake out - i have forgotten her name) were superb - nothing was too much trouble. overall this was very good value for where it is for a five star hotel in my opinion. i would definitely recommend it and definitely go back!'''",2,1
The Rembrandt,"'''first of all i must say, not all of it was bad - but seriously, 4 stars? | i arrived quite late in the evening, after a long flight from the you.s. was met by a rather arrogant young girl at the front desk, will not go in to details, as it got sorted out by management later on. otherwise very friendly and attentive reception staff. | the room itself was spacious - i had a club room on the 2nd floor, facing the v&amp;a. could of course hear the traffic noise, but was not very bothered. the stank of cigarette smoke from downstairs did on the other hand bother me, this was of course on the street, and not the hotel's fault - although they could advise their guests not to smoke right outside of the front doors. although the room was a bit ""worn out"", it was spotless at every time - except from one time when i found that the maid probably had washed the wine glass under the tap, and just let it dry up - i am not sure of this, but it certainly looked like it. i did not complain about it, as i still felt very uncomfortable after the episode when i arrived at the front desk. bathroom also seen it better days; but spotless, and lovely, lovely soft towels! | i quite enjoyed the room service, lovely food - i especially appreciated that the breakfast was included in the rate. again, one bad experience: waiter insisting on me having ordered two sets of breakfast for room service - which i obviously had not. i think he became a bit annoyed and wanted to take it all out again, but then i would be late for my meeting, so... again, a bit uncomfortable. | all in all, not too bad - have definently seen worse, but in this price range i would expect the little extras. will not come back at this point ( i think the girl the first night, pretty much ruined it ) - i prefer staying at the number sixteen...'''",1,1

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel is stunning - probably one of the most beautiful hotels in london. but at a minimum of 400 per night, i was flabbergasted when asked to pay 25 for my morning swim. the reason i was given? espa is independent of the hotel. well of course it is - most top hotels use espa, elemis or some other established spa brand. but they do not charge hotel guests for use of their pools. if espa at gleneagles do not charge then espa at corinthia should not charge either. if espa wants money from each guest that uses their pool then they should take this up with corinthia and collect the money from them instead. | i swim every morning and every evening. my stay was for 4 nights. if my wife had been with me then i would have had 400 of swimming charges added to my bill. completely outrageous. i declined the offer to pay 25 for 3 hours maximum in the pool and went to a nearby gym instead. one of the main reasons i chose the corinthia was for it is thermal floor. i left the hotel feeling duped as the policy is nowhere to be seen on their website - nor is it mentioned on check-in. if corinthia wants to be considered one of the finest hotels in london then it really must address this pay-as-you-swim charge. this is a 5-star hotel - not an easyjet flight.'''",1,0

The Savoy,"'''my friend and i decided to treat ourselves and were really looking forward to our champagne afternoon tea at the savoy during our weekend trip to london. whilst we enjoyed it, it could certainly have been better and we cannot help feeling disappointed. the staff were very friendly and helpful and we had two of them looking after us initially. unfortunately it seemed as though we had hit staff break time as they both disappeared one after another, leaving us with no tea and not being looked. after a while they returned and we were able to get our tea replenished. we also needed to get new cups as the tea left at the bottom of each cup had gone completely cold. we each ate 2 pastries and asked for the pieces of cake to be packed up so we could take them away. we were told that we could not do this due to health and safety!!! we then saw 2 boxes being taken to another table so when we were paying our bill i asked again, and also why some tables were able to get a takeaway. i was told that they had paid for additional pastries from the shop and that we could do that but we were unable to take the ones with us that were on our table. again it was explained to us that this is due to health and safety and the cakes in the shop containing more preservatives. the waiter also admitted that this made no sense but it was down to the decision of the chef. so our cakes just went to waste. we also saw that residents were treated differently to us being none residents. the residents were told that they could have the cakes taken to their room and also some additional sandwiches for their children!!! how is this possible with the lack of preservatives in the cakes i wonder!!! at a cost of 140 (inc service) i cannot believe that the savoy is not able to provide guests that cannot eat all their afternoon tea with the option of taking some home and would rather let food go to waste and be thrown away!! health and safety gone mad!!! maybe the chef should review his menu!!!!'''",0,0

The Savoy,"'''we stayed at the savoy last year, a surprise birthday gift from my husband and even more of a celbration as i just discovered i was pregnant. the stay was superb, despite the first room being tatty...the helpful staff quickly changed rooms and provided a bottle of lauren-perrier. | this year we returned with our four month old son, booked directly with the hotel this time and upgraded the room. | how disappointed. we checked in 10 mins before 2pm, but still our room was not ready ""a problem with the room"" we were told. i had booked an early check-in. i explained that we had a 4 month old and that we had been travelling since 6am and would need a room pronto....with reluctance a room was found. it was lovely, however, london was 32c and the room had no airconditioning! i politley exaplined that we would require the rrom to have functional aircon and reminded them that there is medical evidence to support that infants sleeping in rooms above 18c are at risk of cot death and once more with reluctance the supervisor suggested a new room would be found. | we returned to the room one hour later after a walk around penhalligons in covent garden and discovered that our luggage (which was in the previous room ) had gone missing! we had reservations for afternoon tea in the thames foyer at 1630hrs, it was now 1610hrs with only 20 mins to get changed and refreshed. with no sign of the luggage i returned to reception and their very helpful customer relations manager (isabelle) comp'd the afternoon tea and arranged for our luggage to appear and a suite to be arranged. | after tea i thought all my christmasses had come at once. the suite was fantastic with a view directly over the london eye. the room was hot but we were assured the aircon worked.....famous last words. at 9pm the room was a sauna and my ""grobag"" thermometer showed that the room was far too hot for our son to sleep in....over 27c. once more called down to reception and minutes later 3 fans arrived!!!!!!!!!! | martino the night manager was fantastic, even to the point of assissting in finding us alternative hotel accomodation. we were at 11pm....phew...in bed in the smallest room in the hotel, not what i had booked, but with functional aircon. he informed me that the whole hotel had had no aircon for the past three days and only some rooms were now working. | i beleived that the staff should have had the integrity to inform us of this at time of check-in. our first night was a disaster and the following night (also complementary as a result) was tinged bitter sweet. with health and safelty issues this hotel needs to remeber that its customers comfort is priority. people may visit the savoy on the basis of its great name (and location) but they also want to have the facilities advertised functional and to hand. this did not happen on our stay and as a result, more so, of the unforthcoming reception staff my family will not be returning. | however, the restaurant staff...thames foyer, riverview and the grill are superb and cannot be faulted. a pity the reception staff could not take a leaf out of their book.'''",0,1

Rhodes Hotel,"'''travelling to london for the first time with 4 teenaged girls, i was looking for a hotel that was reasonably priced and would accomodate five women in one room. rhodes hotel was one of the very few that would sleep 5 in a reasonable price range. the room was a decent size, especially considering it had a double bed, a single bed and a set of bunk beds in it. there was a mid-sized armoire and desk, as well as a refridgerator and coffee maker. the bathroom was quite small, and rather old, but clean. there was not much room for the large amount of luggage we had, but we made do. we travelled in august and it was warm, but at night we would put the air on and the room would cool off within a reasonable amount of time. there was a bit of street noise in the early night, but it was generally quiet thoughout the night. we were on the third floor and there were alot of stairs and no elevator, but honestly, we were not in the room much so we avoided extra trips by thinking ahead. the breakfast room was in the basement, so it was a bit of a hike up and down in the morning to breakfast, but the food was very good and the owner made for interesting conversation. there was also a computer available for guests next to the breakfast room which was a nice bonus. | the owners were very helpful and watchful. maria offered alot of suggestions on buses and tube routes, as well as general info on nice places to visit. we travelled to london 4 weeks after the first tube bombing in july of 2005, so safety was a big concern for us, but the hotel itself offered a nice safe atmosphere. the neighborhood also seemed safe, any crime in the area may have been attributed to all the police being on the subway. the tubes were very well guarded, and while i had originally thought of avoiding them, we ended up riding them every day and we felt quite safe. while i would not say this was a fancy hotel, it was decent and it did house the five of us at a reasonable rate.'''",1,1

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''we have stayed in many luxury hotels in london but this is by far the best! every little detail just works. | the lobby area is stunning with a huge domed roof housing an amazing light installation. vases of beautiful pink flowers add a splash of colour to the shiny marble surfaces. everything oozes class. however this is not one of those hotels where the impressive decor fails to last beyond the lifts. the corridors themselves are luxurious- i never thought i would find myself excited by a corridor but they just feel sumptuous. the class continues in the bedrooms- our room had three huge windows and a glimpse of the river, a large bathroom with a rain shower, endless supplies of fluffy towels, a tv over a huge bath, the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in, a nespresso machine, a media hub which allows you to connect pcs and ipods to the tv, quality espa toiletries, atmospheric lighting, all within tasteful, comfortable decor. when we returned to the room in the evening, rather than finding the standard cheap chocolate on the pillow we found a little box of retro sweets instead. the maid had even put water and glasses by the bed, as if they knew we would be waking up a little hungover.the most impressive thing however was the silence. i did not hear a single noise from another room for the duration of our stay. | the service was also fantastic, there is none of the snootiness you get in some 5* hotels, everyone was friendly and we were made to feel relaxed. the atmosphere in the hotel is unlike anything i have come across- they do not try too hard to be trendy, it does not feel stuffy-it is just perfect. this hotel, unlike so many others, is able to deliver an experience which justifies its high room rates.'''",2,2
The Savoy,"'''six months ago, we picked the savoy over other hotels because of a 3 night/get one free deal. we booked 2 suites, with a confirmation that had a cancellation fee and noted ""best available rate."" because they do not check you in, they and we did not confirm the deal at the start of our stay. at the end of our stay, the hotel claimed that because we did not confirm the stay 3/get one free in their language, they refused to give us the deal. they admitted the deal was offered when we booked, but claimed that we needed the right confirmation language, so no credit, no free night, despite spending a fortune at the hotel. the manager argued with me, which was really deploring. add to this, the third night, the roof flooded - a down pour - on to our bed, and we had to move all of our belongings to other rooms that were much less accommodating - no closet, old furniture, small bathroom with one sink. we did not complain because we expected the one night free. even upon raising this issue, the savoy would not budge and give us the deal available when we booked. the ritz would never have treated a customer this way. do not stay here.'''",0,0
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''i have nothing but praise for this hotel. the owners are on site and the staff are wonderful, so friendly and helpful. ok, the rooms are not large, but you expect that in london, and these rooms are spotlessly clean. the location is excellent with buses almost at the door - kings cross, euston and st.pancras mainline stations are 10 minutes away, and russell st.tube goes direct to heathrow. it is a short walk to the british museum, and a little bit further to the main shopping strip, oxford st. goodge st tube is 5 minutes away, as are the many and varied restaurants of fitzrovia. i found this hotel on the tripadvisor website and was swayed by the good reports from others - so glad that they were true!'''",2,2
The Savoy,"'''the savoy has to be my favorite hotel anywhere. the staff here is the most caring, helpful and polite. the welcome you receive when arriving continues throughout the lobby, reception, room attendants, and restaurant staff. the rooms are immaculate, food delicious and i will repeat... the staff cannot do more for you. | only con: one of the girls in reception, she was very good technically, but her people skills were lacking. just not the person you want to get for a first impression of the savoy'''",2,2
The Rembrandt,"'''we have always booked to stay at this hotel, and it has always been a pleasure staying here. there was a problem with our reservation through booking.com, so we went to speak to a staff at the front desk. we spoke to ugne and anamaria, they kept their smile on as long as we were there, were really helpful and polite with us. our stay was made better thanks to them.'''",2,2
The Savoy,'''i booked the savoy as a special surprise for my parents anniversary. from the word go the administration was poor. nobody seemed to realise that i had booked this for them and they would be the guests not me! | they arrived and were advised they had to pay but i had called previously and was advised all ok. no prior contact by email or phone before they arrived and was then emailed a payment page in order to pay. | restaurant was average and food poorly presented. | anniversary card was addressed to me not my parents! | on check out they tried to charge my parents for the champagne i had already paid for and this took another 15mijs to resolve. | all in all it ruined what was supposed to be a special gift for my parents and i feel really let down by the whole thing. the place has lost its sparkle full stop. | would not recommend to my friends or colleagues. | i am not normally inclined to report on trip advisor but i feel so dissappointed i would not want anyone to spend such a large amount on a similarly below average experience all round.''',0,0
"The Wellesley Knightsbridge, a Luxury Collection Hotel, London","'''staff, location and furnishings are excellent , however ; | very small hotel. (36 rooms) | limited space and services. | low ceilings , cramped feeling. | odour of cigars from lounge when entering lobby. | an acquired taste really, and not for families with young children . | however , i do feel it is suitable for a couples weekend. | we prefer grand lobbies , more common areas and larger spaces.'''",1,1
Ridgemount Hotel,"'''we stayed at this hotel for four nights and we had a room on the ground floor just next to the reception which meant it was very noisy, when other guests came home late at night and rang the doorbell. | room was clean and had strong wifi. staff was very helpful regarding logistics when planing the day. | would stay there again but would ask for a room facing the gardens and not on the ground floor.'''",1,1
The Rembrandt,"'''we are just back from our 2 night trip to london and enjoyed our stay in the rembrandt hotel and had a fantastic time in london. nice decor in reception and was greeted by friendly staff on arrival. we stayed in a double superior room on the 6th floor (641) with great views of the v&amp;a museum which was directly across the road. i had requested a front-facing room when booking. from walking around the hotel, i would assume that some rooms would not have had much of a view, so it might be a good idea to make a request such as this when booking. rooms are small, but we have certainly stayed in smaller! the fully-stocked mini-bar was a nice touch and we had a jucuzzi bath in our bathroom too. breakfast was great. nice selection of hot food, cereals and the usual continental bits also. we had a full english to set us up for the day each morning. tube station is literally 2 mins walk away. take the exit that is signposted 'museums' when exiting south kensington station and head right on exiting to take you to the hotel. would love to go back to see the natural history museum and the v&amp;a which are right beside the hotel, but we went to winter wonderland in hyde park and spent a day on oxford street instead, so maybe next time! overall a positive experience. only small negative would be that the walls between the bathrooms backing onto the room next to ours were perhaps a little thin! small bit of soundproofing would not go astray there! could not hear any noise from the bedroom however so it was not much of a complaint. great hotel, would definetly recommend.'''",2,2

The Rembrandt,'''found this hotel on secret escapes website as a special offer. | good location opposite the v &amp; a museum and 10 mins from harrods. lots of eating places nearby. | however hotel was a typical old london hotel. hotel room quite small and dated though comfortable. no view from | bedroom window. breakfast was included this was ok. | in in all we were a bit disappointed nothing to rave about this hotel. would not go back and compared to the chelsea garden hotel where we stayed last year when we went to see chelsea flower show not a patch on the chelsea hotel.''',0,1
The Rembrandt,"'''we stayed here on a secrets escapes deal and we just could not fault it. we stayed in room 333 a gorgeous room with a giant sized bed and a jacuzzi . the view was of the v and a museum. it was a special anniversary weekend and the upgrade ,bottle of wine and lovely card from the manager was very much appreciated. the staff were all lovely and the service was second to none. we are not frequent visitors to london our last trip was over three years ago but we definitely be making the rembrantdt our first choice on future visits.'''",2,2
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''i chose this hotel to celebrate my marriage with my dearest friends. under guidance of the staff of the hotel i chose the room ""river view balcony"" for the three nights stay so to enjoy the beautiful view over the city and the extra space in the room for private toasts. | the reservation had occurred a few months before the date of staying and marriage to have time to develop the refreshments into the prestigious rumpus bar with choice of wines and canaps. | at this point my wife and i left a credit card each to guarantee all reservations. | upon arrival at the hotel last february after an inexplicable lack of knowledge about my card details i was asked for a credit card to guarantee the booking so i re-submitted my mastercard for it. | the amount keyed in however exceeded the price of the staying of 100 per night just in case of extras but the concierge said promptly this was just a pre-booking precaution and that the exact amount would be taken at the end of staying and that any remaining money from it would come back into my account right away. | despite our initial reluctance of such procedure, taking into account my wife had already paid in advance for the refreshments, we understood this was just the hotel policy so we trusted the hotel staff. | room: the large space with sublime views of the thames and the city enjoys a modern and stylish decor. the room has large windows so it is rather cold and boasts of a unique heating system with heat pumps of which only one functioning over the bed and extremely noisy. no heating in the master bathroom and in the guest one. the technician sent to us by the concierge could not tell us why and what neither of it nor to make it works. | rumpus bar: upon arrival with our friends we discovered that the reserved space is not the one chosen months ago with a view of the thames and the city. negotiations were long not to mention frustrating and involved also one of the guests considering the unique event; eventually the manager of the bar has solved by moving us in front of the windows and personally taking care of all the refreshments. | service: in general the hotel staff was very kind but throughout the period has been shown to be lacking in professionalism and preparation with customers. it has been very frustrating having to ask for everything when in the hotel of such category you expect outstanding service and fast solution problems. very serious the total lack of communication when in the middle of the night the fire alarm went off, leaving all guests unaware and worried about the problem. | check out: at the time of payment i have listed all the inconveniences suffered to the manager that as apology deducted a night fare from the total bill. having already left a larger sum at the beginning of the booking i was issued the invoice for the actual amount payable and guaranteed that the remaining amount would be returned in my availability within 24 hours. | it took 15 days to un-locked the sum initially frozen upon arrival at the hotel. during that period the amount actually collected by the hotel has weighed further on the amount set aside as a pre-booking precaution leaving me in serious trouble here in italy. during these days my wife had to call and write to the managers of the hotel to resolve the matter. to note the total lack of service and professionalism demonstrated once again by the staff heedless of the damage that such freezing sum caused to my personal life. | despite being in a perfect area and looking beautiful this hotel need to decide whether to decrease the stars and the prices or change personnel before many other customers encounter these same problems if not more ruining the reputation of mondrian as a chain.'''",0,1
The Savoy,"'''the savoy was a huge treat for us and it was a huge let down. the door staff welcomed us to the hotel and after that, that is where it went wrong. we were looked upon like we were not good enough to be at the hotel. we arrived with just small rucksacks as it was only an overnight stay so perhaps we did not look the ""class act"" that normally stays at the hotel. staff on reception treated us with disdain and furthermore did nothing, absolutely nothing to wow us. not what you expect from a 5*. i am lucky enough to have stayed in luxury hotels across the world and this just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. the room was hot and the a/c hard to adjust to get it cool enough (in the middle of winter!). | my partner and i felt like we were second class citizens and simply just not good enough. what should have been an amazing experience was marred by the service and welcome (or rather un-welcome) we received. i wrote in to express my thoughts and feedback and to date (over a week later) i am still waiting for a reply. simply not good enough.'''",1,0
The Savoy,"'''met some colleagues here for a business meeting and the facilities were what you would expect but overall it came over as another over hyped hotel. | the food was excellent in the riverside restaurant and actually good value for what you received, we even had glenda jackson on the table adjacent to ourselves. | facilities and staff great but the place is dusty.'''",1,1
"Hotel Xenia, Autograph Collection","'''we stayed last week at xenia for the first time. it looks nice from the outside as we regularly drive past on cromwell road. | booked a classic room for two for over 220pn and delighted when we were told at check-in we had been upgraded to a deluxe room. | delight quickly turned to disappointment when we reached the room as the size was smaller than expected and the bathroom even more so! the bathroom door had to be closed to access the vanity, and with the door closed it was difficult to dry oneself without knocking the walls. there is no light over the vanity which was also a frustration. the shower was a good size, though feeble water pressure and with no secondary pump on the hot water supply, it took forever for the hot water to reach the taps. quite surprising for a four star (?) hotel. | there were no luggage racks in the room. why is it that this fundamental requirement is so often overlooked? | breakfast was great and the staff were terrific but sadly our room was disappointing. we did not enquire as to the size of their classic or petite rooms!'''",1,1
"Bulgari Hotel, London",'''a very stylish hotel with italian touches all over it... booked for afternoon tea....and as soon as i entered the place i got disappointed... the place where they serve the afternoon tea is really dark.... actually they just place you in the corner by the fireplace... the afternoon tea was nothing special .. i was quite disappointed !!! the hotel is fad although!!!!''',1,1
"Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London","'''we have been a fan of mandarin oriental hotels for a few years now and are happy to pay a premium to stay in a fab room and receive their legendary service, as it is totally worth the extra cash. unfortunately this hotel was not up to the same standards as the others we have stayed in. | the room itself was tired - both in terms of the furniture and the decor. the curtains were pretty dirty, and the blinds did not fit to the window, so as soon as the sun came up we had light streaming in, so we were awake at 5am and could not get the blinds or curtains to close over it! | in the bathroom, the bath surface was peeling away leaving a grubby brown colour all over the bath. i called reception to let them know and see if we could move to a room with a cleaner bath. the guy on reception responded that lots of the baths are like this because they are so old and that we would not be able to move room. a supervisor was apparently sent to the room after a relatively abrupt phone call with the guy on the desk, but he/she never showed up! that is pretty poor for a mandarin! we complained again on check out and did get the service charge refunded, which was ok. just definitely something to look out for before you unpack, as it is not nice at all! | the rest of the hotel is also looking tired and in need of a refurb. we noticed the walls in the park restuarant had stains all up them and it felt pretty grubby and dated. the service in the restaurant in the evening and at breakfast was excellent though and we had some fab, delicious meals together. | considering the standard of the room and the patchy servivce we received, it was not good value for money. the hotel was expensive and i do not feel we had the same fab experience that we have consistently seen in other mandarin hotels. this is my first review on a mandarin that has not been perfect! very very disappointing. | next time we stay in london, we will stay elsewhere, probably for a cheaper price, and perhaps just eat in the restaurant here instead!'''",1,1
Mondrian London at Sea Containers,"'''we visited the hotel during july on a rare child free evening and from the start were unsure about our experience, firstly the room was not ready so we were ushered through to the cocktail bar with a voucher for free drinks,which was fabulous! | once the room was ready we headed up to get ready for the evening and were disappointed again,what was advertised as a superior room in our opinion was a standard room. | our evening was spent in central london and our next experience in the hotel was breakfast which was a real treat, i especially liked sitting out on the hampton's terrace and enjoyed the views whilst eating breakfast, which was great, there was a good selection and a freshly cooked option also. | we did venture down to the spa but found it to be very detached and having separate steam rooms for us was a bit pointless, the spa design was interesting but i am not sure how relaxing it was! | so our experience was like a roller coaster of disappointment and then a squeeze of magic?!?'''",1,1
Rhodes Hotel,'''first we did not feel comfortable in the standard triple room being so small in which we were almost making a bump dance. the day after they have changed our room to deluxe triple room with a sofa. newly refurbished room contains jacuzzi as well. the boss says that his hotel has the best refurbished baths in the sussex gardens area. high ceilings and air escape from the window make the room very cold. the heater's panel is so large but only heats itself. the fan they brought was most powerful heater i have seen. it was enough to make the room warm. the breakfast room was tiny. the boss has plans to enlarge it in the very near future. variety of breakfast was not so satisfactory. the last day the boss prepared omlette and served specially for us. it was a nice gesture from the boss nearly 35 yrs in the hotel business.''',1,1

Corinthia Hotel London,"'''this hotel is in a perfect location, across the street from embankment tube station, and which has a pedestrian bridge to cross the thames where you will be at the foot of the eye... the corinthia was a 2 minute walk to trafalgar square, and literally within 10 minutes walk to almost every theatre in the west end!!!! | the beauty of this hotel is in the all the fine details... the common areas are stunning, and the restaurants are incredibly beautiful. we ate breakfast daily in northhall. our room package included a british breakfast. the food was great however we ordered our eggs as the scramble they serve are a little too liquid for our taste.... the rooms- we had a king superior our first 2 nights which was very nicely appointed.. although views are the not the strong point if this property, the room itself makes up for it. the bedroom area is wonderfully appointed with harrods brand refreshments, wonderful plates and glasses to use and a nespresso espresso machine. the bathroom is a delight with a large bathtub, an amazing shower, and nice vanity area...the only drawback is the limited sized closet.... do not expect to put a weeks worth of clothing in there.... | on our third day we experienced a horrible sewer smell.. engineering was sent and they thought they repaired the problem but an hour later when we returned to the room, the smell was even worse. the front desk manager promised to move us to another room.... my partner and i packed and waited.... i called again and was told the keys would be right up... 40 minutes later i went to the front desk to move ourselves... the manager could not have been more polite and apologetic for the delay... he immediately made keys and got a bellman cart himself to assist us with our move... he even upgraded us to a beautiful riverview suite- which was the most beautiful set i have ever stayed in europe. this was a nice way to end our stay and a wonderful example of the great service provided by the staff of this property. | the espa spa is very nice and the hydrotherapy wet area and sauna were perfect after long days of walking in the beautiful west end...'''",2,1

Rhodes Hotel,"'''my fiance and i booked to stay for four nights at the rhodes in a superior room: i guess it is superior to their other rooms, but it was barely adequate.. breakfast was very poor, very limited choice, bread was straight out of the fridge and cold, and a piece of toast that we picked had mould on it. english breakfast was ok, but cost extra. on day two 750 gbp of electronics was stolen from our room. the hotel proprietors said ""this has never happened before"". however, i remembered that a reviewer had posted in december that some of their stuff was stolen and, when i mentioned this, the proprietress said ""there are doubts about that"" and told me they had told tripadvisor to remove the comment (and indeed i see that it has gone now). if they tell ta to remove my review, i will keep re-posting it. there is no security at all at the hotel: the front door is permanently unlocked; whoever sits at reception has a computer screen in front of them so that they cannot see people coming in and out (the proprietors denied this, but if i cannot see the receptionist how can he see me?); there are no cameras; there was no safe in the room; the proprietor said ""they recommend"" putting valuables in the safe at reception, and showed us a piece of paper saying guests ""can"" put stuff in this safe, but at no point did they advise us to do so. when we reported the theft the cleaning lady came upstairs and rifled through the drawers containing my fiance's clothes (in front of my fiance - incredible!) despite the lack of security, it seems inconceivable that someone came in from the street, climbed four flights of stairs, and happened to go into our room. throughout all of this the proprietors were incredibly rude, and their attitude was simply that the incident did not happen, on the basis that they have been in the business for many years and are good judges of character (their words) - so a member of staff could not be the cuplrit - and, as stated, it is incredibly unlikely that someone came in from the street: hence we must be lying. of course, the case will never be proven in court because (as the policeman who came to record the incident told us) the police do not have the resources to pursue petty crimes like this. we decided not to stay the last night, for which we had had to pay upon arrival (before seeing the room): the proprietress refused to refund us for the night we would not be staying because it was hotel policy; and, if they were to do so, it would be down to the ""goodwill of the hotel"", but that goodwill was not present ""because you said you would post a bad review on tripadvisor"" (her exact words). i would strongly advise people not to stay at the rhodes. the proprietors are the rudest i have ever encountered in any hotel in any country before (i am 50, i travel for work, and i have stayed in a lot of hotels!) i find all of the positive reviews about the place very suspicious, unless people have incredibly low standards. then again the hotel tell simply ta to remove reviews they do not like, so maybe that explains it. we moved down the road to the darlington, which was ultra-secure, had better rooms, had a great breakfast (all included in the price), and extremely polite and helpful staff - and was significantly cheaper!!'''",0,0
